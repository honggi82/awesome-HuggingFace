GUI grounding, which localizes interface elements from screenshots given natural language queries, remains challenging for small icons and dense layouts. Test-time zoom-in methods improve localization by cropping and re-running inference at higher resolution, but apply cropping uniformly across all instances with fixed crop sizes, ignoring whether the model is actually uncertain on each case. We propose UI-Zoomer, a training-free adaptive zoom-in framework that treats both the trigger and scale of zoom-in as a prediction uncertainty quantification problem. A confidence-aware gate fuses spatial consensus among stochastic candidates with token-level generation confidence to selectively trigger zoom-in only when localization is uncertain. When triggered, an uncertainty-driven crop sizing module decomposes prediction variance into inter-sample positional spread and intra-sample box extent, deriving a per-instance crop radius via the law of total variance. Extensive experiments on ScreenSpot-Pro, UI-Vision, and ScreenSpot-v2 demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines across multiple model architectures, achieving gains of up to +13.4%, +10.3%, and +4.2% respectively, with no additional training required.

### 1 Introduction

Grounding natural language instructions to interface elements is a fundamental capability for autonomous GUI agents Gou et al. (2024); Tang et al. (2025a,c); Xu et al. (2025); Hong et al. (2024); Lin et al. (2024); Jiang et al. (2025); Yang et al. (2023). Despite significant progress through supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning Qin et al. (2025); Xu et al. (2024); Xie et al. (2025); Yuan et al. (2025); Gu et al. (2025), models still fail systematically on small icons and dense layouts in complex interfaces Li et al. (2025).

A natural remedy is test-time zoom-in scaling: crop a region of the screenshot and re-run the model at higher effective resolution Wu et al. (2025a); Luo et al. (2025); Nguyen (2024); Lee et al. (2025).While this paradigm has shown clear promise for fine-grained GUI localization Wu et al. (2025a); Luo et al. (2025), a more fundamental question remains unaddressed: which instances actually need zoom-in, and how much should we zoom?

Existing zoom-in methods share two fundamental limitations. First, they apply cropping indiscriminately: Wu et al. (2025a) zooms in unconditionally on every sample with a fixed scaling factor, while Luo et al. (2025) triggers zoom-in only upon execution errors, with no regard to whether the model is actually uncertain on the instance at hand. We show empirically that unconditional zoom-in on ScreenSpot-v2 degrades accuracy below the direct prediction baseline while significantly increasing latency (Table 1), as easy cases lose the global context the model was already exploiting. Second, all existing methods fix the crop window to a predetermined ratio Wu et al. (2025a); Luo et al. (2025); Lee et al. (2025), regardless of whether candidates are tightly clustered or widely scattered, leaving the crop either too broad to improve resolution or too narrow to retain critical context.

- Figure 1 Comparison of GUI grounding paradigms. (a) Direct grounding methods struggle with dense interfaces. (b) Iterative cropping methods incur large resource costs and use rigid cropping ratios. (c) Our UI-Zoomer applies Test-Time Scaling (TTS) with reliability gating, adaptively choosing between consensus voting and adaptive cropping, achieving stronger robustness with one-take time costs.

The root cause is that these methods treat all instances uniformly, without consulting the model’s own prediction behavior. Recent work shows that spatial agreement across stochastic samples correlates with localization reliability Du et al. (2025), and that coordinate likelihoods near a predicted point follow a smooth Gaussian distribution in pixel space Lee et al. (2025), confirming that VLMs implicitly encode continuous spatial uncertainty. The variance of sampled predictions Wang et al. (2026); Du et al. (2025) thus encodes both whether the model is confused and over what spatial extent, which is precisely the information needed to gate zoom-in and size the crop window. This motivates a simple but previously unexplored principle: zoom only when uncertain, and zoom by how much the predictions disagree.

Table 1 Accuracy and inference time of w/ and w/o iterative cropping on ScreenSpot-V2.

Building on this insights, we propose UI-Zoomer, a training-free adaptive zoom-in framework for GUI grounding. UI-Zoomer first draws N stochastic candidates from the model and computes a reliability score by fusing spatial consensus with token-level confidence; instances that pass the gate are resolved immediately by consensus voting. For uncertain instances, the crop window is derived from the variance of candidate predictions decomposed into inter-sample positional spread and intra-sample box extent, yielding a per-instance radius that contracts for easy cases and expands for hard ones. A single deterministic re-inference pass on the resulting crop completes the refinement.

Extensive experiments on three widely-adopted GUI grounding benchmarks, ScreenSpot-Pro, UI-Vision, and ScreenSpot-v2, demonstrate that UI-Zoomer consistently improves over strong baselines, achieving gains of up to +13.4%, +10.3%, and +4.2% respectively. Icon targets benefit more than text targets on average, consistent with the intuition that compact and semantically ambiguous elements profit most from high-resolution refinement. Ablations confirm the independent contribution of each component and the advantage of adaptive crop sizing over any fixed-ratio alternative.

Our contributions are threefold:

- • We propose UI-Zoomer, a training-free adaptive zoom-in framework that frames the trigger and scale of zoom-in as a prediction uncertainty quantification problem.
- • UI-Zoomer comprises a confidence-aware gate that avoids unnecessary computation by routing only

- uncertain instances to refinement, and a Gaussian-based adaptive crop sizing module that derives the crop window from the variance of candidate predictions.
- • Extensive experiments on ScreenSpot-Pro, UI-Vision, and ScreenSpot-v2 demonstrate consistent improvements across four model architectures, with gains of up to +13.4% on ScreenSpot-Pro.

### 2 Related Work

- 2.1 GUI Grounding

GUI grounding requires predicting the pixel coordinates of an interface element given a screenshot and a natural language instruction. Early work builds pipeline-based systems that chain OCR, icon detectors, and LLMs for planning and element selection Zhang et al. (2025); Wang et al. (2024); Li et al. (2024); Agashe et al. (2024); Zhang et al. (2025); Liu et al. (2024); Yang et al. (2023); Bai et al. (2021); Xu et al. (2024); Wu et al. (2024); Tang et al. (2025b); Wu et al. (2025b); Agashe et al. (2025). A second generation trains specialist VLMs end-to-end on large-scale GUI corpora, with models such as UGround Gou et al. (2024), OS-Atlas Wu

- et al. (2024), and UI-TARS Qin et al. (2025) demonstrating strong cross-platform generalization. More recently, reinforcement fine-tuning has emerged as a data-efficient alternative: methods including UI-R1 Lu
- et al. (2025a), GUI-G2 Tang et al. (2025a), SE-GUI Yuan et al. (2025), and UI-Venus Gu et al. (2025) apply GRPO-style objectives with coordinate accuracy rewards, matching or exceeding SFT models trained on orders of magnitude more data. Despite these advances, all training-time approaches share a hard ceiling at high resolution: once a target element is too small to resolve in a standard forward pass, additional training provides diminishing returns Wu et al. (2025a); Luo et al. (2025).

- 2.2 Test-Time Scaling for GUI Grounding

Test-time scaling improves model performance at inference without modifying parameters Snell et al. (2024). In GUI grounding, the dominant paradigm is zoom-in inference: DiMo-GUI Wu et al. (2025a) applies iterative zoom-in with a fixed crop ratio; RegionFocus Luo et al. (2025) triggers zoom-in upon execution errors; ReGUIDE Lee et al. (2025) uses KDE over multiple predictions to identify a high-density crop center; Nguyen Nguyen (2024) proposes successive iterative narrowing. A parallel thread exploits prediction consistency as a reliability signal: GUI-RC Du et al. (2025) constructs spatial voting grids over stochastic samples to identify consensus regions; SafeGround Wang et al. (2026) derives calibrated uncertainty estimates from spatial dispersion with statistical guarantees; GUI-Eyes Chen et al. (2026) trains models via RL to actively decide when to invoke zoom tools. These methods either apply cropping regardless of per-instance confidence, or use consistency signals purely for voting without connecting them to crop sizing. UI-Zoomer unifies both perspectives by using prediction variance to simultaneously gate zoom-in and derive per-instance crop windows.

- 3 Method

- 3.1 Problem Setup

Given a GUI screenshot I ∈ RH×W×3 and a natural-language instruction q, we predict a click location pˆ ∈ [0,1]2 in normalized image coordinates. We represent each localization hypothesis as an axis-aligned bounding box b = [x1,y1,x2,y2] and define the click as its center:

pˆ =

x1 + x2 2

,

y1 + y2 2

. (1)

As shown in Figure 2, UI-Zoomer proceeds in three stages: (1) global multi-sampling, (2) reliability gating, and (3) adaptive crop and zoom. The full procedure is summarized in Algorithm 1.

- 9: return center(MapBack(bˆ)) map back to global coords (Eq. 11)
- 10: end if

#### 3.2 Stage 1: Global Multi-Sampling

We sample N=8 candidate boxes from M at temperature T=0.9 and discard invalid parses. For each valid candidate i we record the predicted box bi and estimate a scalar confidence from the geometric mean of token probabilities:

1 Li

Li

ci = exp

log pi,t , (2)

t=1

where Li is the sequence length and pi,t is the probability of the t-th token.

#### 3.3 Stage 2: Reliability Gating

When candidates are consistent and confident, zoom-in is unnecessary and costly. We quantify this reliability through two complementary signals and use their combination to selectively trigger refinement.

- 3.3.1 Spatial consensus. We quantify cross-sample agreement by the mean pairwise IoU:

Cspatial =

1 N(N − 1) i̸=j

IoU(bi,bj). (3)

- 3.3.2 Gating score. We combine spatial consensus with average token confidence:

S = Cspatial + c,¯ c¯ =

1 N

N

i=1

ci. (4)

The two signals are complementary: Cspatial is sensitive to positional scatter while c¯ reflects sharpness of the predictive distribution over coordinate tokens. When S > τ, we trust the global predictions and return immediately.

- 3.3.3 Consensus voting. We select the candidate with the most peer support, breaking ties by confidence:

vi =

j̸=i

I[IoU(bi,bj) > 0.5], i⋆ = arg max

i

(vi, ci). (5)

- 3.4 Stage 3: Uncertainty-Driven Adaptive Crop

When S ≤ τ, candidates are unreliable and zoom-in is warranted. Rather than using a fixed crop ratio, we derive the crop window directly from the variance of the candidate set.

##### 3.4.1 Outlier filtering.

A small number of erratic samples can inflate the estimated variance and produce an oversized crop. We therefore discard outliers by retaining only the K = ⌊0.75N⌋ candidates whose centers lie closest to the median center z˜:

di = ∥zi − z˜∥2, K = arg topK

{−di}, (6) where zi denotes the center of bi. We compute subsequent statistics over K.

i

##### 3.4.2 Variance decomposition.

We model the unknown target location Z as a latent random variable and apply the law of total variance coordinate-wise:

Var(Z) = Var(E[Z | I])

+E[Var(Z | I)]

. (7)

vinter

vintra

The inter-sample term captures positional disagreement across draws:

1 K i∈K

1 K i∈K

(zi − µ)⊙2, µ =

zi. (8)

vinter =

The intra-sample term encodes the predicted scale of each element. Treating each box as a Gaussian spanning ±2σ of its width and height:

si 4

1 K i∈K

⊙2

vintra =

, (9)

where si = [six,siy]⊤ is the width and height of bi. The two terms are complementary: vinter expands the crop when candidates disagree on position; vintra ensures the crop is at least as large as the predicted element even when candidates coincide.

- 3.4.3 Crop window. We set the crop radius as r = γσ, where σ = √vinter + vintra. To avoid degenerate crops and aspect-ratio distortions, we impose a minimum side length m and squarify:

s = max(2rx,2ry,m), [xc1,y1c,xc2,y2c] = [µx − 2s, µy − 2s, µx + 2s, µy + 2s]. (10) If the window extends beyond image boundaries, we shift it inward while preserving its size.

- 3.4.4 Zoom and map back.

We crop I to this window, resize it to the model’s resolution budget, and run a single deterministic pass (T=0) to obtain a refined box bˆ in crop coordinates. We map it back to global normalized coordinates via:

xc1 + xwˆ c W

y1c + y hˆ c H

x =

, y =

, (11)

where wc = xc2 −xc1 and hc = y2c −y1c. If refinement produces an invalid box, we fall back to the most confident global candidate.

### 4 Experiments

#### 4.1 Setup

- 4.1.1 Benchmarks.

We evaluate on three benchmarks spanning different difficulty regimes. ScreenSpot-Pro Li et al. (2025) targets 4K professional desktop environments across 23 applications, with unusually small and dense targets. ScreenSpot-v2 Wu et al. (2024) is a multi-platform benchmark covering mobile, desktop, and web interfaces with 1,200+ instructions. UI-Vision Nayak et al. (2025) covers fine-grained desktop grounding across 83 real-world applications, including element grounding, layout grounding, and action prediction. Following prior work Cheng et al. (2024); Li et al. (2025), we report click accuracy: a prediction is correct if the output point falls within the ground-truth bounding box.

- 4.1.2 Models.

We evaluate our method using two categories of base models: (1) general-purpose VLMs, i.e., Qwen2.5-VL7B Bai et al. (2025), an open-source multimodal model pretrained on large-scale data; and (2) GUI-specific VLMs, including UI-Venus-7B, UI-Venus-72B Gu et al. (2025), and GUI-G2-7B Tang et al. (2025a), which are tailored for GUI understanding and grounding. Notably, both UI-Venus and GUI-G2 are further enhanced with reinforcement learning, leading to stronger task-specific alignment for UI interaction and more reliable GUI grounding behaviors.

- 4.1.3 Implementation.

All evaluations are conducted on 4 NVIDIA RTX 4090D 24G GPUs. We use the vLLM engine with a context length of 16,384 tokens. We sample N=8 candidates at temperature T=0.9 and set the minimum crop side to m=512 pixels. The gating threshold τ and Gaussian scale γ are tuned per model-benchmark pair; for UI-Venus-7B on ScreenSpot-Pro we use τ=1.0 and γ=2.5.

#### 4.2 Main Results

Table 3 reports results on ScreenSpot-Pro; UI-Vision and ScreenSpot-v2 results appear in Table 2 (Full results are provided in Appendix Tables 11 and 10). UI-Zoomer consistently improves all four models across all three benchmarks, with average gains of up to +13.4%, +10.3%, and +4.2% on ScreenSpot-Pro, UI-Vision, and ScreenSpot-v2 respectively.

- Table 3 Performance comparison on ScreenSpot-Pro across four models: Qwen2.5-VL-7B, GUI-G2-7B, UI-Venus-7B, and UI-Venus-72B. For a fair comparison, RegionFocus is evaluated using Qwen2.5-VL-7B as the backbone.

Zoom-in is most effective where resolution matters most. Gains are largest on ScreenSpot-Pro, the highest-resolution benchmark, and smallest on ScreenSpot-v2, which covers standard-resolution mobile and web interfaces. Within ScreenSpot-Pro, icon targets benefit more than text targets across all models (+12.5% vs. +11.1%), consistent with the intuition that compact and semantically ambiguous elements are most limited by resolution in a single forward pass.

Adaptive zoom outperforms both naive sampling and prior test-time methods. Compared to naive sampling baselines (UI-Venus-7B pass@4: 54.84%, pass@8: 58.19%), UI-Zoomer reaches 61.8% at a comparable inference budget. It also substantially outperforms the prior zoom-in method RegionFocus Luo et al. (2025) (32.1%), which applies cropping unconditionally with a fixed ratio. Against RL-trained methods, UI-Zoomer with UI-Venus-7B surpasses UI-S1-7B (30.6%) by +31.2% and GTA1-7B (50.1%) by +11.7% on ScreenSpot-Pro,

- 5 Ablation Study

We conduct systematic ablation experiments on ScreenSpot-Pro with UI-Venus-7B to validate the design of each component in UI-Zoomer.

##### Combining spatial consistency and average token confidence significantly improves the gating performance.

The gating score S combines spatial consistency Cspatial and average token confidence avg_conf. As shown in Table 5, using Cspatial alone results in 60.81% accuracy, while avg_conf alone achieves 61.10%. When both components are combined, the accuracy increases to 61.80%, demonstrating the effectiveness of their combination. The complementarity of these two signals is evident from their distributional properties: Cspatial shows a broad, spread distribution, whereas avg_conf is more concentrated (see Figure 5). This indicates that Cspatial captures spatial variability, while avg_conf focuses on token-level certainty. By combining these signals, we can more effectively discriminate between uncertain samples, leading to a more reliable gating mechanism.

Decomposing crop uncertainty into intra-sample and inter-sample variance improves crop sizing. UIZoomer decomposes crop uncertainty into intra-sample variance vintra (box extent) and inter-sample variance vinter (center disagreement across samples). As shown in Table 4, both individual terms outperform the baseline, highlighting that each term captures a distinct and useful aspect of prediction uncertainty. vintra encodes the predicted object scale, providing a lower bound on how large the crop should be, while vinter reflects cross-sample positional spread, dynamically expanding the crop when candidates disagree. Since these two sources of uncertainty are complementary and not redundant, combining them results in a more complete characterization of ambiguity, leading to the best crop sizing, achieving 61.80%.

Adaptive crop sizing provides a clear advantage over fixed-ratio alternatives. A critical design consideration is whether adaptive crop sizing offers a real benefit over simpler fixed-ratio methods. Table 8 compares fixed-ratio crops at three different scales with our Gaussian adaptive strategy. Fixed-ratio crops are sensitive

to the chosen ratio: a large ratio (0.8) retains too much background information (55.22% accuracy), while a smaller ratio (0.3) risks cutting off important contextual cues, still trailing our method (61.35% vs. 61.80%). In contrast, our Gaussian crop dynamically adjusts the crop window to the actual spread of candidate locations, achieving the best accuracy without requiring manual tuning of the crop scale.

Shifting the crop window inward yields the best performance. When the computed crop window extends beyond the image boundaries, three strategies are possible: Shrink (reduce window size), Clip (hard-clip to the image edge), or Shift (translate the window inward while preserving its size). As shown in Table 6, the Shift strategy achieves 61.80%, outperforming both Clip (60.25%) and Shrink (58.47%). Both Shrink and Clip alter the effective crop area, potentially losing important parts of the target region, whereas Shift maintains the intended crop size, preserving the spatial context needed for accurate grounding.

Retaining the top 75% of candidates yields the best accuracy. Sampled candidates can contain spatial outliers that inflate the crop window, reducing effective resolution. To mitigate this, we retain only the top-ρ fraction of candidates closest to the median center before fitting the Gaussian. As shown in Table 7, ρ = 75% achieves the best accuracy (61.80%), balancing the removal of noisy predictions (ρ = 50%: 60.37%) with the retention of all candidates, including unfiltered outliers (ρ = 100%: 60.03%).

Using a square crop improves accuracy by preserving visual context. UI elements vary widely in aspect ratio, and highly elongated crops can cause VLMs to misinterpret the spatial layout. By enforcing a square aspect ratio on the crop window, we observe a consistent improvement of +1.24 percentage points (60.56% → 61.80%, Table 9). This suggests that a compact, near-square crop better preserves the visual context needed for fine-grained grounding, leading to improved performance.

#### 5.1 Analysis

##### 5.1.1 Analysis of Gating Threshold.

To understand how the confidence-based gating threshold τ controls the trade-off between direct prediction and adaptive cropping, we ablate τ across three base models on ScreenSpot-v2, with σ = 4.5 fixed. As shown in Figure 4, where σ controls the size of the Gaussian-modeled crop window and CROP% denotes the fraction of samples routed to the zoom-in stage, we draw three key observations: (1) Moderate thresholds yield the best accuracy. When τ is too high, nearly all samples are cropped regardless of difficulty, hurting easy cases; when τ is too low, the method degenerates to the baseline. The optimal τ lies in between, selectively zooming in only when the model is uncertain. (2) Neither direct prediction nor full cropping alone is sufficient. The baseline (CROP%=0) leaves hard samples unresolved. Conversely, routing nearly all samples to the zoom-in

stage (CROP%≈100%) not only nearly doubles inference time (from ∼5:50 to ∼10:20) but also degrades accuracy below the baseline (Figure 4), suggesting that indiscriminate cropping introduces noise rather than improving localization. Our gating mechanism bridges this gap, consistently outperforming both extremes across all three models while keeping computational overhead minimal. (3) Desktop and Web benefit more than Mobile. Compared to Mobile, Desktop and Web interfaces contain denser layouts and smaller interactive elements, making them more sensitive to spatial ambiguity. UI-Zoomer’s zoom-in stage provides finer local context that is especially effective in these environments.

##### 5.1.2 Analysis of Gating Signal Reliability.

To verify that our two gating signals reliably reflect prediction confidence, we bin all ScreenSpot-Pro samples (N = 1581) by Cspatial and avg_conf respectively and measure per-bin accuracy. As shown in Figure 5, both signals show a general positive correlation with accuracy, suggesting they serve as reasonable proxies for localization reliability. Furthermore, the two signals exhibit complementary distributional characteristics: Cspatial is broadly spread while avg_conf is more concentrated, indicating that each captures a different aspect of prediction uncertainty. Their combination thus yields a more discriminative gating score, as corroborated by the ablation in Table 5.

C avg_conf

- Figure 5 Histogram distributions of Cspatial and avg_conf on ScreenSpot-Pro (N = 1581). The two signals exhibit complementary distributional characteristics, enabling a more discriminative gating mechanism when combined.

5.1.3 Analysis of Sampling Number and Temperature.

The effectiveness of UI-Zoomer hinges on the quality and diversity of the sampled candidate set, governed by sampling temperature T and rollout count N. We ablate both on ScreenSpot-Pro (Figure 3) and draw two conclusions: (1) High temperature (T=0.9) is optimal. Accuracy rises steadily from 54.46% at T=0.1 to a peak of 61.80% at T=0.9, then marginally drops at T=1.0. This suggests that GUI grounding benefits from high candidate diversity: since consensus crop estimation relies on the spatial spread of predictions, diverse candidates better cover the true target region than conservative, near-identical ones. (2) N=8 strikes the best accuracy–efficiency trade-off. Accuracy peaks at 61.80% with N=8 and slightly declines for N=12 and N=16, as additional candidates beyond this point contribute redundant or noisy predictions that corrupt the crop estimation rather than refining it. We adopt N=8 as default.

5.2 Case Studies

To better understand UI-Zoomer’s behavior beyond aggregate metrics, we visualize representative success and failure cases in Figure 6, where blue boxes denote the N stochastic candidate boxes from global multi-sampling, red highlights the zoom-in crop region, green is the ground-truth box, and yellow marks the final prediction.

In successful cases, UI-Zoomer effectively identifies the correct target despite scattered initial predictions. Even when the initial candidates are dispersed and none precisely overlap the target, UI-Zoomer leverages the spatial distribution of these proposals to identify a reliable crop region. The model then refines the prediction with a single zoom-in pass, locking onto the correct UI element. This demonstrates the method’s robustness in handling difficult cases, where initial uncertainty is high, but the model can still correctly localize the target.

In failure cases, strong visual distractors and ambiguous cues lead to incorrect predictions. These scenarios often involve multiple similar-looking icons in dense layouts, with the true target being extremely small and difficult to distinguish. In such cases, UI-Zoomer struggles to resolve the ambiguity and accurately identify the correct target, illustrating the challenges posed by highly cluttered interfaces.

- 6 Conclusion

We present UI-Zoomer, a adaptive zoom-in framework for GUI grounding that treats both the trigger and scale of zoom-in as a prediction uncertainty quantification problem. By fusing spatial consensus with token-level confidence, our reliability gate selectively routes uncertain instances to an adaptive cropping stage, where the crop window is derived from a principled variance decomposition. Extensive experiments on ScreenSpot-Pro, UI-Vision, and ScreenSpot-v2 demonstrate consistent improvements across four model architectures, with

gains of up to +13.4%, +10.3%, and +4.2%, respectively. UI-Zoomer establishes that zoom only when uncertain, and zoom by how much the predictions disagree is a simple yet effective principle for test-time scaling in GUI grounding.

### A Appendix

This appendix provides additional implementation and evaluation details to complement the main paper.

#### A.1 Prompt Template

Our experiments adopt a unified prompt template for inference, as illustrated in Figure 7. We use this prompt consistently across all experimental settings to ensure a fair comparison among different models and evaluation scenarios.

[Figure 71]

Figure 7 Complete prompt template used in our experiments.

#### A.2 Comprehensive Comparison on ScreenSpot-v2 and UI-Vision

Table 10 and Table 11 present the complete experimental results of our proposed UI-Zoomer on the ScreenSpotv2 and UI-Vision benchmarks, respectively, together with comparisons against a broad range of existing baselines. These results provide a comprehensive evaluation of our method across different models, environments, and task settings. Overall, the comparisons show that UI-Zoomer consistently improves localization performance over the corresponding base models and achieves competitive or superior results relative to existing methods, demonstrating its effectiveness and generalizability across diverse UI grounding benchmarks.

#### A.3 More Ablations

The results demonstrated in Table 12 validate the rationality of our gating mechanism: samples routed to the Gating Pass branch consistently exhibit significantly higher accuracy than those sent to the Crop branch, demonstrating that the gating score S reliably reflects prediction confidence.
