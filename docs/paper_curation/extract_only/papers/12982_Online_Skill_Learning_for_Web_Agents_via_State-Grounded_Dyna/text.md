#### Abstract

Language agents increasingly rely on reusable skills to improve multi-step web automation across related tasks. A growing line of work studies online skill learning, where agents continually induce skills from previous task trajectories and reuse them in future tasks on the fly. However, existing methods mainly reuse skills at the task-level: a fixed set of skills is retrieved based on the initial task instruction and then held fixed throughout execution. This static strategy is misaligned with web execution, where the appropriate next action depends not only on the task goal but also on the current webpage state, which often transitions into situations that the initial skills fail to cover. To address this gap, we propose StateGrounded Dynamic Retrieval (SGDR), an online skill learning method that enables stepwise skill reuse for web agents. SGDR consists of three components: a sliding-window extraction process that turns completed trajectories into reusable sub-procedures invokable at intermediate execution states, a dual text–code representation that connects skill retrieval with executable action, and a state-grounded dynamic retrieval mechanism that matches skills to both the task goal and the current webpage state. Experiments on WebArena across five domains show that SGDR consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving average success rates of 37.5% with GPT-4.1 and 24.3% with QWEN3-4B, corresponding to relative gains of 10.6% and 10.0% over the strongest baseline, respectively. The code is available at https://github.com/plusnli/skill-dyn amic-retrieval.

seeking, form filling, and forum interaction on realistic websites (Chae et al., 2025; Gu et al., 2025; Ning et al., 2025). Although these tasks vary in goals, they often share recurring procedural patterns, such as navigating menus, filling forms, applying filters, and submitting changes. This observation has motivated a growing line of work on skill learning for language agents, where reusable procedural knowledge is summarized and reused in related tasks (Liu et al., 2025; Zheng et al., 2025). By accumulating such skills, agents can amortize repeated procedural discovery and improve across related tasks without relying solely on zero-shot planning (Tack et al., 2024).

Within this direction, online skill learning provides a particularly realistic setting for web agents. Instead of assuming a fixed skill library constructed offline, online methods allow agents to continually induce skills from completed executions and update their skill library as tasks arrive sequentially (Wang et al., 2025b,a; Liu et al., 2025). Compared to relying on a pre-built library constructed offline, this online paradigm more closely matches real-world deployment, where tasks arrive sequentially and agents must improve as they go.

Despite this progress, existing online skill learn-

ing methods largely treat skill reuse as a task-level one-shot operation (Wang et al., 2025b,a; Liu et al., 2025). Skills are retrieved or injected once based on the initial task instruction and then kept fixed throughout execution. This design is natural if a web task is viewed as a static instruction, but it is insufficient for interactive web automation. In web execution, the usefulness of a skill depends not only on the task goal but also on the current webpage state. Consequently, a skill that is useful at the beginning of the task may become irrelevant later, while another skill that was not initially selected may become useful after the agent reaches a new page, form, or interaction context. The core limitation is therefore that skill retrieval operates at the task level rather than at the level of intermediate execution states, where skills actually need to be invoked. This raises a central question: how can an online agent retrieve the right reusable skill dynamically according to both the task goal and the current execution state?

However, dynamically retrieving skills at intermediate states is non-trivial, because retrieval quality depends not only on the matching mechanism but also on the granularity of the skill library. If the library contains only full-trajectory skills, retrieved procedures may preserve the complete context of their original tasks but fail to apply to arbitrary intermediate webpage states. If the library contains only single-action skills, retrieved procedures may be broadly applicable but too primitive to provide meaningful procedural abstraction. This creates a granularity challenge: state-grounded reuse requires skills that are compact enough to match diverse webpage states, yet structured enough to execute useful browser operations. Without skills at this granularity, dynamic retrieval would either return overly broad workflows that mismatch the current state or low-level actions that offer little benefit over primitive browser actions.

To address these limitations, we propose StateGrounded Dynamic Retrieval (SGDR), an online skill learning method for web agents, as illustrated in Figure 1. SGDR replaces task-level oneshot skill reuse with step-level, state-conditioned skill retrieval. After completing a task, SGDR extracts reusable sub-procedures from the trajectory through sliding-window extraction, producing skills at an intermediate granularity. Each skill is represented as a text–code pair: a natural-language description supports retrieval, while executable code provides support for action. When solving a

new task, SGDR retrieves step-specific skills conditioned on both the task instruction and the current webpage state, enabling skill support to adapt as execution unfolds. Together, these designs turn online skill learning from static task-level reuse into adaptive state-grounded reuse. Our major contributions are summarized as follows.

- • We study online skill learning for language agents under a sequential task-stream setting, where agents can only reuse skills induced from past task trajectories and update the skill library on the fly.
- • We identify the limitations of task-level one-shot skill reuse and propose state-grounded dynamic retrieval, which retrieves skills at each decision step according to both the task instruction and the evolving webpage state.
- • We enable intermediate-state skills through sliding-window extraction and dual text–code representation, producing reusable subprocedures that are both retrievable in natural language and executable as browser actions.
- • We evaluate SGDR on WebArena across five website domains with two backbone models, showing consistent overall improvements over strong online skill learning baselines in both success rates and step efficiency.

#### 2 Related Work

##### 2.1 Web Agents and Benchmarks

Early web agent research (Liu et al., 2018; Nakano et al., 2021; Yao et al., 2022) studied how language models interact with browsers to retrieve information and complete tasks in simulated environments. Recent work has scaled web agents toward more realistic settings along several axes: generalist navigation on real-world websites (Deng et al., 2023; He et al., 2024; Zheng et al., 2024a; Lai et al., 2024; Hu et al., 2025; Yu et al., 2026), robustness through memory, workflow induction, and reusable skills (Zheng et al., 2024b; Wang et al., 2024, 2025b,a; Zheng et al., 2025; Zhu et al., 2026; Sun et al., 2026), and benchmarks that evaluate agents under increasingly realistic conditions including visually grounded and conversational navigation (Zhou et al., 2024; Koh et al., 2024; Lu et al., 2024; Drouin et al., 2024; Yang et al., 2025b; Xue et al., 2025; Liu et al., 2026; Tian et al., 2025; Yang et al., 2026; Sun et al., 2025; Gou et al., 2026). Together, these efforts move web agent re-

search from controlled browser interaction toward dynamic, long-horizon web automation.

##### 2.2 Skill Discovery and Learning

Recent work explores how language agents can selfimprove by discovering and accumulating reusable skills from past executions (Qian et al., 2024; Yu

- et al., 2025; Ouyang et al., 2026a,b; Wang et al., 2026b; Tan et al., 2026b; Yang et al., 2025c; Lu
- et al., 2026; Fang et al., 2025). Early approaches store procedural knowledge in natural language and adapt it non-parametrically, such as verbal reflections (Shinn et al., 2023) or distilled experiential insights (Zhao et al., 2024). More recent work formulates reusable skills as workflows (Wang et al., 2025b), executable programs (Wang et al., 2025a), or retrievable past experiences (Liu et al., 2025), with further studies exploring diverse forms of skill organization (Zhou et al., 2025a; Zheng et al., 2025; Li et al., 2025; Tan et al., 2026a) and reuse (Wang et al., 2026c; Jiang et al., 2026; Wang et al., 2026a). Our work is complementary: rather than treating learned skills as pre-fixed memories or tools, we focus on when and how accumulated skills are retrieved and invoked, so that agents can better exploit them at the right intermediate states.

- 3 Preliminaries

###### 3.1 Task and Skill Formalization We consider a sequence of web agent tasks G =

{gi}Ni=1, where each gi denotes the natural language instruction specifying the task goal, with

a total of N tasks. When solving the i-th task gi, the agent interacts with a web environment over multiple steps, receiving the current webpage observation and executing an action, producing a trajectory Ti, which is an observation-action interleaving sequence of length Hi.

The agent maintains a skill library throughout the task sequence. We denote the skill library by Si after processing the first i tasks, with S0 being the initial empty library. Each skill s ∈ Si represents reusable procedural memory induced from previous task executions. After executing task gi, the agent may induce a set of new skills ∆Si from its trajectory and update the library as

Si = Si−1 ∪ ∆Si.

For evaluation, we use yi ∈ {0,1} to denote the ground-truth task success signal used for external benchmarking, where yi = 1 indicates that the task

is correctly solved and yi = 0 indicates that the task is not correctly solved.

##### 3.2 Online Skill Learning

Online learning is a sequential learning paradigm in which a learner makes decisions over a stream of examples and uses information revealed from previous rounds to improve future decisions (CesaBianchi and Lugosi, 2006; Shalev-Shwartz, 2025). In this work, we formulate online skill learning for language agents as a task-stream setting in which an agent solves tasks sequentially, updates its skill library from completed trajectories, and reuses only skills induced from past tasks when solving future tasks. This contrasts with offline skill learning, where a fixed skill library is pre-constructed from a separate set of tasks before being used to assist the agent on held-out evaluation tasks.

Figure 2 depicts the overall setup. In line with prior work (Wang et al., 2025a,b; Liu et al., 2025), tasks arrive sequentially: when solving task gi, the agent can only access the skill library accumulated from previous tasks, namely Si−1. The groundtruth environment signal yi for the current task is unavailable during both execution and library update, and therefore cannot be used for skill induction or action selection. The agent must complete the task using only the current instruction, the evolving webpage observations, and skills induced from past tasks. To support skill induction without access to yi, an evaluator model E is used to assess the completed trajectory after execution:

where yˆi ∈ {0,1} denotes the evaluator’s binary correctness judgment for task gi, with yˆi = 1 indicating that E judges the completed trajectory to have correctly solved the task, and yˆi = 0 indicating that E judges it to have failed.

After executing gi, the agent updates the skill library without observing the ground-truth signal yi. The update can only rely on the task instruction gi, the collected trajectory Ti, and the evaluatorproduced proxy judgment yˆi. We formalize skill induction as an update function U:

∆Si = U(gi,Ti,yˆi), Si = Si−1 ∪ ∆Si.

The newly induced skills become available only for subsequent tasks gi+1,...,gN.

The goal of online skill learning is to design an online agent that maximizes cumulative task success rates yi over the task stream:

#### 4 Proposed Method

Building on the online setting in Section 3.2, SGDR is motivated by two challenges in deploying a reusable skill library for web automation: how to extract skills at a suitable granularity and adaptively retrieve them conditioned on the evolving webpage states. To address these, SGDR combines sliding-window skill extraction with a text-code

skill representation, and state-grounded dynamic retrieval with reranking. Figure 3 illustrates the overall pipeline.

Unless otherwise specified, we describe SGDR for the current task gi in the online task stream, and omit the task index i for readability. Thus, we write the current task as g, its trajectory as T , and the currently available skill library as S = Si−1.

##### 4.1 Skill Extraction and Representation

We first describe the unit of reuse maintained by SGDR. Before solving the current task g, the agent has access only to the skill library accumulated from previous tasks, denoted as S = {sk}nk=1. Each skill sk stores a reusable web procedure and is represented as a text–code pair sk = dk,ck , where dk is a natural-language description used for retrieval and ck is an executable code function used for action execution. This text–code representation ties retrieval and execution together: the description abstracts the skill’s intent and applicable state, while the code implements the corresponding web operations once the skill is selected. For example, a description such as “navigate to the account address settings page” can be paired with code that opens the account menu, clicks the address settings entry, and waits for the target form to load.

After task g is finished, the evaluator produces a binary judgment yˆ for its completed trajectory. We perform skill extraction only when yˆ = 1, i.e., when the evaluator E judges the trajectory to have successfully solved the task. For such successful trajectories, we revisit the full trajectory T :

T = (o1,a1,o2,a2,...,aH,oH+1),

where H is the interaction horizon. At any step t ∈ {1,...,H}, ot represents the current webpage observation that the agent receives, and at denotes the executed action, forming an observation-action interleaving trajectory. In web environments, ot can be represented by the textual form of the webpage accessibility tree, which contains structured information about visible elements, their attributes, and possible interaction targets. The set of primitive actions is provided in Appendix A.1.

Rather than storing the entire trajectory as a single task-level skill, we decompose it into local segments that can be reused from intermediate states in future tasks. We then apply a set of sliding windows over the trajectory to obtain candidate segments. For each window length l ∈ L, we enumerate candidate segments

wt,l = (ot,at,...,at+l−1,ot+l),

where t ∈ {1,...,H−l+1} denotes the window’s starting timestep.

The use of sliding windows is to extract reusable skills at an intermediate granularity. Full trajectories often encode an entire task and are too specific to be reused at a later intermediate state, while individual actions are too fine-grained to capture meaningful procedures. Windowed segments instead correspond to local but reusable subroutines, such as opening a settings page, filling a short form, or applying a filter.

Each candidate segment wt,l is passed to an LLM, which judges whether it captures a reusable state-contingent procedure and, if so, converts it into a skill sk = dk,ck . Following ASI (Wang et al., 2025a), we verify each induced skill by replacing its corresponding primitive action segment in the original trajectory with a skill call and executing the rewritten trajectory in the environment. Only skills whose substituted trajectories are still judged successful by the evaluator are added to the library. Together, this sliding-window extraction and verification process yields skills that are compact enough to be invoked from intermediate execution states, while remaining executable and semantically meaningful. Once added to the library, these verified text–code skills become candidates for step-level retrieval in subsequent tasks.

##### 4.2 State-Grounded Dynamic Retrieval

Given the verified skill library, SGDR retrieves skills dynamically as the agent moves through a

task, rather than selecting a fixed set of skills only once at the beginning. At execution step t of task g, the agent observes the current web state ot. As raw web states such as accessibility trees can be verbose, we first obtain a compact state summary rt = Summarize(ot) using an LLM. The resulting summary serves as the state-side retrieval query, while the original task instruction g provides the goal-side query.

Relevance Retrieval. To retrieve appropriate skills at step t, we do relevance retrieval over the skill library S. For each skill sk = (dk,ck), we compute a combined task-state relevance score:

scoret(sk) = α cos ϕ(g),ϕ(dk)

(1)

+ (1 − α) cos ϕ(rt),ϕ(dk) .

Here ϕ(·) maps text into the embedding space, and cos(u,v) = u⊤v/(∥u∥∥v∥) denotes cosine similarity between two embeddings u and v. The coefficient α is a hyper-parameter that balances the overall task instruction and the current state. The first term measures alignment with the task goal, while the second term measures applicability to the current page state. We first keep the top-M

skills according to their relevance score scoret(sk), where M is the coarse candidate budget, and then pass them to the reranking stage described below. This stage filters the library to skills that are broadly relevant to the current task and state.

MMR Reranking. The relevance retrieval stage produces a top-M candidate set whose members are individually relevant to the current task and state. However, because skills are extracted from overlapping sliding windows, many high-scoring candidates may correspond to near-duplicate local procedures with slightly different boundaries or contexts. Directly passing the top-ranked skills to the agent can therefore allocate multiple skill slots to the same procedural pattern, leaving fewer distinct options for the next decision. To avoid this redundancy while preserving relevance, we apply Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) (Carbonell and Goldstein, 1998) within the relevance-filtered candidate set. This reranking step is not a replacement for relevance retrieval: the relevance score keeps each selected skill grounded in the current task and state, while the diversity penalty discourages selecting skills that overlap with those already chosen. Starting from an empty selected set At, we greedily add skills until |At| = 5, where each next

The second term is taken as 0 when At is empty. λ is a hyperparameter that balances relevance and coverage among selected skills. The resulting set At is the step-specific skill set activated for the agent’s next decision.

##### 4.3 Skill Injection and Execution

After retrieval and reranking, the selected set At is exposed to the agent only for the current decision step t. For each retrieved skill, we provide its description dk and callable code ck as additional action support. This step-level injection lets the available skill support adapt to the evolving webpage without exposing the full skill library at every decision step. After the task is completed, the collected trajectory is evaluated and processed by the extraction procedure illustrated in Section 4.1. The resulting verified skills are added to the corresponding domain-specific library and become available for subsequent tasks, starting from gi+1.

5 Experiments

##### 5.1 Experiment Setup

Benchmark. We evaluate on WebArena (Zhou et al., 2024), a representative and realistic web agent benchmark whose structure is well suited to our online skill learning setting. WebArena spans

five website domains, Shopping, Admin, Reddit, Gitlab, and Map, where tasks within each domain typically share similar website interface and interaction conventions. This domain structure naturally supports our domain-wise continual skill acquisition: for a given website domain, after completing a task, the agent extracts skills from the resulting trajectory and reuses them for subsequent tasks in the same domain. Since a small number of WebArena tasks require interactions across multiple websites, we exclude such tasks and focus on single-domain tasks. Accordingly, we maintain a separate skill library for each domain to avoid cross-domain interference. We list the detailed task indices within each website domain in Appendix A.2. The evaluation by WebArena environment is based on a binary success reward: the reward is 1 if the task is correctly solved, and 0 otherwise.

Baseline Methods. We compare SGDR with four baselines. Vanilla is a skill-free baseline that solves each task independently without maintaining or reusing skills across the task stream. We further compare with three baseline methods within the paradigm of online skill learning: Agent Workflow Memory (AWM) (Wang et al., 2025b), Agent Skill Induction (ASI) (Wang et al., 2025a), and Contextual Experience Replay (CER) (Liu et al., 2025). These methods can accumulate reusable memory from past trajectories and apply it to future tasks. In our comparison, they primarily instantiate task-level static reuse: relevant workflows, programmatic skills, or past experiences are selected based on the task context and then used as fixed support during execution. Specifically, AWM stores natural-language workflows, ASI induces ex-

ecutable programmatic skills, and CER retrieves relevant past experiences for decision support. For AWM and CER, we adopt their online variants, ensuring that all skill-based methods accumulate experience without access to ground-truth signals over the same task stream.

Implementation details. We report results using GPT-4.1 (Achiam et al., 2023) and QWEN34B (Yang et al., 2025a) as the backbone models. For both our method SGDR and the baselines, when using either GPT-4.1 or QWEN3-4B as the backbone LLM, we use the same model for all LLM-based components within that method, including skill induction, trajectory summarization, action planning, and evaluation. For CER, we implement the experience buffer, experience synthesis, and retrieval modules following the original paper (Liu et al., 2025). We segment the resulting trajectory with sliding windows of lengths L = {2,3,4,5} for skill extraction. During task execution, skill retrieval is performed using the stategrounded retrieval score defined in Equation (1), with α set to 0.5, followed by reranking with the MMR objective in Equation (2), where λ = 0.7. Detailed prompts and parameter configuration are given in Appendix A.3 and A.4, respectively.

5.2 Main Results

- Table 1 reports the success rates on WebArena, with step-count efficiency discussed in Section 5.3. Overall, SGDR achieves the best average success rate under both backbones, reaching 37.5% with GPT-4.1 and 24.3% with QWEN3-4B. Compared with the strongest baseline CER, SGDR improves the overall SR by 3.6 points with GPT-4.1 and

- 2.2 points with QWEN3-4B, showing that stategrounded dynamic retrieval provides benefits beyond static task-level skill reuse.

The gains are broadly distributed across domains. With GPT-4.1, SGDR achieves the best performance on four of the five domains, including a notable improvement on Admin from 41.4% to 47.7%. A similar trend holds for QWEN3-4B, while Gitlab remains the main exception. We hypothesize that Gitlab tasks often involve version-control operations with persistent repository preconditions, such as forking and merge-request operations. Since SGDR learns local rather than whole-task skills, it may be less effective for such tasks than methods that preserve complete task-level procedures.

##### 5.3 Execution Efficiency Analysis

We further examine execution efficiency through average step count. Across both backbone models, SGDR completes tasks with fewer steps than the baselines. With GPT-4.1, it uses 4.8 steps on average, compared with 6.0 for Vanilla, 5.2 for ASI, and 6.4 for CER. With QWEN3-4B, it reduces the average step count by 11.1% relative to Vanilla and 13.8% relative to CER. This efficiency gain arises because one skill can execute a short procedure composed of multiple primitive browser actions, such as a sequence of clicks and fills, thereby replacing repeated low-level interactions with a higher-level reusable action.

##### 5.4 Online Performance Analysis

A central motivation of SGDR is to improve skill reuse throughout the online task stream. Figure 4 shows the cumulative success rate with GPT-4.1 on four WebArena domains, where tasks are ordered by their original WebArena IDs and reindexed within each domain. Overall, SGDR generally stays above the baselines, with especially clear advantages on Admin and Reddit. Although the curves are not monotonic because later tasks

- Table 2: Ablation study on retrieval signals with model GPT-4.1 on Shopping, Reddit, and Map websites.

Retrieval setting Shopping Reddit Map Task-only (α = 1) 30.3 32.6 30.8 State-only (α = 0) 28.4 30.7 29.6 Task + state (α = 0.3) 32.8 34.5 31.6 Task + state (α = 0.5) 34.6 35.9 32.3 Task + state (α = 0.7) 33.4 34.1 31.2

may be harder or less aligned with previously accumulated skills, SGDR often remains on the upper envelope, suggesting that state-grounded dynamic retrieval helps the agent better exploit the growing skill library during execution. The smaller margin on Gitlab is consistent with its reliance on persistent repository-specific preconditions, which can limit the transferability of local procedural skills.

##### 5.5 Ablation Study

We conduct ablation studies with GPT-4.1 on three representative WebArena website domains: Shopping, Reddit, and Map. These studies examine three components of SGDR: relevance retrieval, MMR reranking, and skill extraction.

Ablation Study on Retrieval. We first ablate the retrieval signal to study whether the task goal, the current webpage state, or their combination is most useful for selecting skills. As shown in Table 2, task-only retrieval consistently outperforms state-only retrieval, suggesting that the initial task instruction remains an important anchor for skill selection. However, combining task and state information yields the best results across all three domains, with α = 0.5 achieving 34.6%, 35.9%, and 32.3% on Shopping, Reddit, and Map, respectively. The lower performance at α = 0.3 and α = 0.7 further indicates that overemphasizing either the current state or the task goal is suboptimal.

Ablation Study on MMR Reranking. We next ablate the MMR reranking module to examine whether relevance alone is sufficient for selecting useful skills. Table 3 shows that retrieving skills only by the top-M relevance score performs worse than all MMR variants, indicating that relevanceonly retrieval can introduce redundant or overly similar skills. Adding MMR consistently improves performance by encouraging a more diverse set of retrieved procedures. Among the MMR settings, λ = 0.7 performs best on all three domains. While other results are slightly weaker, suggesting

Reranking setting Shopping Reddit Map w/o MMR, top-M relevance 31.1 31.4 30.8 w/ MMR (λ = 0.5) 33.9 34.8 32.1 w/ MMR (λ = 0.7) 34.6 35.9 32.3 w/ MMR (λ = 0.9) 33.9 34.4 31.7

- Table 4: Ablation study on skill extraction granularity with backbone model GPT-4.1 on websites Shopping, Reddit, and Map.

Extraction setting Shopping Reddit Map Full Trajectory 31.1 32.4 28.8 Single Action 29.5 24.7 25.4 Sliding Window 34.6 35.9 32.3

that SGDR benefits most from a relevance-focused ranking that still preserves procedural diversity.

Ablation Study on Sliding-Window Extraction. We compare different granularities for skill extraction. As shown in Table 4, sliding-window skills outperform both full-trajectory and single-action alternatives on all domains. Full-trajectory skills preserve more task-level context but are less reusable for intermediate webpage states, leading to lower performance. Single-action skills perform worst because they provide little abstraction over primitive browser actions to capture meaningful procedures. In contrast, sliding-window extraction offers a better balance. It captures reusable multi-action sub-procedures while remaining flexible enough to be invoked at different execution states.

#### 6 Case Study

We present some representative case studies in Appendix B. SGDR induces reusable skills from judged-as-successful trajectories in several different domains. For example, one skill listed in Appendix B.1 fills the start and destination fields to submit a driving-directions query in the Map domain, while another skill listed in Appendix B.2 fills and submits a merge-request comment in the GitLab domain. Although the two skills come from distinct websites, both separate webpage-specific element identifiers from task-specific content values, suggesting that SGDR learns practical subprocedural patterns.

#### 7 Conclusion

We present SGDR, a method for language agents that addresses core limitations of task-level skill reuse in the setting of online skill learning. By extracting skills from sliding windows of evaluatorassessed trajectories and retrieving them dynamically with both task and state information, the agent receives adaptive support throughout execution rather than only at the beginning of each task. Results on WebArena show strong performances of SGDR across five domains with two backbone models, suggesting that state-grounded retrieval is a practical approach to improve web agents based on both proprietary and open-source models.

#### Limitations

This work still has some limitations. First, our experiments are conducted on WebArena, which provides realistic multi-step web tasks but still covers a limited set of website domains, interaction patterns, and agent action set. Evaluating SGDR on broader web environments would further validate its generality. Second, our study focuses on nonparametric skill accumulation and reuse, without exploring how the learned skills could be integrated with model fine-tuning or long-term agent personalization. We leave these directions for future work.

#### Ethical Considerations

This work studies online skill learning for language agents in web environments. Our experiments are conducted on WebArena and do not involve human subjects, private user data, or interactions with live third-party websites. Nevertheless, more capable web agents may raise potential concerns if deployed without appropriate safeguards, since automated agents could perform unintended actions, access sensitive information, or violate website usage policies. We therefore view SGDR as a research framework for controlled environments, and practical deployment should include permission checks, action constraints, and monitoring. The learned skills should also be validated before reuse in safety-critical settings.

##### A.2 Task Indices for Website Domains

For reproducibility, we provide the task indices used for each WebArena website domain. We remove all cross-site tasks to ensure that skills are extracted and reused within the same website domain, thereby preventing cross-domain skill transfer from confounding the evaluation. After this filtering, we use 764 single-domain tasks in total: 187 Shopping, 182 Admin, 106 Reddit, 180 GitLab, and 109 Map tasks. The detailed task indices for each domain are listed below.

• Shopping: 21–26, 47–51, 96, 117–118, 124– 126, 141–150, 158–167, 188–192, 225–235, 238–242, 260–264, 269–286, 298–302, 313, 319–338, 351–355, 358–362, 368, 376, 384– 388, 431–440, 465–469, 506–521, 528–532, 571–575, 585–589, 653–657, 689–693, 792– 798.

A.3 Prompts for LLM-Based Components In this subsection, we list the prompts we give to LLM-based components involved in Section 4. A.3.1 Prompts for Trajectory Assessment.

Here are the prompts we give to the trajectory evaluator model E to assess whether the current trajectory successfully complete the task, as demonstrated in both Section 3.2 and Section 4.1. They are used not only for our method, but also for other baseline methods AWM, ASI, and CER introduced in Section 5.1, as they all require the evaluator model E to judge their trajectories.

System Prompt. The system prompt requires the evaluator model E to give judgement "success" or "failure" based on the user prompt input.

You are an expert in evaluating the performance of a web navigation agent. The agent is designed to help a human user navigate a website to complete a task. Given the user's

intent, the agent's action history, the final state of the webpage, and the agent's response to the user, your goal is to decide

whether the agent's execution is successful or not.

There are three types of tasks:

1. Information seeking: The user wants to obtain

certain information from the webpage, such as the information of a product, reviews, map info, comparison of map routes, etc. The

bot's response must contain the information the user wants, or explicitly state that

the information is not available. Otherwise, e.g. the bot encounters an exception and respond with the error content, the task is

considered a failure. Besides, be careful about the sufficiency of the agent's actions

. For example, when asked to list the topsearched items in a shop, the agent should order the items by the number of searches, and then return the top items. If the ordering action is missing, the task is likely to fail.

- 2. Site navigation: The user wants to navigate to a specific page. Carefully examine the bot's action history and the final state of the webpage to determine whether the bot successfully completes the task. No need to consider the bot's response.

- 3. Content modification: The user wants to modify the content of a webpage or configuration. Carefully examine the bot's action history and the final state of the webpage to determine whether the bot successfully completes the task. No need to consider the bot's response.

*IMPORTANT* Format your response into two lines as shown

below:

Thoughts: <your thoughts and reasoning process>" Status: "success" or "failure"

User Prompt. Here is the user prompt given to the evaluator model E. For the placeholders in this prompt, intent is the task goal, last-actions is the action history of the agent, cap is the final state of the webpage, and response is the response extracted from the last action that the agent gives to the user.

|User Intent: {intent} Action History: {last-actions} The detailed final state of the webpage:<br><br>```md {cap} ```<br><br>Bot response to the user: {response if response else "N/A"}.<br><br>|
|---|

##### A.3.2 Prompts for Skill Induction.

Here we list the prompts use for skill extraction in Section 4.1. Given the trajectory windows segmented sliding windows, this skill-induction prompt extracts reusable, single-page-callable subroutines from successful trajectories and emits each as an executable Python function with a retrievalfriendly description.

##### System Prompt.

You are a proficient web-automation engineer. You judge whether short slices of a successful web trajectory are reusable sub-

routines, and when they are, you emit a small Python function that implements the routine. Follow the user instruction's rules

and output format exactly.

##### User Prompt.

You will be shown several action windows extracted from a successful web task trajectory by a sliding window of length 2, 3, 4, or 5 steps. Each step is a short thought followed by one or more action calls

(e.g. click, fill, select_option). For each window you must decide:

- 1. Is the window a *reusable* sub-routine? A reusable window:

- - Performs a recognizable web operation that could occur on other tasks (e.g. searching a

product, applying a price filter, posting a comment, opening a user profile).

- - Is general enough to apply with different inputs: variable parts (search queries, usernames, element ids that obviously vary across tasks) become function arguments with

descriptive names. Windows that depend on one-off element ids or task-specific text that cannot be parameterized are NOT reusable.

- - Contains 2 to 5 action steps. Single-page-state callability (IMPORTANT):

the agent that will invoke this skill observes only the CURRENT web page at call time. EVERY element ID the skill takes as an

argument must be readable from the single accessibility tree visible to the agent at the moment of call.

- - Strongly prefer skills whose argument IDs ( button IDs, field IDs, option IDs) are all simultaneously visible on one page state.

- - REJECT skills that require an ID which appears only AFTER a page transition the skill itself triggers. The skill may navigate internally, but the caller must still supply that future ID upfront - and the caller cannot observe pages it has not yet reached. There is NO valid exception.

- * Callable example: "fill title + fill body

+ click submit" on a single submission form

- all three IDs are visible simultaneously on that one page.

- * NOT callable: "click combobox, click option, fill title, fill body, click submit"

- the option ID only appears after the combobox is opened, so it is not readable at the moment the routine is called.

- 2. If reusable, produce:

- description: a single sentence that MUST contain both

- (a) a precise action verb + object (e.g. " submit a forum post", "apply a price filter ", "open a forum-selection combobox", "fill in the title and body"); and

- (b) the typical page context where this routine runs (e.g. "on a forum submission form", "on a product listing page", "in an opened combobox").

The description embedding is cosine-matched

to a page-state summary written in the same operational vocabulary, so generic phrasing like "Performs several clicks" will hurt

retrieval.

- code: a Python function that implements the routine.

Code constraints:

- - Use ONLY the following actions: click, fill, hover, keyboard_press, scroll, tab_focus, new_tab, tab_close, go_back, go_forward, goto, send_msg_to_user, report_infeasible, select_option.

- - Function arguments must be primitive types ( str, int, list of str). No callbacks.

- - No try / except.

- - Do NOT hardcode user-facing messages inside ` send_msg_to_user`; if the routine ends with a message, take it as a `message` argument.

Output format - return a single JSON array, one object per window in the same order they were given. Schema:

[

- {"window_idx": 0, "reusable": true, "func_name ": "search_product", "description": "...", " code": "def search_product(query):\n click('search')\n fill('search', query)\n

keyboard_press('Enter')\n"},

- {"window_idx": 1, "reusable": false}

] Only output the JSON array, no surrounding prose,

no markdown fences.

- A.3.3 Prompt for Web Summarization. Here is the prompt used for summarizing the web-

page state ri,t = Summarize(oi,t) for i-th task at execution step t, as indicated in Section 4.2. Note that it is a system prompt given to an LLM, and the user prompt is the accessibility trees (text format) of the webpage.

You are a state summarizer for a web agent whose

action library is indexed by descriptions like 'submit a forum post on a submission form' or 'apply a price filter on a product listing page'. Your summary will be cosinematched against such skill descriptions, so use the SAME operational vocabulary they do.

Given the current page's accessibility tree ( axtree) plus the URL and title, produce ONE short paragraph (1-2 sentences) that:

- 1. Names the kind of page in operational terms ( e.g. 'forum submission form', 'product listing page', 'opened forum-selection combobox', 'post-detail page with comment section').

- 2. Lists the action verbs this page ENABLES right now - i.e. what sub-routines could plausibly run on this exact state. Use verb

+ object phrasing (e.g. 'submit a post', ' select a forum', 'fill in the title and body ', 'open the sort menu', 'apply a filter').

Do NOT enumerate every visible element, do NOT describe pure visuals (colors, layout), and do NOT mention task instructions or speculate about future steps. Output only the summary text.

A.3.4 Prompt for Skill Activation and Execution.

Here is the user prompt we use to make the web agent make the next-step decision as illustrated in Section 4.3.

#### B Case Study

We present representative skills induced by SGDR from five WebArena domains: Map, GitLab, Shopping, Reddit, and Admin. These examples illustrate the form and reusability of the learned procedural knowledge across different websites and interaction patterns. In each case, the skill is extracted from a judged-as-successful trajectory and represented as a parameterized code function paired with a natural-language description.

##### B.1 Driving Directions Form Submission

The first skill is extracted from a Map task whose instruction is "Check if the social security administration in pittsburgh can be reached in one hour by car from CMU". After the task is successfully completed, SGDR induces the following skill from the trajectory:

- 1 def submit_driving_directions_form( start_field_id , dest_field_id , go_button_id , start_location , destination):

- 2 fill(start_field_id , start_location)

- 3 fill(dest_field_id , destination)

- 4 click(go_button_id) The corresponding description is given as follows.

|Fill in the starting point and destination fields and click the Go button to generate driving directions on a directions input form.<br><br>|
|---|

This skill is reusable because it separates structural webpage arguments, including start_field_id, dest_field_id, and go_button_id, from task-specific content arguments, namely start_location and destination. As a result, the same procedure can be invoked for future related map-navigation tasks when the current page satisfies the required conditions including input fields and submit button.

##### B.2 Merge Request Comment Submission

The second skill is extracted from a GitLab task whose instruction is to post “lgtm” for a merge request related to a specific project. From this successful trajectory, SGDR induces the following skill:

- 1 def submit_merge_request_comment( comment_box_id , submit_button_id , comment):

- 2 fill(comment_box_id , comment)

- 3 click(submit_button_id) Its description is:

|Submit a comment on a merge request page by filling the comment textbox and clicking the<br><br>submit button on a merge request detail view.<br><br>|
|---|

Although this skill comes from a different domain, it exhibits the same reusable abstraction pattern as the Map skill: element identifiers specify the current webpage structure, while the text argument specifies the task-dependent content.

Together, these examples show that SGDR can induce compact, parameterized skills that are

grounded in the current webpage state but remain reusable across tasks. They also illustrate why state-grounded retrieval is important: such skills are useful only when the agent reaches a page state where the required fields and buttons are visible.

##### B.3 Product Search and Wishlist Addition

The third skill is extracted from a Shopping task whose instruction is "Add Tide PODS Spring Meadow Scent HE Turbo Laundry Detergent Pacs, 81 Count to my wish list". After the task is successfully completed, SGDR induces the following skill from the trajectory:

- 1 def search_and_add_first_product_to

- 2 _wishlist(search_box_id , search_button_id , add_to_wishlist_button_id , product_query):

- 3 fill(search_box_id , product_query)

- 4 click(search_button_id)

- 5 click(add_to_wishlist_button_id) The corresponding description is given as follows.

|Search for a product and add the first search result to the wish list on a product search results page.<br><br>|
|---|

This skill captures a longer e-commerce subroutine that combines product search, query submission, and wishlist addition. It separates the task-specific content argument product_query from structural webpage arguments, including search_box_id, search_button_id, and add_to_wishlist_button_id. Compared with simpler two-step fill-and-submit skills, this example shows that SGDR can induce multi-step reusable procedures that abstract over repeated shopping interactions.

##### B.4 Comment Reply Submission

The fourth skill is extracted from a Reddit task whose instruction is "Reply to the manager of the website in this post with ’thanks! I am a big fan of your website.’". After the task is successfully completed, SGDR induces the following skill from the trajectory:

- 1 def submit_comment_reply(reply_box_id , post_button_id , message):

- 2 fill(reply_box_id , message)

- 3 click(post_button_id) The corresponding description is given as follows.

|Fill in a reply message and submit it using the reply textbox and post button on a comment thread page.<br><br>|
|---|

This skill represents a common social-forum interaction, where the agent fills a reply textbox and submits the response. It separates the taskspecific reply content message from structural webpage arguments, including reply_box_id and post_button_id. Together with the GitLab merge-request comment skill, this example shows that similar fill-and-submit procedural patterns can emerge across different domains, such as forum discussion and code collaboration. B.5 Shipping Carrier Selection

The fifth skill is extracted from an Admin task whose instruction is "Update order #306 with the UPS tracking number 55591023930". After the task is successfully completed, SGDR induces the following skill from the trajectory:

- 1 def add_tracking_carrier( add_tracking_btn_id , carrier_dropdown_id , carrier_name):

- 2 click(add_tracking_btn_id)

- 3 select_option(carrier_dropdown_id , carrier_name)

The corresponding description is given as follows.

|Select a shipping carrier from a dropdown after clicking the 'Add Tracking Number' button in<br><br>the Shipping Information section on an order details page.<br><br>|
|---|

This skill captures an order-management operation in the Admin domain. Unlike the previous examples that mainly rely on fill and click, this skill uses select_option to choose a shipping carrier from a dropdown menu after expanding the tracking-number interface. It separates the task-specific carrier argument carrier_name from structural webpage arguments, including add_tracking_btn_id and carrier_dropdown_id, showing that SGDR can induce reusable skills over different primitive action types.

Overall, these case studies show that SGDR learns compact procedural skills across all five WebArena domains. The induced skills consistently separate webpage-specific structural arguments from task-specific content arguments, making them both grounded in the current page state and reusable for future tasks. They also cover diverse interaction patterns, including form submission, comment posting, product search, wishlist addition, and dropdown selection.
