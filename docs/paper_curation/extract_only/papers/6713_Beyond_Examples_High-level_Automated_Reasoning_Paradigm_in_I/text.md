## Abstract

In-context learning (ICL) enables large language models (LLMs) to perform downstream tasks through advanced prompting and high-quality demonstrations. However, traditional ICL paradigms encounter significant limitations in complex reasoning tasks, stemming primarily from their dependence on example quality and absence of explicit reasoning guidance. To address these challenges, we introduce HiAR-ICL, a High-level Automated Reasoning paradigm in ICL that shifts focus from specific examples to abstract reasoning patterns, thereby extending the conventional concept of “context” in ICL. Our approach begins by defining five atomic reasoning actions, upon which we employ Monte Carlo Tree Search to systematically construct high-level reasoning patterns. During inference, HiAR-ICL dynamically selects appropriate reasoning patterns based on problem attributes, providing explicit guidance for the model’s reasoning process. Experiments demonstrate HiAR-ICL’s effectiveness and efficiency: utilizing only 200 prior samples with Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, our method achieves 80.6% accuracy on MATH and 62.5% on AMC, exceeding GPT-4o’s 77.2% and 57.5%. Our approach enhances performance across models of varying sizes while generalizing effectively across domains. Further analysis reveals that HiAR-ICL can also serve as a plug-and-play inference method compatible with post-training techniques like GRPO.

## 1 Introduction

“Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime.”

— An old proverb

Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse tasks and domains [1–3]. Their proficiency in complex reasoning, particularly in mathematical tasks, has emerged as a critical benchmark for evaluating fundamental cognitive abilities [4–6]. Mastering multi-step reasoning capabilities requires rigorous adherence to intricate rules and sophisticated problem-solving strategies, presenting significant challenges for existing LLMs [7, 8].

In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a promising approach for enhancing LLMs’ reasoning capabilities, distinguished by its simplicity and parameter-free nature [9]. Rooted in analogy-based learning [10], ICL strategically employs curated demonstration examples to help models uncover latent patterns and generate sophisticated reasoning trajectories. Recent research has focused on

Figure 1: We compare HiAR-ICL with traditional zero-shot and few-shot in-context learning methods using a teacher-student paradigm. (a) Direct Prompting (Zero-shot CoT) provides a generic “Let’s think step by step” instruction, which is insufficient for detailed step-by-step reasoning; (b) Few-shot In-Context Learning offers carefully selected examples but struggles with dissimilar problems; (c) Our method teaches high-level reasoning patterns, ensuring robust performance across various problems.

improving ICL performance through advanced prompt engineering, including instruction optimization [11] and demonstration selection [12]. A key advancement is Chain-of-Thought (CoT) [13], which uses prompts like “Let’s think step by step” to facilitate more structured problem-solving [14].

Despite recent advances, current ICL paradigms face three critical limitations: (1) Empirical studies [15–18] reveal that LLMs’ reasoning performance is highly sensitive to demonstration characteristics such as quantity, ordering, and label distributions. Suboptimal examples can impede reasoning abilities, often requiring considerable human curation; (2) existing ICL methods lack explicit guidance signals, forcing LLMs to infer implicit cues through imitation [19]; and (3) ICL’s generalization capacity remains constrained. Reconstructing examples becomes necessary when encountering tasks with similar logical structures but different presentation formats [20].

To address these challenges, we propose HiAR-ICL, a High-level Automated Reasoning paradigm in ICL through Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). Our approach extends traditional ICL by redefining “context” from mere examples to higher-order cognitive reasoning patterns. This paradigm embodies the intuitive principle of “teaching how to think, rather than what to think”. Figure 1 illustrates the core concepts of our method and traditional ICL approaches within a teacher-student paradigm.

Specifically, our method comprises two key steps: (1) MCTS-powered thought card construction, and (2) adaptive reasoning and verification. First, we define five atomic reasoning actions as the fundamental building blocks of chain-structured reasoning patterns (termed "thought cards" that serve as reference guidance during inference). Leveraging these actions and a small set of seed data, we apply MCTS to automatically derive high-level reasoning patterns, constructing multiple thought cards that capture diverse reasoning strategies. Second, during inference, we adaptively select thought cards based on problem characteristics and guide the model’s reasoning process accordingly. This step incorporates verification through process reward modeling and self-consistency checks to validate the final solution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HiAR-ICL significantly outperforms traditional ICL methods across diverse tasks and domains, even achieving comparable results to powerful closed-source models like GPT-4o with a 7B backbone. Our main contributions are:

- • Novel ICL Insight: We transcend traditional ICL by extending “context” from specific examples to abstract (higher-level) reasoning patterns, advancing the frontier of ICL research.
- • Automated Adaptive Reasoning Paradigm: We propose an MCTS-powered framework that automatically generates diverse reasoning patterns and adaptively applies them based on problem characteristics, enabling robust reasoning performance and cross-domain generalization.
- • Remarkable Performance and Efficiency: HiAR-ICL achieves 80.6% accuracy on MATH and 62.5% on AMC with Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, surpassing GPT-4o (77.2% and 57.5%), while reducing time cost by approximately 10× compared to leading test-time inference methods.

Overview of HiAR-ICL This section introduces HiAR-ICL in detail. As shown in Figure 2, our approach consists of two main components:

- • MCTS-powered Thought Card Construction: Leverage MCTS to systematically construct highlevel thought cards, which effectively guides subsequent problem-solving.
- • Adaptive Reasoning and Verification: Dynamically select and execute optimal reasoning patterns based on the problem’s cognitive complexity, followed by solution verification.

### 2.1 MCTS-powered Thought Card Construction

Understanding human complex reasoning is crucial for modeling cognitive processes [21]. Existing studies distinguish between two cognitive systems: System 1 and System 2 [22, 23]. While “System 1” represents fast, intuitive, yet error-prone thinking, “System 2” involves slow, deliberative thinking with superior performance. With the emergence of advanced models like OpenAI’s o1, developing efficient “System 2” approaches to emulate human cognitive processes has gained significant research attention [24, 25]. Inspired by this, we introduce five atomic human-like reasoning actions to bridge the gap between model reasoning and human cognition: System Analysis (SA, a1), One-Step Thought (OST, a2), Chain-of-Thought (CoT, a3), Divide and Conquer (DC, a4), Self-Reflection and Refinement (SRR, a5). Detailed descriptions are provided in Appendix C.1.

Following the action definition, we introduce “thought cards”, which serve as structured reasoning templates to guide subsequent inference in Section 2.2. Using a small seed dataset, we derive reasoning paths (Phase 1) and distill them into multiple thought cards (Phase 2). These cards serve as prior insights for testing stage, facilitating efficient adaptive reasoning.

- Phase 1: Acquire reasoning paths for seed data As shown in Figure 2, we employ MCTS to iteratively optimize the solution search process, generating high-quality reasoning paths for the seed dataset. This design combines MCTS’s iterative nature with LLMs’ inherent reasoning capabilities, leading to enhanced search outcomes [26, 27]. Following previous studies [28, 29], we formulate each complex reasoning question q as a tree search problem, where q represents the root node and subsequent nodes denote reasoning steps (actions and corresponding outcomes) generated by a policy LLM πθ. We define the state St−1 as the trajectory q,s1,...,st−1, where S0 = q. The next step is sampled as st ∼ πθ(St−1). To guide tree expansion, we define Q(s) as the reward value for node s. Initially, all unexplored nodes are assigned Q(si) = 0. They are updated using a weighted average

between the parent’s current value and its child node’s value:

Q(p) ← (1 − α)Q(p) + αQ(s) (1) where α is a discount factor for future rewards. For terminal nodes, following prior work [29], we adopt the likelihood (confidence) of self-consistency majority voting as the reward value, enabling supervision-free generalization. Specifically, this step comprises four MCTS operations:

- (1) Selection. This operation identifies optimal nodes for expansion. Starting from the root node, a child node is chosen at each tree level until reaching a leaf node, defined as achieving maximum tree depth or arriving at an answer here. To balance the exploration and exploitation, we employ the well-known Upper Confidence Bounds applied to Trees (UCT) [30] for node selection:

UCT(s) = Q(s) + w

lnN(p) N(s)

(2)

where Q(s) is the reward value for node s, N(s) is the visit count, p is the parent node, and w is the exploration weight. The node with the highest UCT value is selected for subsequent phases, balancing exploration and exploitation.

- (2) Expansion. The selected node s is expanded by sampling n actions from πθ and generating corresponding reasoning outcomes. These n child nodes are then added to the tree.
- (3) Simulation. Starting from the selected node, we iteratively sample and expand nodes until reaching a terminal state (maximum depth or final answer node). To enhance efficiency, we implement an early termination strategy based on self-consistency [31]. This strategy exploits the observation that repeatedly sampled actions at the same state likely indicate successful task completion. If the model’s consistency score exceeds a threshold c, i.e., SC(s) > c, the simulation terminates early.
- (4) Backpropagation. Upon simulation completion, node information is updated along the simulation

path s0,...sd. Visit counts are incremented (N(s) ← N(s) + 1), and node value Q(s) is propagated backward to its parent node p using Equation 1.

- Phase 2: Distill paths into thought cards After executing MCTS, we obtain a tree structure for each seed dataset question, yielding multiple valid reasoning paths. To identify the optimal reasoning trajectory, we draw inspiration from the concept of Value of Computation (VOC) [32]. VOC posits that intelligent systems should optimize the trade-off between computational benefits and costs. Accordingly, we propose a novel VOC-inspired selection metric:

Score(q,pq) = k · R(pq|q) − (1 − k) · C(pq) (3) where q is the task input, pq denotes a candidate reasoning path, and k balances benefits against computational costs. Here, R(pq|x) denotes the path’s final reward (defined as the leaf node’s Q-value), while C(pq) is the reasoning cost (defined as the number of actions in the sequence).

For each question in the seed dataset, we select the optimal path pbest with the highest Score(q,pq) to build a Question-path repository D with one-to-one mappings. Inspired by metareasoning principles [32, 33], which advocate for adaptive reasoning strategies, we distill these question-path pairs into abstract thought cards C that represent high-level reasoning patterns abstracted from similar problems. This transformation is guided by three cognitive complexity indicators [34]: (1) Subquestion Count (SC): The number of decomposed subproblems required to solve question q; (2) Problem Condition Complexity (PCC): The number of prior known conditions in q; and (3) Problem Semantics (PS): The semantic representation derived from the q’s linguistic features. Finally, each card contains a high-level thought template (e.g., SA → OST → CoT), along with the average SC, PCC, and PS metrics of questions sharing this template. In this paper, we utilize PCC as our default metric, with SC and PS serving as optional criteria. More complex designs are left for future work.

### 2.2 Adaptive Reasoning and Verification

Adaptive Reasoning During inference, for a test question qt, we compute its SC, PCC, and PS metrics using Llama3-8B-Instruct. We then perform nearest neighbor matching [35] against preconstructed thought cards C to identify the most relevant cards that best align with the question’s attributes. These chosen cards serve as reference templates for qt in the final solution generation and verification. This selection process is formalized as:

c∈Cqtd(qt,c) (4)

NN5(qt,C) = arg min

Cqt⊆C,|Cqt|=5

where NN5(qt,C) ⊆ C denotes the five most relevant thought cards, determined by the distance function d. We employ distinct distance metrics for each attribute: absolute difference (e.g.,

|PCCqt − PCCc|) for SC and PCC, and cosine similarity between the semantic representations of qt and each card’s associated questions. These selected cards serve as high-level reasoning templates. Following these templates, the model systematically breaks down the reasoning process into sequential steps, with each step corresponding to a specific atomic action.

Verification To identify the most accurate solution among candidates [36, 29, 37], we introduce a simple yet effective two-stage verification method. We first apply process-supervision scoring to evaluate each reasoning path. The top-3 highest-scoring paths then undergo self-consistency checks to determine the final solution. Our experiments confirm that even straightforward self-consistency checks can effectively identify precise reasoning chains without additional supervision.

## 3 Experimental Settings

Datasets We conduct experiments across multiple reasoning tasks. We use 200 randomly sampled training instances as seed data for thought card construction (Section 2.1), with evaluation on corresponding test sets: (1) arithmetic reasoning: GSM8K1319 [38] and SVAMP300 [39]; (2) mathematical reasoning: MATH500 [40] and AMC40 [41]; (3) commonsense reasoning: StrategyQA687 [42]; (4) PHD-level Scientific Reasoning: GPQADiamond198 [43]. While Table 1 presents results across all datasets, our subsequent analysis mainly focus on MATH, GSM8K, SVAMP, and StrategyQA to enable direct comparisons with baselines that lack results on the challenging AMC and GPQA.

Baselines We evaluate HiAR-ICL against three strong baseline categories: (1) traditional examplebased ICL methods, including zero-shot CoT [44], few-shot CoT [13], and CoT+SC [31]; (2) tree-based methods, including ToT [45], RAP [4], ReST-MCTS* [37], LLaMA-Berry [46], and rStar [29]. (3) leading LLMs, including Llama3.1-405B [47], and GPT-4o [48], and Claude-3.5 [49]. We provide more baseline comparisons like the advanced Reinforced ICL [50] in Appendix E.1.

Evaluation Metrics We evaluate our approach using two metrics: accuracy, based on the strict matching between the model’s final answer and ground truth, and average time cost per sample to assess computational efficiency compared to existing leading search-based approaches.

Implementation Details We use the vLLM framework2 with parameters: temperature 0.8, top-p 0.9, top-k 40, repetition penalty 1.0, and max tokens 1024. For MCTS implementation, we set the maximum tree depth dmax to 5, exploration weight w to 2.0, and prediction terminal threshold c to 0.90. In the VOC-based optimal path selection (Sec. 2.1), we use a balance factor k of 0.95. All experiments are conducted on a Ubuntu 22.04 machine equipped with NVIDIA A100-80GB GPUs.

## 4 Results and Discussion

This section validates the effectiveness of HiAR-ICL from four aspects: 4.1 performance, 4.2 computational efficiency, 4.3 out-of-distribution generalization, 4.4 weak-to-strong generalization, and 4.5 ablation studies and analysis.

### 4.1 Performance Comparison with Baselines

Results on Diverse Reasoning Benchmarks Table 1 presents the performance of HiAR-ICL across four mainstream reasoning benchmarks. We have three key findings:

♢ HiAR-ICL consistently outperforms traditional ICL methods across models. For example, Llama38B-Instruct’s accuracy on MATH improved from 17.8% (few-shot CoT) to 46.6% (HiAR-ICL), a 2.6× improvement. Similarly, on AMC, performance increased from 7.5% (few-shot CoT) to 30% (HiAR-ICL), demonstrating the substantial potential of our approach.

♢ The consistent performance gains across diverse reasoning tasks of different domains and varying difficulty levels further validate the generalizability of our high-level reasoning patterns. HiAR-ICL demonstrates robust improvements in arithmetic reasoning (GSM8K, SVAMP), mathematical reasoning (MATH, AMC), commonsense reasoning (StrategyQA), and PhD-level scientific knowledge

reasoning (GPQADiamond). This cross-task effectiveness suggests that the high-level reasoning patterns transcend specific domain boundaries and difficulty levels.

♢ Our approach yields substantial improvements on small models, with Qwen2-7BInstruct increasing from 52.9% to 66.8% and Yi-1.5-6B-chat from 40.5% to 57.4% on MATH. Similar enhancements are observed on PhD-level GPQADiamond and olympiadlevel AMC. These results highlight HiARICL’s potential for boosting the reasoning capabilities of small models.

Comparison with Powerful LLMs We further investigate HiAR-ICL’s performance upper bound when integrated with smaller models compared to larger models. As shown in Figure 3, the 7B Qwen2.5 model achieves 80.6% accuracy on the challenging MATH benchmark, outperforming few-shot GPT-4o (77.2%). Similarly, Yi-1.5-6B+HiAR-ICL surpasses Yi-1.5-34B when employing our reasoning paradigm. This indicates that HiAR-ICL-empowered small models have the potential to exceed much larger models. In other words, while traditional ICL provides specific examples, our approach offers high-level problem-solving thought patterns that equip smaller models with problem decomposition capabilities typically found in larger models, thereby enabling superior performance. Detailed results are provided in Appendix Table 11.

Comparison with Tree-based Methods We compare our method HiAR-ICL with other powerful tree-based reasoning methods in Table 2. While existing methods like ToT and RAP face significant

challenges, our method demonstrates superior performance and notable generalization across various models and datasets. The performance gap widens with increasing reasoning complexity from GSM8K to MATH. Specifically, for Llama3-8B-Instruct, our method achieves 46.6% accuracy compared to the best baseline’s 42.9%. Similarly for Qwen2-7B-Instruct, it improves from 53.3% to 66.8%. While traditional tree search methods provide broad exploration capabilities and performance upper bound, they struggle to identify precise reasoning paths, particularly for complex reasoning tasks. Our approach addresses this limitation by leveraging prior thought cards to effectively guide reasoning based on problem attributes. Detailed results are described in Appendix Table 11.

- 4.2 Computational Efficiency

We further compare HiAR-ICL with rStar [29], a recently proposed method that significantly expands the solution search space and achieves leading performance in tree-based reasoning. Our analysis in Figure 4 systematically assesses both performance and computational efficiency. HiAR-ICL achieves competitive performance with rStar while substantially reducing computational overhead. For rigor comparison, we note that the total time cost per sample includes both offline card construction time and online inference time, representing the comprehensive “end-to-end” time cost per sample for our approach. Detailed descriptions of time cost calculations are provided in Appendix E.6.

Specifically, HiAR-ICL achieves substantial time reductions of 21.8× on GSM8K and 21.0× on StrategyQA through adaptive pattern selection. On the more challenging MATH dataset, our method maintains a 7.0× speedup. These efficiency gains are primarily attributed to the efficient online inference that adaptively selects appropriate reasoning patterns rather than exhaustively searching the solution space for each problem. This demonstrates HiAR-ICL’s ability to balance performance and efficiency across problems of varying complexity.

- 4.3 Out-of-Distribution Generalization

Recent studies have highlighted the critical impact of distributional bias on LLMs’ reliability [54, 55]. Despite impressive in-distribution (ID) performance, these models substantially underperform when

confronted with out-of-distribution (OOD) data [56]. This challenge is compounded by the inherent difficulty of acquiring sufficient training data.

In this paper, we evaluate HiAR-ICL’s performance against in-context learning (ICL) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) under OOD scenarios. To ensure a fair comparison, we use the same 200 seed samples for both thought card construction and SFT. As illustrated in Figure 5, while ICL and SFT experience significant performance degradation, HiAR-ICL demonstrates remarkable resilience, preserving robust performance across multiple models and datasets. These results underscore HiARICL’s superior robustness and generalization capabilities, positioning it as a more reliable and adaptable solution for handling diverse reasoning tasks, including both ID and OOD data.

### 4.4 Weak-to-Strong Generalization

As described in prior work [57], interactions between weak and strong models can be categorized into two primary paradigms: 1) knowledge distillation, which involves transferring capabilities or knowledge from strong models to weak models; and 2) weak-to-strong improvement, where models with limited capabilities can effectively guide the development of more advanced models. Given that knowledge distillation has been extensively studied in previous research [58], we focus here on HiAR-ICL’s potential for weak-to-strong generalization.

Table 3: Weak-to-strong generalization results. ‘CoT’ denotes direct CoT reasoning by the strong model, while ‘HiAR-ICL’ represents our approach where weaker models (left →) construct thought cards that serve as reasoning guidelines for strong model (→ right) inference.

- HiAR-ICL 80.0 95.8 92.7 75.7

In our experimental setup, we leverage a weaker model (e.g., Llama2-7B) to construct thought cards that serve as reasoning guidelines for stronger models (e.g., GPT-4o), establishing a weak-to-strong generalization framework. Table 3 presents comprehensive results across different model configurations. In weak-to-strong scenarios, our method consistently outperforms CoT baselines, achieving superior performance across all evaluated tasks. Notably, the Llama2-7B model effectively guides GPT-4o, improving performance on MATH (79.6% vs. 77.2%) and GSM8K (95.0% vs. 94.3%). When using Llama2-7B to guide Qwen2.5-7B and Qwen2.5-14B, we obtain significant performance improvements, especially on the challenging MATH and StrategyQA datasets. These results demonstrate that structured reasoning patterns extracted by weaker models can substantially enhance stronger models’ performance, offering a promising direction for scenarios where powerful teacher models are unavailable.

### 4.5 Ablation Studies and Analysis

Effect of Thought Cards HiAR-ICL constructs thought cards to provide high-level reasoning patterns during inference. As shown in Table 4 (Row 2), replacing structured thought cards with random action-based reasoning chains (path lengths 2-5) results in a 10.4% accuracy drop, highlighting the importance of precise prior reasoning patterns.

Effect of Cognitive Complexity Framework Given pre-constructed thought cards, if the cards are not matched based on question complexity but are instead randomly selected as guiding information, we observe a performance drop of 5.0% in Table 4 (Rows 3). This indicates that matching thought cards to the complexity of the question is crucial for optimal performance.

Effect of Verification Module We evaluate four verification configurations: random solution selection, Self-Consistency (SC), Process Reward Model (PRM), and our combined approach (SC+PRM). Table 4 (Rows 6-8) demonstrates that path selection significantly impacts performance, with SC+PRM (our default in HiAR-ICL) achieving optimal results. While SC also performs well, even random selection shows only a 4.8% accuracy drop, indicating that our preliminary inference generates high-quality candidate solutions and confirming the effectiveness of earlier modules.

Test-time Scaling Law in Reasoning Tasks To investigate whether our method follows test-time scaling laws, we gradually increase the number of selected thought cards during inference. As shown

Table 4: Ablation results on Llama3-8B-Instruct. We report the performance after removing or replacing each component of HiAR-ICL. All modules prove essential for optimal performance.

- Figure 6: Test-time scaling law performance. We examine the variation in HiAR-ICL performance with the number of selected reasoning guidance-providing thought cards in Section 2.2.

in Figure 6, progressively adding more reasoning guidance-providing thought cards consistently improves performance for our HiAR-ICL approach. However, it is important to note that this increase in thought cards also brings about additional computational overhead. Therefore, finding an optimal balance between performance and cost becomes a key direction for future research and optimization.

Plug-and-Play Capability Similar to ICL methods like CoT, HiAR-ICL operates as a training-free test-time inference framework compatible with post-training techniques. We demonstrated this by applying HiAR-ICL to models that have undergone GRPO training on the MATH training set. Table 5 shows that our framework consistently enhances performance when integrated with these approaches. This synergy suggests HiAR-ICL captures reasoning patterns complementary to those acquired during post-training, affirming its plug-and-play versatility. Our comprehensive results in Tables 1, 5, and 14 further demonstrate HiAR-ICL’s broad applicability across various model architectures and training paradigms, including base, instruction-tuned, and reinforcement learning-optimized models. This also demonstrates the generalizability and versatility of high-level thought patterns in complex reasoning tasks. Future work could explore deeper integration with post-training methods to maximize complementary benefits [59, 60].

## 5 Related Work

In-Context Learning via Examples In-context learning enables LLMs to implicitly learn reasoning strategies from few demonstrations without parameter updates [9, 20]. Existing approaches like CoT [13] guide step-by-step reasoning through instructions like “Let’s think step by step” with several high-quality examples, while self-consistency [31] improves performance by generating and

aggregating multiple reasoning paths. However, these methods predominantly rely on example-level analogical learning, which exhibits limited generalization capabilities and often necessitates expert intervention for complex reasoning tasks [15, 19, 61, 62]. In contrast, our approach shifts the focus from specific examples to high-level reasoning patterns, enabling automated, adaptive, and efficient inference across diverse complex reasoning tasks without human intervention. Notably, this paradigm synergizes LLMs’ implicit reasoning capabilities with explicit external guidelines, facilitating strong performance even with relatively compact models under 10B parameters.

Tree-based Search LLMs exhibit impressive capabilities but face challenges in complex reasoning tasks [1]. Tree search algorithms like MCTS [63] have emerged as powerful tools to expand search spaces and enhance reasoning capabilities [64, 27]. Recent approaches such as Tree of Thought [45] and Graph of Thought [65] explore non-linear reasoning paths through multiple LLM queries. While advanced methods like AlphaMath [66] and rStar [29] advance reasoning capabilities, they often incur significant computational overhead. In contrast, our approach introduces a novel paradigm that strategically frontloads computational resources and incorporate prior reasoning patterns, achieving competitive performance with significant higher efficiency.

## 6 Conclusion

We propose HiAR-ICL, a novel MCTS-powered reasoning paradigm that enhances in-context learning by integrating abstract reasoning patterns. Unlike conventional approaches that rely solely on examplebased learning, HiAR-ICL leverages adaptive, explicit, and structured reasoning strategies, enabling LLMs to move beyond imitation toward developing genuine reasoning capabilities. This paradigm demonstrates significant performance improvements on complex reasoning tasks across multiple domains, highlighting its potential to advance efficient reasoning in LLMs. This work provides detailed empirical foundations for future research on scalable and efficient reasoning frameworks in LLMs, and opens promising directions for investigating how high-level problem-solving reasoning patterns can be automatically abstracted and applied across broader tasks and domains.

## A Further Discussions on HiAR-ICL and In-Context Learning

In this work, we introduce HiAR-ICL, a novel paradigm within the broader in-context learning (ICL) framework. Originally proposed by prior work [10], ICL refers to a process where the model is provided with natural language instructions and/or task examples and is expected to complete new task instances by predicting subsequent content. Our proposed HiAR-ICL paradigm maintains alignment with this foundational definition while extending its scope through two main dimensions:

Paradigm Adherence: Although HiAR-ICL introduces a distinct pre-computation phase through MCTS to systematically construct high-level reasoning patterns (termed “thought cards”), the paradigm fundamentally remains within the ICL framework. During inference, HiAR-ICL leverages these generated reasoning patterns explicitly formulated as natural language instructions. This approach retains the core mechanism of guiding the model via linguistic context, thus adhering strictly to the traditional conceptualization of ICL despite the augmented preparatory step.

Context Redefinition: We significantly expand the conventional interpretation of “context” within ICL. Traditionally, “context” refers strictly to task-specific demonstration examples. In contrast, HiAR-ICL shifts the focus from concrete example-driven contexts to more abstract, generalized reasoning patterns. This redefinition allows context to transcend task-specific boundaries, enabling models to generalize reasoning strategies effectively across diverse domains and tasks. Consequently, our broader definition enhances cross-task adaptability, significantly enriching the concept of context originally outlined by prior work [10].

By redefining context from example-specific instances to higher-level reasoning abstractions, HiARICL provides a robust, generalizable foundation for enhancing LLM performance, especially on complex reasoning tasks. This paradigm extension paves the way for future research that explores richer, more flexible contexts, facilitating stronger generalization capabilities across various problemsolving scenarios.

### B.2 LLM Reasoning

LLMs have shown impressive performance across various reasoning tasks [1], including mathematical [8] and commonsense reasoning [42]. Appropriate reasoning methods can substantially enhance LLM problem-solving capabilities, potentially transforming small models into powerful problem-solvers [7, 29]. Given a policy model, πθ (an autoregressive pre-trained LLM) and an input problem x, π can autogressive generate an output sequence output = (s0,s1,s2,...,sT) by predicting the next token, where s0 := x and ansp = sT. Each output sequence (s0,s1,s2,...,sT) is termed a reasoning trajectory traj. The conditional probability distribution of generating the complete reasoning trajectory is:

π(traj | x) =

T

π (st | x,s<t) (5)

t=1

Following prior works [4, 29], we can conceptualize LLMs as world models, with the complex reasoning process formulated as a Markov decision process. Specifically, when addressing complex reasoning challenges in real-world scenarios, at each time step t, the model receives a state St−1, comprising the original input problem x and preceding reasoning steps (s0,s1,s2,...,st−1). The policy model πθ then generates the current action at = πθ(Φ(St−1)), which prompts the LLM to produce the next reasoning step st. The entire process, from the initial step s0 to the final output sT, naturally forms a complete trajectory or chain of thought.

Recent research has focused on developing diverse methods to enhance LLMs’ reasoning capabilities, including zero-shot prompting, few-shot prompting, chain-of-thought (CoT), tree-of-thought (ToT), and Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS). These approaches aim to improve overall performance through the following formulation:

0,s1,···,sT)∼Pπ(traj|x) [P (yp = yg | s0,s1,··· ,sT,x)] (6)

Pπ (yp = yg | Q) = E(s

where P (yp = yg | s0,s1,··· ,sT,x) represents the probability of obtaining an accurate final answer given the problem x and reasoning trajectory traj.

### B.3 In-Context Learning

Originally introduced by previous study [10], in-context learning (ICL) can be described as “A process where the model is provided with natural language instructions and/or a few examples of a task, and is then expected to complete additional instances of that task simply by predicting what should come next.” For a task τD, it typically involves two key components: a demonstration example space D and a joint probability distribution P(X,Y ) [9]. The task demonstration D = (xi,yi)ni=1 contains n example pairs sampled from the joint distribution. These pairs typically consist of a problem x and the corresponding solution trajectory traj. Therefore, the ICL-based reasoning process can be formally expressed as:

D ∼ P(X,Y ), yp = πθ(D,x)

(7)

Extensive research has focused on constructing high-quality examples and enriching the demonstration space D [12, 9]. For example, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning [13, 44] incorporates prompts like "Let’s think step by step" alongside step-by-step reasoning examples, allowing models to emulate human-like reasoning and achieve success in complex problem-solving [14]. Self-Consistency [31] further enhances performance by generating multiple reasoning paths and selecting the most consistent answer. Prompt Space [17] optimizes prompt engineering for better example-based analogy. Many-Shot ICL [50] enhances performance by scaling sample quantity, which requires substantial context-processing capabilities and computational overhead. Increasing sample volume may even degrade performance by overwhelming model capacity [67].

However, this traditional ICL paradigm primarily emphasizes example-level analogical learning, with performance constrained by the selection of demonstrations. This typically necessitates human expert intervention for complex reasoning tasks [15, 19]. In contrast, our approach shifts the focus from specific examples to high-level reasoning patterns, expanding the concept of context. This shift

improves generalization, enabling fully automated, efficient inference without human intervention, even for models with fewer than 10 billion parameters. The most relevant prior work is Bufferof-Thought (BoT) [61], which designs thought templates for tasks by retrieving relevant templates to prompt LLMs. However, BoT has several limitations: (1) it relies heavily on large models like GPT-4 for template generation, (2) exhibits limited generalization to novel tasks, and (3) lacks structured reasoning mechanisms. Our approach addresses these limitations by (1) automatically constructing reasoning paths through Monte Carlo Tree Search, (2) adaptively selecting paths based on problem complexity, and (3) integrating structured reasoning processes. Notably, our framework operates entirely with smaller models while maintaining robust performance, offering both enhanced generalization and efficiency.

## C Algorithm Details

Overview As shown in Figure 2, HiAR-ICL consists of two components: 1) MCTS-powered thought card construction; and 2) adaptive reasoning pattern and verification.

### C.1 Action Space

Emerging research suggests that the upper bound of model reasoning capabilities is closely correlated with the available action space [68]. As illustrated in [29], existing approaches typically involve a restricted action space (Table 7), which may hinder LLM’s full reasoning potential. Therefore, we propose a more expansive framework, which contains five atomic reasoning actions as follows:

- • (a1) System Analysis (SA): Analyzing the overall structure of the problem and identifying the constraints and conditions before addressing it, thereby clarifying task requirements effectively.
- • (a2) One-Step Thought (OST): Generating the next one-step thought based on the given question and the preceding reasoning steps.
- • (a3) Chain-of-Thought (CoT): Facilitating step-by-step reasoning by constructing a logical sequence of intermediate thoughts, where each step incrementally builds on the previous ones.
- • (a4) Divide and Conquer (DC): Breaking down a complex reasoning problem into several smaller subproblems and progressively solving them to achieve the overall solution.
- • (a5) Self-Reflection and Refinement (SRR): Engaging in timely reflection of prior solutions and implementing necessary refinement during the reasoning process to ensure accuracy.

- Table 7: Comparison with other tree-based search methods. Note that, most methods contain limited space. In contrast, we define a rich set of reasoning actions, thus enhancing the upper bound of model reasoning capabilities.

### C.2 Monte Carlo Tree Search

As a heuristic search algorithm, MCTS has demonstrated remarkable success in complex reasoning and decision-making environments [63, 26, 27]. The algorithm conceptualizes search spaces as tree structures and has achieved significant breakthroughs across various domains, most notably in gameplaying AI such as AlphaGo and AlphaZero [71]. The basic MCTS algorithm involves an iterative

search process with four key steps: selection, expansion, simulation, and backpropagation. As an example in mathematical reasoning, Figure 7 illustrates the four phases in an iteration, expanding the tree and then updating reward values.

Leveraging MCTS, recent approaches like rStar [29] exploit LLMs’ intrinsic capabilities for iterative exploration to enhance complex reasoning. However, these methods employ a uniform search process across problems of varying difficulty and types, which often results in time-intensive computations. In contrast, our approach employs MCTS only during the generation of prior reasoning patterns (referred to as “thought cards” in Sec. 2.1) and references these thought cards during inference to achieve efficient reasoning. This design enables HiAR-ICL to adaptively match reasoning strategies to the complexity of each problem, significantly reducing the time complexity compared to traditional tree search methods. Additionally, it maintains a comprehensive search space and overall performance, thus achieving an optimal trade-off between efficiency and effectiveness.

For reward values in MCTS, we avoid introducing an additional reward model for scoring for simplicity. Given the current skepticism regarding the self-rewarding capabilities of LLMs, alternative methods are necessary. Inspired by the principle that actions leading to correct answers should be rewarded more frequently, we aim to increase their likelihood of selection in future MCTS tree expansions. Following prior work [29], we define the reward value as the likelihood (or confidence) of self-consistency via majority voting. Note that this principle applies only to leaf nodes. The Q-values of intermediate nodes are initially set to 0 and are dynamically updated during the backpropagation process, as described in Equation 1.

### C.3 Thought Card Selection

Within our proposed cognitive complexity framework, we define three metrics: (1) Subquestion Count (SC): quantifying the number of decomposable subproblems; (2) Problem Condition Complexity (PCC): measuring the number of distinctive problem conditions; and (3) Semantic Similarity (SS): assessing the semantic distance between the target problem and the seed dataset. As presented in Table 4 in Section 4.5, our empirical analysis reveals minimal statistical variations among these metrics. Consequently, we adopt PCC as the primary metric. We conjecture that future research could productively explore sophisticated integration strategies, such as weighted ranking summation, to comprehensively leverage these three metrics and develop a more nuanced quantification of reasoning problem complexity.

### C.4 Verification

In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective two-stage verification method. First, we apply process-supervision scoring to evaluate each reasoning path. The top-3 highest-scoring paths then undergo self-consistency checks to determine the final solution. Our experiments confirm that even these straightforward self-consistency checks effectively identify precise reasoning chains without

additional supervision. In practical implementation, we utilize off-the-shelf pre-trained models: Llama3.1-8B-ORM-Mistral-Data3 (ORM) and Llama3.1-8B-PRM-Mistral-Data4 (PRM). By default, our experimental results are reported based on PRM verification. Moreover, as demonstrated in Table 4 in Section 4.5, our method still achieves notable performance even in scenarios lacking a readily available verification model, such as when relying solely on the simple yet effective method, self-consistency. In future work, we aim to explore more sophisticated verification approaches to more precisely select the optimal reasoning trajectory.

## D More Experimental Details

### D.1 Models

HiAR-ICL is a general approach applicable to various LLMs. In our experiments, we evaluate its effectiveness using powerful open-source models: Llama3-8B-Instruct [3], Llama3.1-8B-Instruct [47], Yi-1.5-6B-Chat [53], Qwen2-7B-Instruct [52], and Qwen2.5-7B/14B-Instruct [51]. Unless stated otherwise, all models are the Instruct version. In E.4 Integration with SFT, we also analyze the performance of HiAR-ICL combined with base models. By focusing on LLMs with parameter counts generally under 10B, we aim to demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of our method. We expect that applying HiAR-ICL to small language models will achieve results comparable to or exceeding closed-source LLMs.

#### D.2 Datasets The datasets utilized in this paper are listed in Table 8.

- • GSM8K [38]: This dataset contains 7,473 training and 1,319 testing grade-school math word problems, which require between 2 to 8 steps for resolution. The solutions primarily involve performing a sequence of basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) to arrive at the final answer.
- • SVAMP [39]: Similar to GSM8K, this dataset contains a 1,000-sample testing set of elementarylevel mathematical word problems (MWPs). These problems exhibit diverse structural variations and challenge large language models (LLMs) to generate precise numerical values or equations for solution. Following the existing dataset partition5, we extract 200 samples from the 700-sample training set as the seed dataset and utilize the remaining 300-sample test set for evaluation.
- • MATH [40]: This dataset includes 12,500 challenging competition-level mathematics problems. Each problem is accompanied by a complete step-by-step solution, which can be leveraged to teach models to generate answer derivations and explanations. Following prior work [29, 37], we utilize MATH500 as our test set for a fair comparison, a representative and highly challenging 10% subset of MATH.
- • AMC [41]: This dataset contains problems from the American Mathematics Competitions, specifically focusing on high-school level mathematical challenges. The AMC problems typically

- 3RLHFlow/Llama3.1-8B-ORM-Mistral-Data
- 4RLHFlow/Llama3.1-8B-PRM-Mistral-Data 5https://huggingface.co/datasets/ChilleD/SVAMP

require sophisticated mathematical reasoning and creative problem-solving strategies beyond basic arithmetic. For our evaluation, we use a subset of 40 carefully selected problems that demonstrate diverse mathematical concepts and varying complexity levels.

- • StrategyQA [42]: This dataset comprises 2,780 examples, each consisting of a strategy question, its decomposition, and supporting evidence paragraphs. We utilize the 687 examples from the test set for evaluation. This dataset challenges models to perform multi-hop reasoning across diverse domains of commonsense knowledge.
- • GPQA [43]: GPQA (Graduate-level Physics Questions and Answers) is a PhD-level scientific knowledge reasoning benchmark that contains complex questions requiring advanced domain expertise. The Diamond198 subset we use for evaluation consists of 198 particularly challenging questions that test deep scientific knowledge and sophisticated reasoning capabilities. These questions often require integration of multiple scientific concepts and principles to reach the correct solution.

For the seed dataset Ds, we randomly sample 200 instances from the training sets of each dataset to construct thought cards. The sampling’s randomness ensures algorithmic robustness. Additionally, only 200 samples are used for tree search, and cross-distribution transfer capabilities have been validated in the main text. Therefore, in practical scenarios, publicly available datasets can be utilized to construct the seed dataset, enabling the construction of thought cards and final reasoning. This ensures the generality of the approach.

### D.3 Baselines

For baselines compared in this paper, we conduct experiments on ICL approaches such as CoT and self-consistency to record their performance. For other tree-based methods and closed-source models, we directly reference their original reported results when accessible. In cases where reported results are unavailable but open-source code is provided, we reproduce experiments following the official official settings.

#### D.4 Card Distribution We analyze the length and diversity of action chains across datasets of varying difficulty. As shown in

- Table 9, both metrics increase with problem complexity. However, many reasoning patterns, such as “decompose and think step by step,” remain consistent across datasets. This consistency helps explain the strong out-of-domain generalization of thought cards, as demonstrated in Figure 5. Additionally, not all five actions are required for each problem. Simpler problems, like Q1 in Figure 2, may require only one action (CoT), whereas more complex problems, like Q4, involve longer chains (SA → OST → SRR → CoT). The number and complexity of actions thus depend heavily on the specific problem at hand.

### D.5 Evaluation Details

As detailed in the main paper, we evaluate our approach using two primary metrics. First, we report accuracy as our primary evaluation metric, where correctness is determined by comparing the model’s final answer with the ground truth. To ensure consistent answer extraction, we require the LLM to explicitly state its solution following a predefined format (e.g., “The answer is”). Second, we measure the average reasoning time to assess our method’s computational efficiency relative to existing search-based approaches. All time measurements were recorded on the same device (A100 GPUs), thereby ensuring fair comparisons.

This section presents supplementary results and analysis, including: comparison with powerful LLMs and methods (E.1), combination with large reasoning models (E.2), multi-task system (E.3), integration with SFT (E.4), performance across problem complexity (E.5), detailed computational cost (E.6), and ablation studies (E.7, effect of atomic action).

### E.1 Detailed Comparison with Powerful LLMs and Methods

Table 10 presents a performance comparison between our method and leading open-source and closedsource models. By employing HiAR-ICL, both our 14B and 7B Qwen2.5 models achieve superior results, surpassing many powerful models with over 100B parameters. Notably, on the challenging MATH dataset, our method demonstrates a significant performance advantage, underscoring its effectiveness in complex reasoning tasks. This highlights the strength of our approach in achieving robust reasoning capabilities while utilizing relatively small models.

We have extended Table 1 to advanced ICL methods (e.g. reinforced ICL), and tree-based methods (e.g. ToT) for a more comprehensive comparison in Table 11. HiAR-ICL consistently outperforms advanced ICL methods and tree-based methods. For example, Llama3-8B’s accuracy on MATH improved from 17.8% (ToT) to 46.6% (HiAR-ICL), a 2.6× improvement.

### E.2 Combination with Large Reasoning Models

As shown below, HiAR-ICL enables smaller models (7B) to approach the performance of larger models like GPT-4o, highlighting its potential to enhance reasoning in small models. It can also be combined with larger reasoning models like QwQ-32B-Preview for even better performance.

### E.3 Multi-Task System

Multi-task learning frameworks [78] represent a promising approach to enhancing general system performance. Here, we aim to explore a generalized system capable of simultaneously handling multiple tasks.

Specifically, we extract 50 exemplars from each of three reasoning domains: mathematical, arithmetic, and commonsense reasoning. These 150 seed data samples are used to construct high-level thought cards, providing guidance signals for subsequent inference. As shown in Table 13, HiAR-ICL still achieves competitive performance, further demonstrating the versatility of our reasoning paradigm.

This result may provide new insights for future research on multi-task general systems, suggesting that exploring high-level patterns across tasks could represent a promising direction.

- Table 13: Multi-task performance of Llama3-8B-Instruct across various reasoning tasks. ‘MT’ refers to generating mixed thought cards to guide subsequent inference, while ‘ICL’ represents the best performance with few-shot CoT. We observe that Our approach is also well-suited as a general multi-task reasoning system.

### E.4 Integration with SFT

Integrating our training-free paradigm, HiAR-ICL, with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) presents an opportunity to expand its applicability and scalability, particularly for complex reasoning tasks. Here, we conduct exploratory experiments to assess the compatibility between the two approaches.

- As shown in Table 14, we evaluate both pretrained checkpoints and instruction-tuned versions of Llama3-8B and Llama3.1-8B.

Our results show that, when applied to base models (Llama3-8B and Llama3.1-8B), HiAR-ICL achieves substantial performance improvements through its structured guidance mechanism, significantly outperforming both zero-shot and few-shot baselines. The performance gains are particularly notable, reaching improvements of up to 26.6% on average across multiple benchmarks. More importantly, when integrated with instruction-tuned models, HiAR-ICL continues to deliver remarkable enhancements, with consistent improvements across all evaluated tasks, demonstrating strong synergy between structured reasoning and SFT techniques.

These findings suggest that our reasoning paradigm can be effectively integrated with SFT to enhance model performance. In future work, we plan to explore more sophisticated integration strategies, such as injecting structured long-chain reasoning data (i.e., reasoning patterns encoded on thought cards) into the model’s inference process through SFT. This could involve techniques inspired by chain-of-preference optimization (CPO) [79], further optimizing model reasoning efficiency and scalability.

### E.5 Performance across Problem Complexity

- As shown in Table 15, we present the performance of Llama3-8B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct on Zero-shot CoT, Few-shot CoT+SC, and our method, HiAR-ICL, across different difficulty levels of the challenging MATH dataset. Taking Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct as an example, our approach improves performance across all levels, with an average accuracy boost of 2.6% for the easier levels 1-3. Notably, for the more difficult level 4, the improvement reaches +7.7%. This indicates that our method has the potential to solve more challenging problems and enhance reasoning performance. This may be due to the introduction of high-level reasoning patterns, which help LLMs find a clearer solution more quickly.

### E.6 Detailed Computational Cost

In this section, we present a more comprehensive analysis of the time cost of HiAR-ICL. Additionally, we include an extended comparison with representative MCTS-based methods to show that HiARICL’s high efficiency.

For clarity, we first define the time cost. For downstream evaluation tasks, the average time cost per sample is formally defined in Equation 8, where “total offline construction time” represents the time cost of constructing thought cards using 200 seed samples, and “total online inference time” represents the inference time on n downstream samples. Importantly, the offline construction overhead is fixed and independent of downstream task scale. As the number of test samples (n) increases, the amortized offline cost per sample diminishes.

We conducted experiments on Llama3-8B on three downstream evaluation tasks: GSM8K, MATH and STG, the results are shown in Table 16. HiAR-ICL maintains high efficiency while achieving strong accuracy on downstream tasks. For example, on the STG task, it achieves the highest accuracy while using only 5% of the time required by rStar, demonstrating the efficiency of the proposed method.

### E.7 Ablation Studies

In addition to the ablation studies on modules 1 (thought cards construction), and 2 (reasoning pattern selection, verification) in the main text, we present additional results on module 1 (effect of each atomic action).

Effect of Each Atomic Action We conduct an ablation study to evaluate the effectiveness of each atomic action within our proposed action space using the Llama3-8B-Instruct model. Our experiments in Table 17 highlight the critical importance of individual action components. Compared to existing approaches with typically restrictive action spaces (as shown in Table 7), our expanded action space yields significant performance improvements. The study may open avenues for future research, particularly in developing adaptive action space selection mechanisms for broader problem domains. We aim to enhance approach generalization by dynamically customizing action spaces, with a specific focus on emerging multimodal reasoning tasks.

## F Case Study

Figures 8-12 present detailed problem-solving examples employing our method and in-context learning. Our approach demonstrates notable advantages in addressing relatively challenging problems, effectively leveraging the rich action space and guidance-providing thought cards to achieve precise reasoning. For instance, in Figure 8, both ICL and GPT-4o (results) output incorrect results, while our method with Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct provides a logically clear solution process and ultimately arrives at the correct answer.

###### Example 1 on MATH – Number Theory

Question What is the least positive integer multiple of 30 that can be written with only the digits 0 and 2?

Let $M$ be the least positive multiple of 30 that can be written with only the digits 0 and 2. First, $M$ is a multiple of 10, so its units digit must be 0. $M$ is also a multiple of 3, which means the sum of its digits must be a multiple of 3.

Ground Truth

Therefore, we must take at least three 2's. Since $M$ is minimal, we take exactly three 2's and do not have any additional 0's: $M=\\boxed{2220}$. ####

We are tasked with finding the least positive integer multiple of 30 that can be written using only the digits 0 and 2. A number that is a multiple of 30 must satisfy two conditions:

1. It must be divisible by 2. 2. It must be divisible by 3.

- **Divisibility by 2:**

- For divisibility by 2, the last digit of the number must be even. Since the only digits allowed are 0 and 2, the last digit must be 2.

**Divisibility by 3:**

- For divisibility by 3, the sum of the digits of the number must be divisible by 3. Since the digits are restricted to 0 and 2, we need to ensure that the sum of the

digits is divisible by 3. Let’s start by examining small numbers made up of the digits 0 and 2, checking each for divisibility by both 2 and 3.

**Step-by-Step Process:**

**2:** a. Last digit is 2 (divisible by 2). b. Sum of digits is 222, which is not divisible by 3. c. Not divisible by 3. **20** a. Last digit is 0 (divisible by 2). b. Sum of digits is 2+0=2, which is not divisible by 3. c. Not divisible by 3. **22** a. Last digit is 2 (divisible by 2). b. Sum of digits is 2+2=4, which is not divisible by 3. c. Not divisible by 3. **202** a. Last digit is 2 (divisible by 2). b. Sum of digits is 2+0+2=4, which is not divisible by 3. c. Not divisible by 3. **220** a. Last digit is 2 (divisible by 2) b. Sum of digits is 2+2+0=4, which is not divisible by 3. c. Not divisible by 3. **222** a. Last digit is 2 (divisible by 2) b. Sum of digits is 2+2+2=6, which is divisible by 3. c. Divisible by both 2 and 3.

Let's think step by step.

- Step 1: Divide and Conquer SubQ 1.1: What are the factors of 30? SubA 1.1: The factors of 30 are 2, 3, and 5. The answer is 2, 3, and 5.
- Step 2: Divide and Conquer SubQ 1.2: What is the smallest digit that needs to appear at least once in our

number to make sure it's divisible by 30?

SubA 1.2: To ensure divisibility by 30, which includes being divisible by 3 (sum of digits must be a multiple of 3), we need at least the digit 2 to satisfy this condition. The answer is 3.

- Step 3: Chain-of-Thought Let’s think step by step.

- 1. We need a number that is divisible by both 2 and 3.
- 2. Since the number will only consist of the digits 0 and 2, it won't have

any factors other than powers of 2 and 5.

- 3. Thus, we want to find the smallest such number that contains at least

one factor of each power of 2 (to include all even numbers) and has a factor of 3 (so that it is divisible by 3).

- 4. Let $n = 2^{m} \\cdot 5^p$ for some non-negative integers $m$ and

$p$. The smallest possible value of $n$ occurs when $m=1$, which means $n = 2 \\cdot 5^p$.

- 5. Since $5^p$ must contain at least two digits if it is greater than 1, we

know that $p$ cannot be less than 2. So the lowest possible value for $n$

is when $p=2$, giving us $n = 2 \\cdot 25 = 50.$

- 6. However, this is not the correct solution because we also need our

number to be divisible by 3, and $50$ is not divisible by 3.

- 7. Instead, let's try adding another factor of 2, so that $n = 4 \\cdot 25 =

100,$ which is divisible by 3.

- 8. Therefore, $\\boxed{100}$ is the smallest such number.

- 1. To find the least positive integer multiple of 30 that can be written with

only the digits 0 and 2, let's consider the factors of 30 as mentioned in Step 1. These factors are 2, 3, and 5.

- 2. From Step 2, we know that to be divisible by 30, the number must be

divisible by both 3 and 5. For divisibility by 5, the last digit must be 0. For divisibility by 3, the sum of the digits must be a multiple of 3.

- 3. Starting with the smallest possible numbers composed of the digits 0 and 2:

- a. **Two-digit numbers**: 20: Sum = 2 (not divisible by 3) 02: Not valid since leading zeros are not allowed
- b. **Three-digit numbers**: 202: Sum = 2 + 0 + 2 = 4 (not divisible by 3) 220: Sum = 2 + 2 + 0 = 4 (not divisible by 3)
- c. **Four-digit numbers**: 2020: Sum = 2 + 0 + 2 + 0 = 4 (not divisible by 3) 2200: Sum = 2 + 2 + 0 + 0 = 4 (not divisible by 3) 2220: Sum = 2 + 2 + 2 + 0 = 6 (divisible by 3) and ends in 0 (divisible by 5)

|100|
|---|

The answer is:

Since 2220 satisfies all conditions (divisibility by 2, 3, and 5), it is the smallest such number. Thus, the least positive integer multiple of 30 that can be written with only the digits 0 and 2 is \\(\\boxed{2220}\\).

The triangle is a right triangle, so sin D = EF / DF. Then we have that sin D = 0.7 = 7 / DF, so DF = 10. Using the Pythagorean Theorem, we find that the length of DE is \sqrt{DF^2 - EF^2}, or \sqrt{100 - 49} = \\boxed{\sqrt{51}}.

We are given a right triangle ΔDEF with a right angle at E, an we know that sinD=0.7. We need to find the length of DE.

- **Step 1: Identify given information** The triangle has the following properties:

1. ∠DEF=90 ^\\circ (right angle at E) 2. sin D = 0.7 3. The length of side EF=7

Let the sides of the triangle be:

1. DE (the side opposite to angle ∠DEF, which we need to find) 2. DF (the hypotenuse of the triangle)

- **Step 2: Use the sine definition** The sine of an angle in a right triangle is defined as the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the hypotenuse. For angle D, we have:

sin D=opposite / hypotenuse = EF / DF From the problem, we know that sin D = 0.7 and EF=7, so we can write: 0.7 = 7 / DF

- **Step 3: Solve for DF** To solve for DF, multiply both sides of the equation by DF and then divide by 0.7: DF = 7/0.7 = 10 Thus, the length of the hypotenuse is 10
- **Step 4: Use the Pythagorean theorem** We now use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of DE. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle: DE^2 + EF^2 = DF^2 Substitute the known values for EF=7 and DF = 10: DE^2 + 7^2 = 10^2, DE^2 + 49^2 = 100, DE^2 = 100-49=51
- **Step 5: Solve for DE** Take the square root of both sides to find DE: DE = \sqrt{51}

Let's think step by step.

- Step 1: One-Step Thought Identify the right triangle. Here, it's triangle DEF, where DE is perpendicular

to EF, making angle DEF a right angle

- Step 2: Chain-of-Thought Let’s think step by step.

- 1. By definition, sin D = EF / DF, so EF = DF·sin D = 7\\cdot0.7=4.9$.
- 2. Therefore, the length of segment $DE$ is $\\boxed{4.9}$.

|4.9|

The answer is:

- 1. From the problem, we know that ΔDEF is a right triangle with ∠DEF =

90^\\circ, and EF = 7.

- 2. Given that sin D = 0.7, we recognize that sin D = opposite / hypotenuse = EF / DF = 7 / DF.

Thus, DF = 7 / sin D = 7 / 0.7 = 10.

- 3. Now, since ΔDEF is a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem

to find DE: DE^2 + EF^2 = DF^2

Substituting the known values, we get： DE^2 + 7^2 = 10^2 DE^2 + 49 = 100 DE^2 = 51

Taking the square root of both sides, we obtain DE = \sqrt{51}. Therefore, the length of $DE$ is $\\boxed{\sqrt{51}}$. The answer is: \sqrt{51}.
