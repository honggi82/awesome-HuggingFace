#### Abstract

Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enabled LLM-based agents to successfully tackle interactive planning tasks. However, despite their successes, existing approaches often suffer from planning hallucinations and require retraining for each new agent. To address these challenges, we propose the Meta Plan Optimization (MPO) framework, which enhances agent planning capabilities by directly incorporating explicit guidance. Unlike previous methods that rely on complex knowledge, which either require significant human effort or lack quality assurance, MPO leverages high-level general guidance through meta plans to assist agent planning and enables continuous optimization of the meta plans based on feedback from the agent’s task execution. Our experiments conducted on three representative tasks demonstrate that MPO significantly outperforms existing baselines. Moreover, our analysis shows that MPO provides a portable solution that enhances both task completion efficiency and generalization capabilities across new agents and unseen scenarios.

#### 1 Introduction

Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) (Achiam et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2024; Yang et al., 2024a) have enabled LLM-based agents to tackle complex multi-step tasks, including embodied housework (Shridhar et al., 2020) and science experiments (Wang et al., 2022). These tasks require sophisticated planning abilities, as agents need to understand long-term dependencies (Zhang et al., 2024), reason about sequential actions, and adapt to dynamic environments (Yao et al., 2022). The planning quality of these agents plays a crucial role in determining their overall performance.

Current mainstream LLM-based agents primarily develop their planning capabilities through

implicit methods, either directly leveraging the model’s inner ability or fine-tuning from expert trajectories. For example, ReAct (Yao et al., 2022) and Reflexion (Shinn et al., 2024) perform planning on-the-fly during task execution and are prone to getting lost due to planning hallucination (Zhu et al., 2024). The works including AgentTuning (Zeng et al., 2023), Lumos (Yin et al., 2023), and ETO (Song et al., 2024b) employ trajectory tuning to enhance implicit planning capabilities and require retraining for each new agent, resulting in huge computational cost (Figure 1(a)).

Beyond implicit planning, recent studies have explored the use of human knowledge to guide agents in task execution, capitalizing on the benefits of explicit guidance and low integration costs of such knowledge (Zhu et al., 2024; Qiao et al., 2024). However, these approaches face significant challenges: they either require extensive manual efforts or struggle to ensure quality in the process of acquiring complex knowledge, potentially leading to inconsistent improvements in agent perfor-

mance (Wang et al., 2024). To overcome these limitations, we propose to automatically generate a high-level abstract guidance, termed Meta Plan, which emulates human prior knowledge. Unlike previous implicit plans derived during execution, meta plans are decoupled from specific environmental details and complex agent trajectories, reducing the difficulty of knowledge acquisition. Figure 1(b) illustrates an abstract meta plan for the task "put some watch on safe". In contrast to the concrete plan in Figure 1(a), the meta plan omits fine-grained details (e.g., cabinet 4). To further enhance meta plan quality, we design a Meta Plan Optimization (MPO) framework that iteratively improves plans based on environmental feedback. This process mirrors how humans refine their strategies through experience, ensuring that meta plans evolve over time for optimal task execution.

The MPO framework comprises two key components: a meta planner and an agent. The meta planner generates high-level meta plans, while the agent provides execution feedback to evaluate the quality of the input meta plans and guide meta planner refinement. Initially, we collect meta plans from expert trajectories and cold-start the meta planner through supervised fine-tuning. To further optimize the meta planner, we use Monte Carlo (MC) sampling to estimate the task completion rate of the agent as feedback. Specifically, given a task, the planner generates multiple meta plans through sampling. Then for each meta plan, the agent is also sampled to produce multiple execution trajectories, and the task completion rate is estimated accordingly. After identifying contrastive meta plan pairs—those yielding the highest and lowest task completion rates—we apply DPO (Rafailov et al., 2024) to refine the meta planner on these plan pairs. Finally, the trained meta planner can be detached from the MPO framework and function as a portable component, capable of generating highquality meta plans for tasks in the target environment. This facilitates task completion for any new agent without incurring additional training costs.

We evaluate our approach on three representative benchmarks: ALFWorld (Shridhar et al., 2020) for embodied household tasks, ScienceWorld (Wang et al., 2022) for textual science experiment tasks and WebShop (?) for online web navigation tasks. Across all test tasks, agents equipped with our meta planner consistently outperform those without it, achieving at least a 5.6% average improvement in performance. Additionally, the meta planner is

compatible with various agent training frameworks, and its meta plans can be directly inserted into task instructions. Combined with these methods, our approach yields even greater performance gains, demonstrating effectiveness in a larger application scope. Further analysis reveals that our generated meta plans significantly increase the agent’s average reward per action, thereby improving task completion efficiency.

In summary, our contributions are as follows:

- • We introduce the MPO, which leverages meta plan optimization to improve the performance of LLM agents. This progress provides an innovative approach to explicitly enhance agents’ planning capabilities while maintaining compatibility with previous agent training frameworks.
- • Extensive experiments conducted on three representative benchmarks demonstrate that our method has significantly improved the performance of existing LLM agents.
- • Further analysis indicates that: (1) Our proposed method substantially boosts the agent’s task completion efficiency; (2) A lightweight meta planner can guide more powerful agents in their planning. and (3) MPO increases the correctness, followability, and standardization of the meta plan.

#### 2 Task Formulation

LLM Agent Planning The primary scope of this study is the planning of LLM agents interacting with the environment and receiving feedback for task solution. Following Song et al. (2024b), the agent’s task planning trajectory can be represented as e = (u,a1,o1,...,an), where u ∈ U is the task instruction, a ∈ A the agent actions, and o ∈ O the observation from the environment. At each time step t, the agent performs implicit planning and generates the corresponding action at ∼ πθ(·|u,a1,o1,...,ot−1). The probability of generating the task planning trajectory is given by:

πθ(e|u) =

n

πθ(at|u,a1,o1,...,ot−1) (1)

t=1

Finally, the final reward r(u,e) ∈ [0,1] representing the task completion rate is calculated.

Meta Plan The meta plan serves as high-level, natural guidance to assist in agent planning. It outlines an abstract, general strategy for task completion that is decoupled from specific environmental

details, indicating its potential to generalize across various agents. For instance, given the instruction "look at the CD under the desklamp", the meta plan could be: "1. Go to where the CD may be placed. 2. Take the CD from where you found it. 3. Go to where the desklamp is located. 4. Use the desklamp to look at the CD." A low-quality meta plan might mislead the agent’s planning process. To ensure meta plan quality, MPO develops a lightweight parameterized meta planner πg to generate meta plans, which can be further optimized to produce better results. After incorporating the meta plan p ∼ πg(·|u), the probability of the agent generating trajectory e is formulated as:

task completion trajectories without corresponding meta plans. Therefore, we first need to construct a training dataset for meta plan generation. To achieve this, we leverage GPT-4o to assist in creating the dataset. We provide the model with the original task instruction u and the corresponding golden trajectory e as the prompt, allowing it to summarize a generalizable plan p from the trajectory. The specific prompt template can be found in Appendix E.1. To ensure the quality of the meta plan p, we manually review the results generated by GPT-4o and refine any meta plans that are incorrect, overly complex, or non-standard. This quality control process ensures that each meta plan p represents a reusable planning strategy that effectively assists agents in task completion. The detailed process for controlling the quality of the seed meta plan set can be found in Appendix C. Since the meta planner needs to generate plans without access to golden trajectories during inference, we remove them from the training data, thus obtaining the initialization dataset for the meta planner:

πθ(e|u,p) =

#### 3 Method

The overall framework of our method is illustrated in Figure 2. First, we construct a seed meta plan training set to initialize a basic meta planner (§ 3.1). Then, we develop the MC method to assess the quality of the meta plan through exploration (§ 3.2). Finally, we further enhance the meta planner via preference-based optimization using contrastive meta plan pairs (§ 3.3).

|Ds| i=1

Ds = (u,p)(i)

(3)

We then fine-tune the model on the auto-regressive loss the get the initialized meta planner πg:

To equip the meta planner with the foundational capabilities to generate meta plans based on task instructions and the environmental state, we initialize the model using supervised fine-tuning. However, existing agent datasets only provide golden

To further enhance the meta planner, we need to evaluate the quality of its generated meta plans. While prior studies typically rely on reward models

trained on human preference annotations (Bai et al., 2022a; Ouyang et al., 2022; Dubey et al., 2024) or advanced AI (Bai et al., 2022b; Lee et al., 2023) models to assess model outputs, these approaches have limitations. They not only incur additional costs for human labeling or API calls, but may also be less applicable to LLM agents, as their preferences for meta plans are not aligned with the agent or task environment. To circumvent these challenges, we adopt an exploration-based approach to evaluate the quality of meta plans.

Intuitively, a higher-quality meta plan should enable the agent to more easily succeed in the task. Therefore, for a give meta plan p, we insert it into the prompt of the agent and have the agent attempt to complete the task N times. This results in N task completion trajectories generated by the agent:

{e(i)|i = 1,...,N} ∼ πθ(e|u,p) (5)

For each trajectory e(i), the environment returns the task completion rate r(u,e(i)). Thus, the quality of the meta plan p is determined by the agent success rate in completing the task based on it, which can be represented as:

1 N

Q(p) =

N

r(u,e(i)) (6)

i=1

In this paper, we use Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct (Dubey et al., 2024) as the agent to evaluate the quality of the meta plans. This model demonstrates strong instructing-following capabilities and is already effective at completing agent tasks. Moreover, the meta plans evaluated with this model can be generalized to agents based on other models, which we verify in the experiments later.

##### 3.3 Meta Planner DPO Training

After we are able to automatically evaluate the quality of meta plans, we can further optimize the SFT-initialized meta planner through reinforcement learning. We choose DPO (Rafailov et al., 2024) as our optimization algorithm due to its training stability and low resource consumption. The DPO algorithm requires paired preference data to optimize the meta planner, specifically pairs of highand low-quality meta plans. We construct the DPO preference dataset Dc from the task training set, where the SFT-initialized meta planner generates M meta plans {pi|i = 1,...,M} ∼ πg(p|u). We then compute scores for each meta plan using the MC method described in Section 3.2. The highest

and lowest quality meta plans are selected as the chosen and rejected pairs pw and pl. If all meta plans are of the same quality, we skip this sample. This forms our preference training dataset:

|Dc| i=1

Dc = (u,pw,pl)(i)

(7)

Given the preference dataset Dc, DPO optimizes the model to increase the likelihood of the chosen meta plan pw over the rejected one pl. We fine-tune the meta planner by minimizing the DPO loss:

πθ(pw|u) πref(pw|u) −β log

LDPO(πθ;πref) = −E(u,pw,pl)∼Dc log σ(β log

πθ(pl|u) πref(pl|u)

) ,

(8) This equation reflects the goal of maximizing the probability of generating the higher-quality meta plan pw over the lower-quality meta plan pl for a given task instruction u. By constructing the preference dataset and applying DPO optimization, the meta planner becomes more effective at generating high-quality meta plans, therefore better guiding the agent planning process.

#### 4 Experiments

##### 4.1 Experiment Settings

Datasets We conducted experiments on three representative agent datasets: ScienceWorld (Wang et al., 2022) for textual science experiment tasks, ALFWorld (Shridhar et al., 2020) for embodied household tasks, and WebShop for online web navigation tasks (?). Both ScienceWorld and WebShop provide dense rewards ranging from 0 to 1, while ALFWorld offers only binary rewards to indicate whether the task is completed. For details of the datasets, please refer to Appendix A.

The statistical information of our datasets is presented in Table 1. It is important to note that in addition to the in-distribution test sets, both ALFWorld and ScienceWorld include test sets that include outof-distribution unseen variations. These additional test sets enable us to evaluate the generalization capabilities of the meta planner.

Implementation Details We use Llama-3.1-8BInstruct (Dubey et al., 2024) as the base model to construct the meta planner. For SFT initialization, we set the batch size to 32, the learning rate to 1e5 and employ a cosine scheduler with 3 training epochs. For DPO (Rafailov et al., 2024) training, we configure the meta planner to generate M = 5 meta plans per task with a generation temperature of 0.7. To evaluate meta plan quality, we set the agents to generate N = 5 task completion trajectories for each meta plan, also using a temperature of 0.7. We utilize vLLM (Kwon et al., 2023) to accelerate the generation process. For DPO training, the batch size is 32, and the learning rate is 1e-5 with a 3% warm-up phase, and a cosine scheduler is used. The β parameter in the DPO loss function is set to 0.1 for the ALFWorld, ScienceWorld and WebShop datasets, with training conducted over 3 epochs. All training procedures are implemented using Llama-Factory (Zheng et al., 2024) with full parameter fine-tuning. The experiments are conducted on 8 NVIDIA A100 80GB GPUs.

Base Agents We evaluate our method on two types of agents, guided by MPO-optimized meta plans: (1) Agents without training, which deploy the ReAct framework using foundation models without additional training. We test two proprietary models, including GPT-4o and GPT-4omini (Achiam et al., 2023) as well as several open-

source models, including Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct (Dubey et al., 2024), and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct (Yang et al., 2024a). (2) Agents with training, which enhance agent planning capabilities via parameter updates to foundation models. We examine two agent frameworks: AgentTuning (Zeng et al., 2023), which uses Supervised Fine-Tuning from expert trajectories to improve the agent capabilities of the base model, and ETO (Song et al., 2024b), which learns from failed trajectories and proposes an exploration-based trajectory optimization method to enhance the tasksolving process. We also compare with KnowAgent (Zhu et al., 2024) and WKM (Qiao et al., 2024), which also inject explicit guidance into the agent planning process. These two methods require fine-tuning the base models, making them incompatible with other agent frameworks.

Evaluation To ensure experimental reproducibility, we set the decoding temperature to 0 for both meta plan generation by the meta planner and task trajectory generation by the agent. For meta plan generation, we employ a zero-shot prompting approach. When generating task completion trajectories, we include a 1-shot in-context example for each task. The detailed prompts are provided in Appendix E.2. Note that once the meta plans for the test set tasks are generated by the meta planner, we use them across all agents without further

modification. Our primary evaluation metric is the Average Reward, which calculates the mean reward across all test set task instances. We also report the Success Rate in Appendix B. We will release the generated meta plans and parameters of the optimized meta planner upon acceptance.

- 4.2 Results

- As shown in Table 2, the incorporation of MPOoptimized meta plans consistently improves agent performance across all tasks and frameworks, with the average performance increasing by up to 40.5% for the Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct based agent. Moreover, our meta planner is compatible with other agent training frameworks. The MPO-enhanced Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-ETO achieves an average reward 3.5 higher the the current SOTA explicit guidance method, WKM. These results demonstrate that our general high-level meta plan, optimized through agent feedback, outperforms complex knowledge-based guidance that relies heavily on manual efforts, lacks generalization ability, and offers no quality assurance. This underscores the effectiveness of our approach in significantly boosting agent performance. Furthermore, our method demonstrates strong effectiveness in unseen scenarios. For the unseen parts of ScienceWorld and ALFWorld, despite never having encountered these tasks, the meta planner is able to generalize to them and generate high-quality meta plans. This improves the success rate of GPT-4o on the unseen part of ALFWorld by 9.7, achieving a success rate of 93.3. These results highlight that MPO can further enhance the agent’s generalization capabilities, particularly in out-of-distribution scenarios.

We conduct ablation experiments on the training methods of the meta planner. For ScienceWorld and ALFWorld, we evaluate on the unseen test set.

- As shown in Table 3, the meta planner optimized by MPO yields greater improvements in agent performance compared to other training methods. It also outperforms directly prompting GPT-4o as the meta planner, which relies solely on its prior knowledge without optimizing the meta plan through environment exploration. This suggests that exploring the environment and learning from comparisons enable the meta planner to produce higher-quality meta plans. Additionally, when us-

ing SFT-initialized meta plans, the performance of the Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct model decreases on both evaluation datasets, indicating that a low-quality meta plan may mislead the agent planning process.

##### 5.2 How to Use Meta Plan?

In our main experiments, the meta plan is incorporated into the task instructions to guide the agent planning process. Here, we investigate the impact of different insertion positions on agent performance: in the task instruction, in the agent’s thought process and in the environment observation. As shown in Table 4, we find that insertion into the task instruction consistently yields the best performance across all agents and tasks, while insertion into the thought process leads to the worst performance. This suggests that disrupting the agent’s normal reasoning process negatively affects planning accuracy. Additionally, we observe that inserting the meta plan at other positions causes greater performance drops in agent frameworks with training, likely because the training data does not involve meta plans. In contrast, insertion into the instruction causes minimal disruption to the origi-

nal task completion process. These results suggest that inserting the meta plan in the task instruction ensures optimal performance.

- 5.3 Efficiency Analysis

Another advantage of incorporating high-quality meta plans is that it prevents agents from unnecessary exploration, thus improving their task completion efficiency. Following Xiong et al. (2024), we evaluate action efficiency using the average reward per step, calculated for each task as the ratio of the final reward to the number of steps required to complete the task, and then averaging these values across the entire test set. Figure 3 shows the significant improvements in average step rewards achieved by our MPO compared to both the nometa-plan (N/A) and SFT-initialized meta plans. It is also clear that for the unseen test tasks, MPO leads to an even greater increase in average reward per step, demonstrating its strong generalization to out-of-distribution tasks. These results underscore the superior performance of MPO, confirming its effectiveness in enhancing agent action efficiency.

- Figure 5: Impact of sampling count N and M in contrastive meta plan construction on agent performance.

As shown in Figure 4, MPO can enhance agent performance across a wide range of parameter sizes, with the most significant improvements observed in agents with medium-sized parameters. Moreover, as a lightweight model, the meta planner has the potential to enhance more powerful agents portably without requiring their retraining.

5.5 Effect of Sampling Count on Performance We analyze how the sampling counts, M for meta plan generation and N for task trajectory sampling affect the trained meta planner’s performance. We use the average score of the agent enhanced by the optimized meta plans as the evaluation metric, varying one parameter while fixing the other. As shown in Figure 5, lower sampling counts significantly reduce meta plan quality, with N having a stronger

effect. This is likely because insufficient task trajectories reduce the accuracy of meta plan quality estimation. Moreover, the performance gains from increasing N and M quickly saturate. Considering sampling efficiency, we set N = M = 5 in the main experiments, striking a balance between sampling cost and meta planner performance gains.

##### 5.6 What Makes a Good Meta Plan?

We further investigate why the meta plans optimized through exploration in MPO outperform those obtained soly through SFT initialization. We evaluate the meta plans from three perspectives: correctness, followability, and standardization, using GPT-4o for automated assessment. The evaluation details and prompts can be found in Appendix E.3. As shown in Figure 6, MPO-optimized meta plans consistently outperform SFT-initialized ones across all three dimensions. The advantages in correctness and followability make it easier for the agent to effectively plan and execute tasks, leading to higher task completion rates. Please refer to Appendix D for a more detailed case study.

#### 6 Related Work

LLM as Agents With advancements in reasoning and instruction-following capabilities of large language models (Wei et al., 2022a), researchers have begun using prompting methods (Wei et al., 2022b; Song et al., 2023) or more complex strategies (Koh et al., 2024) to build agents capable of leveraging tools (Qin et al., 2023), solving problems, writing code (Qian et al., 2023), and completing real-world tasks (Patil et al., 2023; Gur et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2024b). To enhance open-source models as agents, some works (Zeng et al., 2023; Song et al., 2024a) use expert trajectories for supervised fine-tuning LLMs, while others (Song et al., 2024b; Xiong et al., 2024; ?) enable agents to explore the environment autonomously and leverage reinforcement

learning to learn from failed experiences. However, these methods require retraining each time a new agent is deployed, leading to significant computational overhead.

Planning in LLM Agents Planning (Huang et al., 2024) is essential for intelligent agents to complete real-world tasks, involving the decomposition of complex instructions into sub-tasks and acting on them sequentially. Previous works (Yao et al., 2022; Shinn et al., 2024) primarily focus on implicit planning, where planning occurs through interleaved reasoning and action generation. To address the challenges of myopic reasoning and planning hallucination in implicit planning (Zhu et al., 2024), some approaches (Guan et al., 2024; Li et al., 2024; Zhao et al., 2024; Zhu et al., 2024) have explored using explicit knowledge to guide task execution. However, these methods often require manually designed prompt templates or task procedures, limiting their transferability across environments. Some works (?Ye et al., 2023; Fu et al., 2024) use language models to automate task knowledge synthesis or subgoal planning, but the generated knowledge cannot be further refined through exploration and environmental feedback, leading to suboptimal performance. In contrast, our MPO introduces an automatically generated meta plan that provides high-level, abstract guidance to assist in agent planning, while allowing further quality enhancement based on feedback from the task completion process.

#### 7 Conclusion

In this paper, we introduce MPO, a novel framework for enhancing the performance of LLM-based agents. MPO incorporates abstract, high-level guidance via meta plans, offering an innovative solution to explicitly improve the agent’s planning capabilities. By utilizing feedback from the agent’s task

execution, MPO enables continuous enhancement of the meta plan quality. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms existing baselines and is applicable to agents across a wide range of parameter sizes. These findings highlight the potential of our approach to advance agent planning capabilities, paving the way for future developments in artificial general intelligence.

#### Limitations

Despite achieving superior performance compared to other baselines, it is important to acknowledge several limitations of this work. 1) Our approach uses Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct as the base model to construct the meta planner. However, it is worth exploring the potential differences when utilizing other base models or models with varying parameter sizes for the meta planner. Future work could investigate the use of more lightweight models, such as those with as few as 1B parameters, to enhance computational efficiency. 2) Our method only focuses on constructing a separate meta planner for each individual task. However, building a meta planner that incorporates data from multiple tasks may allow it to learn from diverse knowledge sources, resulting in higher-quality meta plans. Future research could develop a unified meta planner that is applicable to various tasks. 3) In the meta planner DPO training, we employ simple sampling and Monte Carlo methods to construct contrastive meta plan pairs. Future work could explore the application of MCTS methods to improve the efficiency of the sampling process.

#### A Dataset Details

ScienceWorld ScienceWorld (Wang et al., 2022) is a text-based virtual environment that provides a testing platform for AI research, specifically designed to evaluate and improve AI systems’ scientific reasoning abilities. Researchers can use this platform to assess the performance of AI agents in open, complex environments. ScienceWorld simulates tasks from standard elementary school science curricula, covering areas such as state changes of matter, measurement, electricity, life sciences, plant growth, chemical reactions, and genetics. Agents are deployed in an embodied interactive environment to understand and apply complex scientific concepts. Tasks in ScienceWorld involve several subgoals, and the overall final reward is calculated based on the completion of these subgoals.

The original test set of ScienceWorld includes unseen task variations. For example, in the training set, a task may involve boiling water, while in the test set, the task may be boiling lead. Following Song et al. (2024b), we use the original test set to evaluate the generalization ability of our meta planner in unseen scenarios, and the original validation set serves as our test set for seen scenarios. ALFWorld ALFWorld (Shridhar et al., 2020) are household tasks that require agents to explore rooms and use commonsense reasoning to perform tasks, such as "put a pencil on the desk". The environment provides the outcome on whether the agent successfully completes the task within given steps. The original ALFWorld dataset comprises both seen and unseen evaluation sets. The seen set is designed to assess in-distribution generalization, whereas the unseen set with new tasks measures out-of-distribution generalization of the agents.

WebShop WebShop (?) is a simulated ecommerce website environment containing 1.18 million real-world products. In this environment, agents are required to navigate through various types of webpages and perform diverse actions to find, customize, and purchase items based on natural language instructions. Once the agent clicks the "buy" option, the environment provides a final reward, which is calculated based on the matching heuristics of the product’s attributes and price.

#### B Success Rate

We report the success rate of our experiments in Table 6. Note that the definition of success rate dif-

fers between the two tasks. For ScienceWorld, the original paper does not provide a specific definition for success rate. However, based on the official environment, a trajectory is considered successful if the agent reaches a predefined latent state, even if the reward is not exactly 1.0. For ALFWorld, since it only provides binary final rewards, the success rate is equivalent to the average final reward. After inserting the MPO-optimized meta plan, all agents show consistent and significant success rate improvements across both tasks.

#### C Seed Meta Plans Quality Control

A high-quality seed meta plan training set is crucial for initializing a more effective meta planner. As such, we carefully control the quality of the meta plans generated by GPT-4o. We have identified several key issues with the meta plans it produces: (1) they often include excessively detailed steps or environmental information, which makes them difficult to generalize and optimize; (2) they sometimes feature manipulation types that are not applicable to the environment; (3) they fail to adhere to the predefined meta plan format. To address the first two issues, we adjust the temperature during GPT-4o’s generation and re-summarize the meta plan. For the third issue, we additionally prompt GPT-4o to extract correctly formatted meta plans from the response. Although manual verification is required to ensure quality, the human effort involved in this process is negligible compared to the manual construction of knowledge in Zhu et al. (2024).

#### D Case Study

Here we provide a detailed comparison of agent trajectories on the same task within ALFWorld, after inserting meta plans optimized by two different methods: SFT and MPO. This comparison demonstrates how MPO provides higher-quality plan guidance. The case is shown in Figure 14. The agent used in this case study is Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct.

In the ALFWorld scenario, the meta plan generated by the SFT-initialized meta planner mistakenly includes the instruction "go to sidetable", which misleads the agent into repeatedly executing the erroneous plan "I can try to go to sidetable first," resulting in plan hallucination. In contrast, the MPO-optimized meta planner generates a higherquality meta plan: "go to where the first pillow may be located." This plan outlines an abstract,

You are a helpful assistant to do some scientific experiment in an environment. In the environment, there are several rooms: kitchen, foundry, workshop, bathroom, outside, living room, bedroom, greenhouse, art studio, hallway. You should explore the environment and find the items you need to complete the experiment. You can teleport to any room in one step. All containers in the environment have already been opened, you can directly get items from the containers. For each of your turn, you will be given the observation of the last turn. You should choose from two actions: "Thought" or "Action". If you choose "Thought", you should first think about the current condition and plan for your future actions, and then output your action in this turn. Your output must strictly follow this format:"Thought: your thoughts.\n Action: your next action"; If you choose "Action", you should directly output the action in this turn. Your output must strictly follow this format:"Action: your next action". Remember that you can only output one "Action:" in per response.

The available actions are: open OBJ: open a container close OBJ: close a container activate OBJ: activate a device deactivate OBJ: deactivate a device connect OBJ to OBJ: connect electrical components disconnect OBJ: disconnect electrical components use OBJ [on OBJ]: use a device/item look around: describe the current room

examine OBJ: describe an object in detail look at OBJ: describe a container’s contents read OBJ: read a note or book move OBJ to OBJ: move an object to a container pick up OBJ: move an object to the inventory pour OBJ into OBJ: pour a liquid into a container mix OBJ: chemically mix a container teleport to LOC: teleport to a specific room focus on OBJ: signal intent on a task object wait: task no action for 10 steps wait1: task no action for a step

Interact with a household to solve a task. Imagine you are an intelligent agent in a household environment and your target is to perform actions to complete the task goal. At the beginning of your interactions, you will be given the detailed description of the current environment and your goal to accomplish. For each of your turn, you will be given the observation of the last turn. You should choose from two actions: "Thought" or "Action". If you choose "Thought", you should first think about the current condition and plan for your future actions, and then output your action in this turn. Your output must strictly follow this format:"Thought: your thoughts.\n Action: your next action"; If you choose "Action", you should directly output the action in this turn. Your output must strictly follow this format:"Action: your next action". The available actions are:

- 1. go to recep
- 2. take obj from recep
- 3. put obj in/on recep
- 4. open recep
- 5. close recep
- 6. toggle obj recep
- 7. clean obj with recep
- 8. heat obj with recep
- 9. cool obj with recep

where obj and recep correspond to objects and receptacles. After your each turn, the environment will give you immediate feedback based on which you plan your next few steps. if the envrionment output "Nothing happened", that means the previous action

is invalid and you should try more options. Reminder:

- 1. The action must be chosen from the given available actions. Any actions except provided available actions will be regarded as illegal.
- 2. Think when necessary, try to act directly more in the process.

# Good Meta Plan

Meta Plan: Step 1: go to sofa. Step 2: go to sidetable. Step 3: take pillow from sidetable. Step 4: go to sofa. Step 5: put pillow in/on sofa. Step 6: go to sidetable. Step 7: take another pillow from sidetable. Step 8: go to sofa. Step 9: put second pillow in/on sofa.

Meta Plan: Step 1: go to where the first pillow may be located. Step 2: take first pillow. Step 3: go to where sofa is. Step 4: put first pillow in/on sofa. Step 5: go to where the second pillow may be located. Step 6: take second pillow. Step 7: go back to sofa. Step 8: put second pillow in/on sofa.

Thought: To solve the task, I need to find two pillow and put them in sofa. The meta plan suggests that I should go to sofa first, then go to sidetable.

Thought: A pillow is more likely to appear in armchair (1), cabinet (1-4), drawer (1-5), dresser (1), shelf (1-12), sofa (1). I can check one by one, starting with armchair 1.

Action: go to sofa Observation: Nothing happens.

Action: go to armchair 1 Observation: On the armchair 1, you see a pillow 2, a pillow 1, and a remotecontrol 1.

Thought: It seems that the action "go to sofa" is invalid. I can try to go to sofa again, or I can try to go to sidetable first.

Thought: Now I find the first pillow (1). Next, I need to take it. I can find the second pillow (2) later in armchair 1.

Action: go to sidetable Observation: Nothing happens.

Thought: It seems that the action "go to sidetable" is also invalid. I can try to go to sofa again, or I can try to go to a cabinet or a drawer instead.

Action: take pillow 1 from armchair 1 Observation: You pick up the pillow 1 from the armchair 1.

Thought: Now I take the first pillow (1). Next, I need to put it in/on sofa. I can directly go to sofa.

Action: go to cabinet 1 Observation: The cabinet 1 is closed.

Thought: Now that I am in front of the cabinet 1, I can try to open it to see if there are any pillow inside.

Action: go to sofa 1 Observation: On the sofa 1, you see nothing.

Thought: Now I go to sofa. Next, I need to put the first pillow in/on sofa. I can directly put the first pillow in/on sofa.

Action: open cabinet 1 Observation: You open the cabinet 1. The cabinet 1 is open. In it, you see a tissuebox 1. Thought: It seems that there is no pillow in the
