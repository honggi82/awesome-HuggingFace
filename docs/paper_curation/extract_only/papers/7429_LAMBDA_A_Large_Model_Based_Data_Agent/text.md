###### Abstract

We introduce LArge Model Based Data Agent (LAMBDA), a novel open-source, code-free multi-agent data analysis system that leverages the power of large language models. LAMBDA is designed to address data analysis challenges in data-driven applications through innovatively designed data agents using natural language. At the core of LAMBDA are two key agent roles: the programmer and the inspector, which are engineered to work together seamlessly. Specifically, the programmer generates code based on the user’s instructions and domain-specific knowledge, while the inspector debugs the code when necessary. To ensure robustness and handle adverse scenarios, LAMBDA features a user interface that allows direct user intervention. Moreover, LAMBDA can flexibly integrate external models and algorithms through our proposed Knowledge Integration Mechanism, catering to the needs of customized data analysis. LAMBDA has demonstrated strong performance on various data analysis tasks.

### 1 Introduction

Over the past decade, the data-driven approach utilizing deep neural networks has driven the success of artificial intelligence across many challenging applications in various fields (LeCun et al., 2015). Despite these advancements, the current paradigm encounters challenges and limitations in statistical and data science applications, particularly in domains such as biology (Weissgerber et al., 2016), healthcare (Oakes et al., 2024), and business (Weihs and Ickstadt, 2018), which require extensive expertise and advanced coding knowledge for data analysis. A significant barrier is the lack of effective communication channels between domain experts and sophisticated AI models (Park et al., 2021). To address this issue, we introduce a Large Model Based Data Agent (LAMBDA), which is a new open-source, code-free multi-agent data analysis system designed to overcome this dilemma. LAMBDA aims to create a much-needed medium, fostering seamless interaction between domain knowledge and the capabilities of AI in statistics and data science. Our main objectives in developing LAMBDA are as follows.

- (a) Crossing coding barrier: Coding has long been recognized as a significant barrier

for domain experts without a background in statistics or computer science, preventing them from effectively leveraging powerful AI tools for data analysis (Oakes et al., 2024). LAMBDA addresses this challenge by enabling users to interact with data agents through natural language instructions, thereby offering a coding-free experience. This approach significantly lowers the barriers to entry for tasks in data science, such as data analysis and data mining, while simultaneously enhancing efficiency and making these tasks more accessible to professionals across various disciplines.

- (b) Integrating human intelligence and AI: The existing paradigm of data analysis

is confronted with a challenge due to the lack of an efficient intermediary that connects human intelligence with artificial intelligence (Park et al., 2021). On one hand, AI models often lack an understanding of the unlearned domain knowledge required for specific tasks. On the other hand, domain experts find it challenging to integrate their expertise into AI models to enhance their performance (Dash et al., 2022). LAMBDA provides a possible solution to alleviate this problem. With a well-designed interface in our key-value (KV)

knowledge base, the agents can access external resources like algorithms or models. This integration ensures that domain-specific knowledge is effectively incorporated, meets the need for customized data analysis, and enhances the agent’s ability to perform complex tasks with higher accuracy and relevance.

##### (c) Reshaping data science education: LAMBDA has the potential to become an

interactive platform that can transform statistical and data science education. It offers educators the flexibility to tailor their teaching plans and seamlessly integrate the latest research findings. This adaptability makes LAMBDA an invaluable tool for educators seeking to provide cutting-edge, personalized learning experiences. Such an approach stands in contrast to the direct application of models like GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023; Tu et al., 2024), offering a unique and innovative educational platform.

Beyond these features, the design of LAMBDA also emphasizes reliability and portability. Reliability refers to LAMBDA’s ability to handle data analysis tasks stably and automatically address failures. Portability ensures that LAMBDA is compatible with various large language models (LLMs), allowing it to be continuously enhanced by the latest state-of-the-art models. To save users time on tasks such as document writing, LAMBDA is equipped with the capability for automatic analysis report generation. To accommodate diverse user needs, LAMBDA also supports exporting code to IPython notebook files, such as “ipynb” files in Jupyter Notebook.

While GPT-4 has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in advanced data analysis, its closed-source nature constrains its adaptability to the rapidly expanding needs of statistical and data science applications and specialized educational fields. Furthermore, concerns regarding data privacy and security risks are inherent in the present configuration of GPT-4 (Bavli et al., 2024). In contrast, by utilizing the open-source LAMBDA, users can alleviate concerns about data privacy by preventing the transmission of user data to external servers. Additionally, it offers greater flexibility and convenience in integrating domain knowledge, installing packages, and utilizing various computational resources.

LAMBDA demonstrates exceptional performance across various datasets used in our system testing. Moreover, it outperforms other data agents in handling complex domain

tasks during our experiments. In summary, our main contributions are as follows: We propose a well-engineered architecture for an LLM-based data agent that enables natural language-driven data analysis in a conversational manner. Unlike typical end-to-end data agents, our design allows human intervention throughout the process, ensuring adaptability when the agent fails to complete a task or misinterprets user intent. Moreover, we introduce a Knowledge Integration mechanism to effectively handle tasks requiring domain-specific knowledge, providing greater flexibility when misalignment occurs in the knowledge. Its ongoing development has the potential to enhance statistics and data science, making advanced tools more accessible to diverse users.

This paper begins with the background and related works in Section 2. Section 3 provides a detailed description of the proposed LAMBDA method. To evaluate its effectiveness, we present our experiments and results in Section 4. Section 5 demonstrates examples and cases of LAMBDA’s application in various scenarios, including data analysis, integration of human intelligence, and interactive education. The paper concludes with a summary in Section 6. More information and details, including implementation, some discussions, datasets, case studies, and experimental settings, are provided in the Supplementary Materials.

### 2 Background and related works

In recent years, the rapid progress in LLMs like GPT-3, GPT-4, PaLM, LLaMA, and Qwen (Brown et al., 2020; OpenAI, 2023; Chowdhery et al., 2022; Touvron et al., 2023; Bai et al., 2023) has brought boundless possibilities to the field of artificial intelligence and its applications in many fields, including statistics and data science. Benefiting from this revolution, LLM-powered agents (LLM agents) are developed to automatically solve problems in various domains like the search engine, software engineering, gaming, and data science (Guo et al., 2024; Hong et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2023; Hong et al., 2023).

#### 2.1 LLMs as data analysis agents

LLM-based data science agent, or data agent, is dedicated to harnessing the power of LLMs to automate data science and analysis tasks (Sun et al., 2024). For example, GPT-4Advanced Data Analysis and ChatGLM-Data Analysis can analyze user’s data files, perform computations, and generate visualizations (OpenAI, 2023). Some works integrate LLMs into Jupyter Notebooks. For instance, MLCopilot (Zhang et al., 2023) and Chapter (Chapyter, 2023), enable users to interact directly with the notebook, greatly enhancing flexibility. However, they cannot automatically fix errors when they occur and require additional magic commands to support natural language input.

Meanwhile, some researchers focus on designing end-to-end data agents to automate the entire pipeline, including data preprocessing and model evaluation, without human intervention. For example, Data Interpreter (Hong et al., 2024) and TaskWeaver (Qiao et al., 2023) accomplish their tasks through planning and iterative steps. However, current state-of-the-art LLM/VLM-based agents do not reliably automate complete data science workflows (Cao et al., 2024). While fully relying on LLMs for each step reduces human effort, it also significantly increases instability and uncertainty. In addition, if any intermediate step does not align with the user’s intent, the process must be repeated, potentially leading to token waste. In contrast, LAMBDA is designed to support a human-agent collaboration mode, allowing for human intervention at any stage of the process if necessary.

Furthermore, these works have not adequately addressed the high degree of user flexibility needed in data analysis, such as the integration of custom algorithms or statistical models according to user preferences. This flexibility is crucial for enhancing data analysis tasks in domain-specific applications and in statistical and data science education. To address this gap, we have designed a Knowledge Integration Mechanism that allows for the easy incorporation of user resources into our agent system.

#### 2.2 Multi-agent collaboration

A multi-agent system consists of numerous autonomous agents that collaboratively engage in planning, discussions, and decision-making, mirroring the cooperative nature of human

group work in problem-solving tasks (Guo et al., 2024). Each agent has unique capabilities, objectives, and perceptions, operating either independently or collectively to tackle complex tasks or resolve problems (Huang et al., 2023a). Hong et al. (2023) proposed MetaGPT, modeled after a software company, consisting of agents such as Product Manager, Architect, Project Manager, Engineer, and QA Engineer, efficiently breaking down complex tasks into subtasks involving many agents working together. However, even for simple tasks like data visualization, MetaGPT consume a large number of tokens and require more time. In addition, they generate engineering files that need manual execution and lack the immediacy and interactivity essential for intuitive data analysis. In contrast, LAMBDA simplifies the collaboration process by involving only two agents to simulates data analysis workflows, programmer and inspector respectively, reducing token and time consumption. Moreover, its well-designed user interface allows users to intuitively view the analysis results directly on the screen. A comparison and discussion can be found in the supplement materials.

#### 2.3 Knowledge integration

Addressing tasks that require domain-specific knowledge presents a significant challenge for AI agents (Zhang et al., 2024). Incorporating knowledge into LLMs through in-context learning (ICL) is a promising strategy for acquiring new information. A well-known technique in this regard is retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) (Gao et al., 2023), which enhances the accuracy and reduces hallucinations of LLM answers by retrieving external sources (Lewis et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2023b; Borgeaud et al., 2022; Mialon et al., 2023). In RAG, resources are divided into sub-fragments, embedded into vectors, and stored in a vector database. The model first queries this database, identifying document fragments relevant to the user’s query based on the similarity. These fragments are then utilized to refine the answers generated by the LLMs through ICL (Lewis et al., 2020). However, deploying a general RAG approach in data analysis introduces specific challenges. First, the user’s instructions may not align closely with the relevant code fragments in the representation space, resulting in inaccurate searches. Second, when dealing with extensive code, the agents might struggle to contextualize the correct code segments, where accuracy and completeness

are essential for codes and final results.

In addition, custom APIs (Hong et al., 2024) can be implemented to handle domainspecific tasks (Qiao et al., 2023; Hong et al., 2024). For example, systems like Data Interpreter and TaskWeaver invoke the corresponding Tools/Plugins directly within the generated code. Compared to direct parameter-passing, this approach offers greater flexibility in tool usage. However, since the agent cannot access the implementation details of these plugins, it is limited to simple plugin usage and may struggle to resolve misalignment between tools and human instructions when plugin usage is inappropriate.

To address these challenges, we develop a specially designed KV knowledge base with integration methods. This allows users to choose between different modes, including ‘Full’ and ‘Core’, based on the complexity, length of the knowledge context, and specific task requirements. By integrating knowledge, our agent system becomes more adaptable to domain-specific tasks, leveraging human expertise more effectively.

### 3 Methodology

Our proposed multi-agent data analysis system, LAMBDA, consists of two agents that cooperate seamlessly to solve data analysis tasks using natural language, as shown in Figure

Programmer

- Figure 1: Overview of LAMBDA. LAMBDA features two core agents: the “programmer” for code generation and the “inspector” for error evaluation. The programmer writes and executes code based on user instructions, while the inspector suggests refinements if errors occur. This iterative process continues until the code is error-free or a maximum number of attempts is reached. A human intervention mechanism allows users to modify and run the code directly when needed.

#### 3.1 Overview

LAMBDA is structured around two core agent roles: the “programmer” and the “inspector,” who are tasked with code generation and error evaluation, respectively. The two agents can be implemented separately using either the same or different LLMs. When users submit an instruction, the programmer agent writes code based on the provided instruction and dataset. This code is then executed within the kernel of the host system. Should any errors arise during execution, the inspector intervenes, offering suggestions for code refinement. The programmer takes these suggestions into account, revises the code, and resubmits it for re-evaluation. This iterative cycle continues until the code runs error-free or a preset maximum number of attempts is reached. In order to cope with adverse situations and enhance its reliability and flexibility, a human intervention mechanism is integrated into the workflow. This feature allows users to modify and run the code directly and intervene

when necessary. The multi-agent collaboration algorithm is demonstrated in Algorithm 1. Algorithm 1 Multi-agent Collaboration. An, Cn are the answer and extracted code by the programmer agent in iteration n. We assume each An contains Cn, otherwise, the programmer’s reply will be returned to the user directly. r is the execution result, E indicates an error, Sn are suggestions provided by the inspector in iteration n, Ch is the code written by a human. The final response is denoted as R.

Require: Pr: Programmer agent Require: I: Inspector agent Require: d: Dataset provided by user Require: ins: Instructions provided by user Require: T: Maximum number of attempts

- 1: n ← 0 ▷ Initialize iteration counter
- 2: Cn ← An, An ← Pr(d,ins) ▷ Extract code and answer by Programmer
- 3: r =

r, success E, error ← execute(Cn) ▷ Code execution, similarly to subsequent r

- 4: while r = E and n < T do ▷ Self-correcting mechanism start
- 5: n ← n + 1
- 6: Sn ← I(Cn−1,E) ▷ Inspector provides suggestions
- 7: Cn ← An,An ← Pr(Cn−1,Sn,E) ▷ Programmer modifies code
- 8: r ← execute(Cn) ▷ Execute modified code
- 9: end while
- 10: if r = E then
- 11: r ← execute(Ch) ▷ Human intervention (Optional)
- 12: R ← Ch ∪ Pr(r) ▷ Final response in natural language
- 13: end if
- 14: R ← Cn ∪ Pr(r) ▷ Final response in natural language

#### 3.2 Programmer agent

The main responsibility of the programmer is to write code and respond to the user. Upon the user’s dataset upload, the programmer receives a tailored system prompt that outlines the programmer’s role, environmental context, and the I/O formats. This prompt is augmented with examples to facilitate few-shot learning for the programmer. Specifically, the system prompt encompasses the user’s working directory, the storage path of the dataset, the dimensions of the dataset, the name of each column, the type of each column, information on missing values, and statistical description.

The programmer’s workflow can be summarized as follows: initially, the programmer

writes code based on instructions from the user or the inspector; subsequently, the program extracts code blocks from the programmer’s output and executes them in the kernel. Finally, the programmer generates a final response based on the execution results and communicates it to the user. This final response consists of a summary and suggestions for the next steps.

#### 3.3 Inspector agent and self-correcting mechanism

The inspector’s role is to provide modification suggestions when errors occur in code execution. The prompt of the inspector includes the code written by the programmer during the current dialogue round and the error messages from the kernel. The inspector will offer actionable revision suggestions to the programmer for code correction. This suggestion prompt contains the erroneous code, kernel error messages, and the inspector’s suggestions. This collaborative process between the two agents iterates several rounds until the code executes successfully or the maximum number of attempts is reached. This self-correcting mechanism enables the programmer and inspector to make multiple attempts in case of error. A case of self-correcting mechanism and released experiment can be found in the Supplementary Materials.

#### 3.4 Integrating human intelligence and AI

Beyond leveraging the inherent knowledge of LLMs, LAMBDA is further enhanced to integrate human intelligence through external resources such as customized algorithms and statistical models from users. As mentioned above, the challenges faced by general RAG methods in data analysis stem from the potential lack of clear correlation between user instructions and code fragments in the representation space, as well as the impact of the length of code fragments. We design a special KV knowledge base for this challenge.

- Figure 2: Knowledge Integration Mechanism in LAMBDA: Knowledge Matching selects codes from the knowledge base by comparing descriptions with the instruction. Two integration modes are available: ‘Full’ mode injects the entire knowledge code into the LLM via ICL, while ‘Core’ mode segments the code into essential usage for ICL and runnable code for back-end execution.

The KV knowledge base is a repository for housing external resources from users in key and value pairs. Specifically, we format the code of resources into key-value pairs: the key represents the resource description, and the value denotes the code. The user’s query will be matched within the knowledge base to select the code with the highest similarity. Figure

- 2 demonstrates the workflow of knowledge matching in LAMBDA. We define the knowledge base as K = {(di,ci) | i = 1,2,...,n}, where di represents the description of the i-th piece of knowledge and ci represents the corresponding source code.

When the user issues an instruction ins, an embedding model F encodes all descriptions in the knowledge base and the ins, such as Sentence-BERT (Reimers and Gurevych, 2019). The embedding tensors for descriptions and instruction are represented by ed

and eins

i

respectively. The cosine similarity between them is calculated to select knowledge with a similarity score greater than a threshold θ, with the highest-scoring match chosen as the relevant knowledge.

Let the embedding function be F, the ed

= F(di),i ∈ {1,2,...,n}, and eins = F(ins). The similarity Si between description and instruction is computed using cosine similarity as

The knowledge k will be embedded in ICL for the LLM to generate answer Aˆ. Formally, given a query q, matched knowledge k, a set of demonstrations D = {(q1,k1,a1),(q2,k2,a2), ...,(qn,kn,an)}, and the LLM M, the model estimates the probability P(a|q,k,D) and outputs the answer Aˆ that maximizes this probability. The final response Aˆ is generated by the model M as Aˆ ← M(q,D).

The matching threshold θ defines the required similarity between a knowledge description and a user instruction, directly influencing the complexity of retrieving relevant knowledge. A higher θ imposes stricter matching criteria, reducing the chance of retrieval, whereas a lower θ increases the probability of identifying a match.

The optimal selection of θ depends on multiple factors. For example, when users aim to incorporate specific knowledge into a task, a lower θ value increases the chance of retrieving the relevant information. Furthermore, the length of the knowledge description plays a critical role, as longer descriptions typically necessitate a lower θ value since user instructions are generally more concise. By default, we recommend setting θ to 0.2. However, this value can be adjusted based on the aforementioned factors to optimize retrieval performance.

By integrating k through ICL, the model effectively combines retrieved domain knowledge

with contextual learning to provide answers that are more accurate. Moreover, LAMBDA offers two integration modes: ‘Full’ and ‘Core’. In the ‘Full’ mode, the entire knowledge is utilized as the context in ICL. In the ‘Core’ mode, the core functions are processed through ICL, while other functions are executed directly in the back-end. This approach allows the agents to focus on modifying the core function directly, without the need to understand or implement the sub-functions within it. The ‘Core’ mode is particularly effective for scenarios involving lengthy code, as it eliminates the need to process the entire code through ICL. These two modes of knowledge integration provide substantial flexibility for handling tasks that require domain-specific knowledge. We evaluate our Knowledge Integration Mechanism in Table 8 through several domain tasks.

In summary, the Knowledge Integration Mechanism empowers LAMBDA to perform domain tasks and offers the flexibility needed to address complex data analysis challenges.

#### 3.5 Kernel, report generation and code exporting

LAMBDA uses IPython as its kernel to manage sequential data processing, where each operation builds on the previous one, such as standardization followed by one-hot encoding. Implementation details are in the Supplementary Materials. LAMBDA also generates analysis reports from dialogue history, including data processing steps, visualizations, model descriptions, and evaluation results. Users can choose from various report templates, and the agent creates reports via ICL, allowing users to focus on higher-value tasks. A sample report is in Figure 9 and the Supplementary Materials. Moreover, users can download their experimental code as an IPython notebook.

#### 3.6 User interface

LAMBDA provides an accessible user experience similar to ChatGPT. Users can upload datasets and describe tasks in natural language, supported by LLMs like Qwen-2, which recognizes 27 languages. It is recommended to prompt LAMBDA step-by-step, mimicking data analysts’ approach, to maintain control and embody the “human-in-the-loop” concept. LAMBDA generates results, including code, figures, and models, which users can copy and

save with a single click. Even those without expertise in statistics or data science can train advanced models by simply asking for recommendations, such as XGBoost and AdaBoost. Advanced users can customize LAMBDA’s knowledge via an interface template. Users can also export text reports and code for further study. A usage example is shown in Figure 9. LAMBDA’s interface is designed to be accessible to users of all backgrounds.

To summarize, the programmer agent, inspector agent, self-correcting mechanism, and human-in-the-loop components collectively ensure the reliability of LAMBDA. The integration of knowledge makes LAMBDA scalable and flexible for domain-specific tasks. To enhance portability, we provide an OpenAI-style interface for LAMBDA. This ensures that most LLMs, once deployed via open-source frameworks such as vLLM (Kwon et al., 2023) and LLaMA-Factory (Zheng et al., 2024b), are compatible with LAMBDA.

#### 3.7 Prompt

We present examples of prompts for the roles of programmer, inspector, self-corrector, and knowledge integrator. Additional prompt examples and case studies are available in the Supplementary Materials.

Figure 3 gives an example prompt for the data analyst at the start of the analysis session.

### 4 Experiments

#### 4.1 Data experiments

The current data analysis paradigm relies on programming software and languages such as R (R Core Team, 2023), SAS (SAS Institute Inc., 2015), and Python (Python Software Foundation, 2023) for computation and experimentation. To gain practical experience and evaluate LAMBDA’s performance in real-world data science tasks, we first applied LAMBDA to several standard datasets for classification and regression analysis. In addition,

we conducted further investigations in broader statistical analysis scenarios, such as highdimensional data, missing data, image data, and text data, to examined its robustness and versatility. All information of the datasets used can be found in the supplementary materials.

For classification problems, we measured accuracy on the test data, defined as the ratio of correctly classified instances to the total number of instances. For regression problems, we used Mean Squared Error (MSE), which is the average of the squared differences between the predicted values and the actual values in the test data. The formula for MSE is: MSE = (1/n) ni=1(yi − yˆi)2, where n is number of data points, yi is the observed value, yˆi is the predicted value. We employed 5-fold cross validation for evaluation in all the cases. Table S.5 lists the datasets used in our experiments and case studies.

##### 4.1.1 Experiments with classical tabular data

We initially applied LAMBDA to several classical datasets, covering both classification and regression tasks. To facilitate comparison, we documented the analysis methods employed by LAMBDA and then manually conducted the same analyses using R. The results are summarized in Table 2, with the corresponding results from the R analyses presented in parentheses.

- Table 2: The experimental results obtained using LAMBDA and R are presented, with the

- R results indicated in parentheses. Classification problems were evaluated using accuracy, where higher values indicate better performance. Regression problems were assessed using mean squared error (MSE), where lower values are preferable. All results were derived from 5-fold cross-validation. The difference result bewteen LAMBDA and R is introduced by different data processing, hyper-paprameters and cross-validation.

The results presented in Table 2 demonstrate LAMBDA’s robust performance in executing data analysis tasks. These results are either superior to or on par with those obtained using R. These outcomes highlight LAMBDA’s effectiveness in leveraging various models

across tabular data scenarios. Furthermore, the results indicate that LAMBDA performs at a level comparable to that of a data analyst proficient in R. This suggests the potential for systems like LAMBDA to become indispensable tools for data analysis in the future. Notably, there was no human involvement in the entire experimental process with LAMBDA,

- as only prompts in English were provided. In summary, the experimental results demonstrate that LAMBDA achieves human-level

performance and can serve as an efficient and reliable data agent, assisting individuals in handling data analysis tasks.

##### 4.1.2 Experiments with high-dimensional data and unstructured data

To validate LAMBDA’s robustness and versatility, we further explored its application across a broader range of data scenarios, including high-dimensional data, missing data, image data, and text data.

- • High-dimensional data: We evaluated LAMBDA on the following three challenging high-dimensional clinical datasets: TCGAmirna (Bentink et al., 2012), EMTAB386 (Colaprico et al., 2015), and GSE49997 (Pils et al., 2012). We summarize the sample size and dimensions in Table 3. The test results are presented in Table 4. More detailed descriptions of these three datasets are given in the Supplementary Materials. We found that LAMBDA consistently applies dimensionality reduction techniques, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), as a preprocessing step. This allows us to apply methods like logistic regression without the regularization. The results indicate that LAMBDA is capable of handling high-dimensional data.

Table 3: Experiment datasets with their sizes and dimensions (rows, columns).

- • Missing data: We evaluated LAMBDA on three datasets containing missing values, with results summarized in Table 5. We observe that LAMBDA tends to prioritize deleting the observations that contain missing values. However, with an appropriate

prompt, LAMBDA can also attempt to impute missing values (e.g., mean value). When errors arise due to missing values, the Inspector agent effectively identifies the issue, notifies the Programmer agent, and applies the necessary corrections.

- Table 5: Performance on Framingham, StuRecord and Heart Disease datasets. The results are reported in terms of accuracy through 5-fold cross-validation.

- • Image data: We used LAMBDA to train a handwritten digit classifier based on the MNIST dataset. We prompted LAMBDA to utilize various neural network architectures, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers, as backbone models. The results of this experiment are presented in Table 6. According

to Table 6, we find LAMBDA can effectively implement and apply deep learning architectures like CNNs and Transformers for image classification tasks.

Model Accuracy (%) CNN 99.19 Transformer 97.23

Table 6: Performance on the MNIST Dataset.

- • Text data: We used LAMBDA to train a spam detection classifier based on the SMS Spam Collection Dataset. Similar to our approach with image data, we prompted LAMBDA to experiment with different backbone models for this task. The results are summarized in Table 7. As shown in Table 7, LAMBDA successfully performed text classification tasks. Notably, when prompted to use a Transformer-based architecture, LAMBDA employed DistilBERT-Base-Uncased for transfer learning, which significantly improved both training efficiency and model performance.

Model Accuracy (%) Multinomial Naive Bayes 98.39 BERT 99.37

Overall, our findings indicate that LAMBDA is not only capable of handling tabular tabular tasks but also effectively processing image and text data. In future work, we aim to explore more complex and diverse data scenarios.

#### 4.2 Performance of Knowledge Integration

We collected three domain-specific tasks to evaluate the proposed Knowledge Integration Mechanism and compare it with advanced data analysis agents. Specifically, the tasks involve utilizing the recent algorithm packages (e.g., PAMI (Piotrowski et al., 2021)), implementing optimization algorithms (e.g., computing the nearest correlation matrix), and training the

latest research models (e.g., non-negative neural networks). For each task, we define a score

- S that is calculated as follows:



- 0, code error and execution error, or exceeded runtime limit, 0.5, code error and execution successful, 0.8, code successful, execution error due to other issues, e.g. environment,
- 1, both code and execution successful.



S =



To ensure maximum alignment in experimental settings, we converted the code into corresponding tools for agents equipped with a tools mechanism. For agents lacking such a mechanism, we directly included the code in their context. All agents are implemented using GPT-3.5, except for methods and platforms that have their own models, such as GPT4-Advanced Data Analysis, ChatGLM-Data Analysis, and OpenCodeInterpreter. Since each task can be completed within one minute, we set a maximum runtime limit of 5 minutes to prevent some agents from becoming stuck in infinite self-modification loops.

- • Pattern Mining Piotrowski et al. (2021) introduce PAMI (PAttern MIning), a cross-platform, open-source Python library offering algorithms to uncover patterns in diverse databases across multiple computing architectures.
- • Nearest Correlation Matrix Qi and Sun (2006) propose a Newton-type method specifically designed for the nearest correlation matrix problem. Numerical experiments validate the method’s fast convergence and high efficiency.
- • Fixed Points Non-negative Neural Networks Rage et al. (2024) analyze nonnegative neural networks, which are defined as neural networks that map nonnegative vectors to nonnegative vectors.

Table 8 demonstrates the effectiveness of LAMBDA’s Knowledge Integration mechanism. Specifically, our results showed that many methods scored zero, particularly when the code was lengthy or involved unfamiliar packages not encountered during LLM training. In these

- Table 8: Performance of the Knowledge Integration Mechanism. In the table, ‘PM’ refers to pattern mining, ‘NCM’ refers to the nearest correlation matrix, and ‘FPNENN’ stands for fixed points in non-negative neural networks. The values represent the performance scores, with failure reasons noted in brackets. Specifically, 1: code error and execution error; 2: exceeded runtime limit; 3: code error but successful execution; 4: right code but execution error due to other issues; 5: right code and successful execution.

situations, most other approaches struggle with one-shot learning. Two exceptions are Data Interpreter and TaskWeaver, which successfully complete the task using pre-defined Plugins/Tools. With the pre-defined Plugins/Tools, they can execute operations internally without requiring the LLM to generate precise code. This mechanism is similar to the ‘Core’ mode of our LAMBDA.

With these tools, the LLM only needs to learn a given code usage example rather than generating the full internal implementation, even when it has access to those details. Although these approaches are generally suitable, the agent is likely to make mistakes when there is the certain misalignment between the users’ instructions and integrated knowledge. In such circumstances, we need to utilize the ‘Full’ mode of our LAMBDA. To further support our claim, we designed two additional experiments.

We take the fixed point non-negative neural networks as a example. We further explore the following two cases that involve misalignment in integrating knowledge/tools and human instruction, which require modifications to the tools (the loss and network mapping are annotated in the schema):

- • Case 1: The instruction specifies the use of L1 Loss, whereas the tool are originally

- configured with MSE Loss.
- • Case 2: The instruction specifies a network structure mapping as follows:

- – Encoder: 784 → 400, whereas 784 → 200 originally configured.
- – Decoder: 400 → 784, whereas 200 → 784 originally configured.

Methods Misalignment Loss Misalignment Network TaskWeaver (Plugins) ✗ Directly using the plugin ✗ Directly using the plugin Data Interpreter (Tools) ✗ Directly use the tool ✗ Directly use the tool LAMBDA (Knowledge) ✔ Alignment ✔ Alignment

- Table 9: The results of case study on Misalignment between Tools and Instructions. Both Plugins and Tools Integration directly use the tools and are not aware of the Misalignment between Tools and Instructions.

From Table 9, we observe that in Cases 1 and 2, which require modifications to the tools, both TaskWeaver and Data Interpreter directly use the original tools without recognizing that the tools no longer meet the new requirements although the loss and network mapping are annotated in the schema. In contrast, due to the visibility of the knowledge code under ‘Full’ mode, LAMBDA identifies that the original code cannot satisfy the new requirements, makes the necessary adjustments, and successfully completes the two cases.

### 5 Examples

We present an example of using LAMBDA for building a classification model in Figure 9. We also provide three case studies in video format to demonstrate the use of LAMBDA in data analysis, integrating human intelligence and AI, and education.

- • Data Analysis We simulate scenarios in which the user requests LAMBDA to perform various tasks, including data preprocessing, data visualization, and model training, on the provided Iris dataset (Fisher, 1988). LAMBDA consistently delivers accurate responses. Additionally, LAMBDA generates an analysis report based on the chat history. A demonstration of this process is given in the first video at https://www.polyu.edu.hk/ama/cmfai/lambda.html.

- • Integrating Human Intelligence and AI We demonstrated the Knowledge Integration capabilities of LAMBDA by computing the nearest correlation matrix using the Quadratically Convergent Newton Method. We first highlighted the limitations of GPT-4-Advanced Data Analysis in performing this task, thereby underscoring the value of LAMBDA through comparison. A demonstration is given in the second video at https://www.polyu.edu.hk/ama/cmfai/lambda.html.
- • Interactive Education We consider an educational scenario in which the teacher uses LAMBDA to design the exercise assignments, and the students use LAMBDA to complete exercises. The exercise dataset used is Abalone. This educational support system enhances the efficiency of both teaching and learning. A demonstration is given in the third video at https://www.polyu.edu.hk/ama/cmfai/lambda.html.

### 6 Conclusion

LAMBDA is an open-source multi-agent data analysis system that effectively integrates human intelligence with artificial intelligence. Experimental results demonstrate that LAMBDA achieves satisfactory performance in handling various data analysis tasks. In the future, LAMBDA can be further enhanced with advanced planning, reasoning techniques, and knowledge integration methods to address a broader range of domain-specific tasks. Our results and examples underscore the significant potential of LAMBDA to enhance both statistical and data science practice and education.

By bridging the gap between human expertise and AI capabilities, LAMBDA aims to democratize data science and statistical analysis, fostering a more inclusive environment for innovation and discovery. Its open-source nature encourages collaboration and continuous improvement from the global research community, allowing researchers and developers to contribute to its evolution. As LAMBDA continues to develop, it has the potential to become an invaluable tool for statisticians, data scientists, and domain experts, enhancing their ability to analyze data efficiently and effectively.

Moreover, LAMBDA holds significant potential for statistical and data science education. Its natural language interface lowers barriers for educators and students, enabling them to focus on problem formulation rather than getting bogged down by syntactic complexities. By generating executable code for various tasks, LAMBDA provides immediate, actionable feedback, which can enhance the learning experience by allowing students to see the direct impact of their queries and hypotheses. This capability not only aids in teaching fundamental concepts but also empowers students to experiment and explore data-driven insights independently.

Future work on LAMBDA could focus on several key areas. First, enhancing LAMBDA’s ability to seamlessly integrate and leverage large models from various domains for statistical analysis could significantly improve its capacity to tackle complex data analysis tasks. Second, improving the user interface and increasing user satisfaction would make the system more accessible to non-experts. Third, incorporating real-time data processing capabilities could enable LAMBDA to handle streaming data, which is increasingly important in many

applications. Finally, expanding the system’s support for collaborative work among multiple users could further enhance its utility in both educational and professional settings. We plan to implement LAMBDA in our classroom teaching scenarios, continuously gather feedback from various groups, and use user satisfaction as a metric for evaluating LAMBDA.

In conclusion, LAMBDA represents a meaningful step forward in integrating human and artificial intelligence for data analysis. Its continued development and refinement have the potential to advance the fields of statistics and data science, making sophisticated analytical tools more accessible to users from diverse backgrounds.

### Supplementary Materials

The Supplementary Materials provide key methodological details, experimental data, case studies, and the experimental setup. Specifically, Section A introduces our initial concept of a function-calling-based agent system along with relevant discussions. Section B details the core modules involved in kernel development and describes the datasets used in our experiments. Section C elaborates on the implementation of the Knowledge Base and Knowledge Integration. In Section D, we analyze the distinctions between LAMBDA and related approaches, including MetaGPT and ChatGPT-Advanced Data Analysis. Section E presents additional details on the datasets, while Section F presents multiple case studies, demonstrating LAMBDA’s capabilities in data analysis, self-correction mechanisms, human intelligence integration, educational applications, and report generation. Finally, Section G outlines the experimental setup.

### A Function Calling Based Agent System

Our initial idea was to implement function calling. We developed extensive APIs that encompass a wide range of data processing and machine learning functionalities, including statistical descriptions (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation), encoding schemes (e.g., one-hot encoding, ordinal encoding), data partitioning, and model training (e.g., logistic regression, decision tree). We utilized five function libraries to build these APIs, each tailored for different purposes: the Data Description Library, Data Visualization Library, Data Processing Library, Modeling Library, and Evaluation Library. Each library caches variables such as processed data and models throughout the program’s lifecycle. The framework and workflow are illustrated in Figure S.1.

We implemented the function calling service by ReAct. Specifically, when prompted to generate text up to the “Observation” section, the LLM should halt generation at this point. This is essential as the “Observation” section requires the outcome of API execution to prevent LLMs from generating results autonomously. The details are depicted in Figure S.2.

Figure S.1: Agent system design by the function calling method. The FCL means function calling library.

However, during the implementation, we found the function calling based data agent have some drawbacks and are engineering impractical.

- • The function-calling method requires APIs to be pre-defined in advance. It is easy to imagine that the number of APIs required for statistical analysis and data processing across various scenarios is virtually limitless, making this approach impractical.
- • In applications, a large number of APIs are typically required. These APIs often have complex interrelationships and extensive annotations. Such lengthy API annotations can result in sequences that exceed the maximum processing capacity of current LLMs, leading to the truncation of context.
- • The model’s ability to accurately select APIs diminishes as the number of available APIs increases. This decline is due to the increased complexity introduced by the growing number of APIs that LLMs need to evaluate. An incorrect choice of tools or models can directly lead to erroneous results and answers.

Building upon these conjections, we have designed some experiments to verify it.

Answer the following questions as best you can. You have access to the following APIs: [

{ "name": "show_data_head", "description": "Show top n row of data.", "parameters": { "type": "object", "properties": { "row": { "type": "string", "description": "number of rows to show." } } } }, ...

#### A.1 Challenges of the function-calling method

We estimate the maximum number of APIs that some open-source LLMs can handle in data analysis by using the average length of the pre-defined APIs. Figure S.3 illustrates the results. Qwen1.5 and Mistral-v0.1 were specifically designed to handle lengthy sequences, capable of managing 400 and 372 APIs, respectively. However, general-purpose LLMs such as LLaMA2, LLaMA3, Mistral-V0.2, Qwen1, ChatGLM2, and ChatGLM3 can process fewer than 100 APIs. This limitation poses a challenge for applications requiring a larger number of APIs, such as data analysis tasks.

- Figure S.3: Average token length for one API and maximum number of APIs each LLM can process.

To investigate the impact of the number of APIs on the accuracy of LLMs in selecting the correct APIs, we constructed a dataset comprising 100 commonly used APIs in data analysis. Using few-shot learning, we generated 880 testing instructions aligned with these APIs using Qwen1.5-110B. We then segmented both the APIs and testing instructions into intervals of 10 functions for analysis. The details of the evaluation dataset are shown in Table S.1, and the results are presented in Figure S.4.

- Table S.1: Number of APIs and corresponding instructions in the evaluation dataset.

The results of API selection indicate a notable decline in the model’s ability to accurately select APIs as the number of APIs increases. In the data science scenario, the number of APIs can be extensive due to it encompassing various processing methods and combinations.

In summary, the function-calling method exhibits several significant drawbacks. Firstly,

the labor-intensive process of defining numerous APIs is engineeringly impractical. Secondly, the static nature of APIs hinders adaptability to diverse and evolving user demands. Thirdly, extensive API annotations can occupy a substantial portion of the input sequence, potentially leading to truncation risks. Lastly, as the number of APIs increases, the model’s accuracy in correct selection decreases, thereby introducing potential inaccuracies in results.

#### A.2 Evaluation of the inspector agent

To assess the importance of the inspector agent in LAMBDA, we designed an ablation study using the heart disease dataset. This dataset, which contains missing values, naturally presents challenges. We utilized Qwen1.5-110B to generate instructions for related tasks. After filtering, there were 454 instructions in the experiment. We evaluated the execution pass rate with only a single agent (programmer) and two agents (programmer and inspector), respectively. The execution pass rate is a metric used to evaluate the reliability and effectiveness of a system, process, or code. It is calculated as:

Execution Pass Rate =

Nsuccess Ntotal × 100%

where Nsuccess is the number of successful executions and Ntotal is the total number of executions attempted. The results are summarized in Table S.2.

- Table S.2: Experiment on single agent versus multiple agents. The percentages in brackets are the improvement rate over the single agent. Both the programmer and inspector agent are implemented by Qwen1.5-32b in this experiment.

Agents Passing Rate % programmer agent only 68.06

programmer + inspector 95.37 (40.13%)

The result shows a significant gap in the passing rate between using a programmer agent alone and incorporating an inspector. The programmer agent achieved a passing rate of 68.06%, while the integration of the inspector increased the passing rate to 95.37%, marking a substantial improvement of 40.13% over the single-agent setup. This experiment verified the crucial role of collaborative agents in enhancing the reliability and robustness of LAMBDA. By leveraging complementary strengths in error suggestion and correction, the multi-agent collaboration approach not only improves the code passing rate but also reduces the frequency of human intervention in executing data analysis tasks.

### B Implementation of Kernel

The CodeKernel is designed to facilitate the execution of code within a Jupyter Notebook environment. It interacts with the Jupyter backend kernel to manage code execution, handle errors, and oversee the lifecycle of the kernel. This class provides an interface for executing code in a controlled manner, ensuring that outputs are captured and processed effectively.

#### B.1 Constructor

The constructor of the CodeKernel class initializes an instance of the kernel kernel name, kernel id, kernel config path, python path, ipython path, init file path, and verbose.

The initialization process involves setting up environment variables based on the specified paths for Python or IPython, which are crucial for ensuring the correct execution context.

The kernel is initialized using the KernelManager from the jupyter client library, allowing for granular control over the kernel’s operations. Depending on whether a configuration file is provided, the kernel is either started with the given settings or defaults are applied. The constructor also provides detailed logging of the kernel’s connection information if verbosity is enabled.

- B.2 Code execution

The execute method is the primary mechanism for running code within the initialized kernel environment. This method sends a code string to the kernel for execution, utilizing a blocking client to ensure that the process completes before continuing. The method retrieves both shell messages and IOPub messages, which contain critical information about the execution status and outputs.

Outputs are processed to handle standard output (stdout), errors (stderr), and other response types from the kernel. The method returns a tuple consisting of the shell message and a list of processed output messages. This design allows for comprehensive handling of multi-line outputs and ensures that the relevant results are captured and returned.

- B.3 Interactive execution The execute interactive method facilitates the execution of code in an interactive manner, where outputs are immediately accessible to the user. This method ensures that the code execution is monitored closely, with specific handling for timeout scenarios. If the verbose flag is set, the method provides detailed output about the execution process, aiding in debugging and analysis.

- B.4 Code inspection

The inspect method allows for the introspection of code by sending it to the kernel and retrieving detailed information about variables, functions, and other elements within the code. This method is particularly useful for debugging, as it provides real-time insights into

the structure and behavior of the code being executed. The inspection results are returned as part of the shell message, which can be further processed or displayed.

- B.5 Error handling The get error msg and check msg methods are responsible for handling errors that occur during code execution. The get error msg method extracts detailed error messages from the kernel’s response, ensuring that these messages are accessible for debugging purposes. The check msg method evaluates the status of the execution and prints error traces if any issues are detected, providing a clear indication of what went wrong during the execution.

- B.6 Kernel management The CodeKernel class includes several methods for managing the lifecycle of the kernel:

- • shutdown: This method stops both the backend kernel and the associated code kernel, ensuring that all resources are released.
- • restart: This method restarts the kernel, providing a clean slate for subsequent code executions.
- • start: This method initializes the code kernel if it is not already running, allowing for new executions.
- • interrupt: This method interrupts a long-running or unresponsive kernel, providing control over runaway processes.
- • is alive: This method checks whether the kernel is active and responsive, offering a way to monitor the kernel’s status.

### C Implementation of Knowledge Base

The key-value knowledge base serves as a repository containing various knowledge files (e.g., Python scripts). Users can extend the knowledge base by defining their own Knw class,

following our provided template and inheriting from the parent class. A typical Knw class includes the following attributes:

- • name: The name of the knowledge.
- • description: A summary outlining the functionality of the knowledge, which can be function illustration, and parameters of the knowledge.
- • mode: The operational mode determines how the knowledge is applied, chosen from [‘core’, ‘full’].
- • theta: A threshold parameter controlling the matching difficulty between user instructions and knowledge entries (optional).
- • core function: If core mode is selected, this field contains a use example illustrating how the knowledge should be applied. If full mode is selected, this field stores the complete implementation of the knowledge.

- • runnable function: If the core mode is selected, this section contains code that can be executed directly in the backend, such as function or class definitions, among other components (optional).

Additionally, the knowledge base allows users to perform maintenance and updates, ensuring the integration remains adaptable to evolving tasks and datasets.

A more clear example of the ’full‘ and ’core‘ mode workflow, which we present two examples from our experiments, is illustrated in Figures S.10 and Figure S.11.

### D Discussion of LAMBDA, MetaGPT and ChatGPTADA

The LLM-based software agents like MetaGPT are designed to automatically build software programs like calculators, games, and websites. In MetaGPT, the workflow is complex since it consists of many roles in the team like product manager, Architect, Project Manager,

Engineer, and QA Engineer with much communication and collaboration in the team. So it usually costs more tokens and times to complete each task. However, the commonly used tasks in statistics and data analysis like drawing figures can be relatively easy to solve and do not need such a complicated process. To show this point, we use an example of a drawing figure. We record the time cost and token cost to show the big gap between the software agent and the data agent.

Time Token

MetaGPT 44.75s 19400 LAMBDA 7.35s 4146

- Table S.3: Time cost and token cost of a plotting task in MetaGPT and LAMBDA. The token cost is based on prompt tokens and completion tokens

The results from Table S.3 show that software agents, such as MetaGPT, incur significant additional token usage and time when handling data analysis tasks, which is unnecessary. A more critical issue is that the output of software agents like MetaGPT consists of engineering files, such as Python scripts, which may require further manual configuration and execution by the user. In contrast, data analysis tasks demand intuitive, immediately interpretable results. Therefore, data agents offer a significant advantage in terms of interactivity within the domain of data analysis.

We also compare LAMBDA and ChatGPT in terms of several important features. The results are given in the Table S.4.

- Table S.4: Comparison of LAMBDA and GPT-4-Advanced Data Analysis. Scalability means the agent can integrate domain knowledge like customized models or algorithms. Portability means the agent model is adapted to other LLMs like LLaMA3 and Qwen. Human-in-the-loop means users can intervene in outcomes.

GPT-4-Advanced Data Analysis LAMBDA

Coding-free ✔ ✔ Scalability ✗ ✔ Portability ✗ ✔ Human-in-the-loop ✗ ✔ Code exporting ✗ ✔ Security lower higher Report generation Inconvenient by prompt Convenient

These experiments show that LAMBDA outperforms GPT-4-Advanced Data Analysis in multiple features, highlighting the advantages of LAMBDA for data analysis tasks.

This encoding will facilitate the use of the variable in various machine learning algorithms and analyses. Now that the target variable is encoded, you can proceed with further data preprocessing, model building, or analysis as needed.

Draw a correlation matrix ```pythonimport seaborn as sns import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # Create a correlation matrix correlation_matrix = data.corr() # Plot the correlation matrix plt.ﬁgure(ﬁgsize=(8, 6)) sns.heatmap(correlation_matrix, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm', cbar=True) plt.title('Correlation Matrix') plt.saveﬁg(‘/xxx/cache/conv_cache/2c23cf4b-31a8-4aeb-8689-13b9fbdfb7fc-2024-04-29/correlation_matrix.png') ``` Execution result: The correlation matrix has been successfully plotted using a heatmap. The heatmap visually represents the correlation coeﬃcients between diﬀerent features in the dataset. This information can be useful for understanding the relationships between the variables and identifying potential multicollinearity. The resulting correlation matrix plot has been saved as a PNG ﬁle, and it provides a clear visualization of the correlations between the features in the dataset. Further analysis or modeling can be informed by the insights gained from this correlation matrix.

- 3 Split the data to train and test with a proportion of 8:2

```python from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Separate the features and the target variable X = data.drop('Species', axis=1) y = data['Species'] # Split the data into training and testing sets X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42) ``` Execution result:

The dataset has been split into training and testing sets with a proportion of 80% for training data and 20% for testing data. This is a common split ratio for training and evaluating machine learning models. The training set (`X_train` and `y_train`) can be used to train the model, while the testing set (`X_test` and `y_test`) can be used to evaluate the model's performance and generalization to new data.

You can now use the `X_train`, `X_test`, `y_train`, and `y_test` datasets for training and evaluating machine learning models.

- 4 Train a logistic regression model and evaluate it by accuracy on the test set.

[Figure 60]

[Figure 61]

[Figure 62]

```python from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Initialize the logistic regression model logreg_model = LogisticRegression(max_iter=1000)

# Train the model on the training data logreg_model.ﬁt(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test data y_pred = logreg_model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model using accuracy accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred) accuracy ``` Execution result: 1.0

The logistic regression model has been trained and evaluated on the test set, yielding an accuracy of 1.0 or 100%. An accuracy of 1.0 indicates that the model predicted the classes of all samples in the test set perfectly.

While achieving a high accuracy is desirable, it is important to consider the possibility of overﬁtting. In this case, the high accuracy on the test set may indicate overﬁtting. It's recommended to further evaluate the model's performance using techniques such as cross-validation, precision-recall analysis, or confusion matrix to gain a deeper understanding of its predictive capabilities.

Additionally, given the small size of the Iris dataset, a high accuracy on the test set is not unexpected. It would be advisable to use more complex datasets for a more realistic assessment of model performance.

# Evaluate the model using accuracy accuracy_svm = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred_svm) accuracy_svm ``` Execution result: 1.0

The support vector machine (SVM) model with a linear kernel has been trained and evaluated on the test set, yielding an accuracy of 1.0 or 100%. Similar to the logistic regression model, an accuracy of 1.0 may indicate overﬁtting.

As mentioned previously, it's advised to further evaluate the model's performance using additional techniques and metrics such as cross-validation, precision-recall analysis, or confusion matrix to gain a more comprehensive understanding of its predictive capabilities.

While high accuracy is desirable, it is important to maintain a critical perspective and consider the potential for overﬁtting in the context of the speciﬁc dataset and model evaluation."

# Make predictions on the test data y_pred_mlp = mlp_model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model using accuracy accuracy_mlp = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred_mlp) accuracy_mlp ``` Execution result: 1.0

The multi-layer perceptron (MLP) model has been trained and evaluated on the test set, resulting in an accuracy of 1.0 or 100%. As with the previous models, achieving an accuracy of 1.0 may indicate potential overﬁtting.

In practice, it is important to critically assess the model's performance using a variety of evaluation metrics and techniques, as well as cross-validation, to ensure a robust assessment.

It's worth considering other evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the model's performance characteristics. Additionally, exploring techniques for optimizing the model's architecture, regularization, and hyperparameters could further enhance its generalization capabilities."

It's important to consider that achieving a high accuracy score on a small and well-structured dataset like the Iris dataset may indicate overﬁtting. Given the perfect accuracy, it's recommended to further evaluate the model's performance using additional techniques such as cross-validation, precision-recall analysis, or confusion matrix to gain a more comprehensive understanding of its predictive capabilities. It's also important to take into account the interpretability of the decision tree model and how it aligns with the speciﬁc requirements of the analysis or application. Further model tuning and exploration of ensemble methods may also be beneﬁcial for improving generalization and ensuring robust performance on new data."

# Make predictions on the test data y_pred_rf = rf_model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model using accuracy accuracy_rf = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred_rf) accuracy_rf ``` Execution result: 1.0

The random forest model has been trained and evaluated on the test set, resulting in an accuracy of 1.0 or 100%. As with previous models, it's important to remain cautious about the potential for overﬁtting when achieving a perfect accuracy score, especially on a small dataset like Iris.

While a high accuracy score is desirable, it's essential to consider the model's generalization to new data. Additional evaluation metrics, crossvalidation, and further analysis of model performance can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the random forest model's capabilities. In addition to accuracy, it would be beneﬁcial to explore other evaluation metrics and techniques such as precision, recall, and F1 score, as well as feature importance analysis, to gain insights into the model's predictive performance and behavior."

| Sex | Length | Diameter | Height | Whole_weight | Shucked_weight | Viscera_weight | Shell_weight | Rings | | --- | ------ | -------- | ------ | ----------- | ------------- | ------------- | ----------- | ------ | | M | 0.455 | 0.365 | 0.095 | 0.5140 | 0.2245 | 0.1010 | 0.150 | 15 | | M | 0.350 | 0.265 | 0.090 | 0.2255 | 0.0995 | 0.0485 | 0.070 | 7 | | F | 0.530 | 0.420 | 0.135 | 0.6770 | 0.2565 | 0.1415 | 0.210 | 9 | | M | 0.440 | 0.365 | 0.125 | 0.5160 | 0.2155 | 0.1140 | 0.155 | 10 | | I | 0.330 | 0.255 | 0.080 | 0.2050 | 0.0895 | 0.0395 | 0.055 | 7 |

The dataset includes information about the sex, physical dimensions, and number of rings for abalones. The 'Rings' column can be used to predict the age of the abalones, as it represents the number of rings on the abalone shell. The next step would be to perform exploratory data analysis to understand the data distribution and relationships between variables. Additionally, feature engineering and model selection for age prediction can be explored.

Encoding column Sex as one-hot vectors and replace original column.

```python # Perform one-hot encoding on the 'Sex' column data = pd.get_dummies(data, columns=['Sex'], drop_ﬁrst=True)

# Display the ﬁrst 5 rows of the updated dataset data.head() ``` Execute result: Here is the rewritten table in markdown format:

| Length | Diameter | Height | Whole_weight | Shucked_weight | Viscera_weight | Shell_weight | Rings | Sex_I | Sex_M | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | 0.455 | 0.365 | 0.095 | 0.5140 | 0.2245 | 0.1010 | 0.150 | 15 | False | True | | 0.350 | 0.265 | 0.090 | 0.2255 | 0.0995 | 0.0485 | 0.070 | 7 | False | True | | 0.530 | 0.420 | 0.135 | 0.6770 | 0.2565 | 0.1415 | 0.210 | 9 | False | False | | 0.440 | 0.365 | 0.125 | 0.5160 | 0.2155 | 0.1140 | 0.155 | 10 | False | True | | 0.330 | 0.255 | 0.080 | 0.2050 | 0.0895 | 0.0395 | 0.055 | 7 | True | False |

The 'Sex' column has been successfully encoded into one-hot vectors, replacing the original column with new columns 'Sex_I' and 'Sex_M'. This transformation will enable the machine learning models to interpret the 'Sex' attribute eﬀectively. The next step would involve splitting the data into features and labels and proceeding with the model training process to predict the age of the abalones.

###### Classiﬁcation Task Using Wine Dataset with Machine Learning Models

- 1. Abstract: This report outlines the process of building and evaluating multiple machine learning models for a classiﬁcation task on the Wine dataset. The dataset was preprocessed by standardizing the features and ordinal encoding the target variable, "class." Various classiﬁcation models were trained, including Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Neural Networks, and ensemble methods like Bagging and XGBoost. Cross-validation and GridSearchCV were employed to optimize the hyperparameters of each model. Logistic Regression achieved an accuracy of 98.89%, while the best-performing models included Random Forest and SVM. The models' performances are compared, and their strengths are discussed, demonstrating the eﬀectiveness of ensemble methods and support vector machines for this task.
- 2. Introduction The task at hand is to perform a classiﬁcation on the Wine dataset, a well-known dataset that contains attributes related to diﬀerent types of wine. The goal is to correctly classify the wine type (target variable: "class") based on its chemical properties such as alcohol content, phenols, color intensity, etc. Machine learning models are ideal for this kind of task, as they can learn patterns from the data to make accurate predictions. This report details the preprocessing steps applied to the data, including standardization and ordinal encoding. It also discusses various machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, SVM, and ensemble models, which were trained and evaluated using cross-validation. Additionally, GridSearchCV was employed to ﬁne-tune model parameters to achieve optimal accuracy.
- 3. Methodology:

- 3.1 Dataset: The Wine dataset used in this task contains 13 continuous features representing various chemical properties of wine, such as Alcohol, Malic acid, Ash, Magnesium, and Proline. The target variable, "class," is categorical and has three possible values, each corresponding to a diﬀerent type of wine. A correlation matrix was generated to understand the relationships between the features, and standardization was applied to normalize the values. The dataset had no missing values.
- 3.2 Data Processing:

- - Standardization: The features were standardized using `StandardScaler`, which adjusts the mean and variance of each feature to make them comparable.
- - Ordinal Encoding: The target column, "class," was converted into numerical values using `OrdinalEncoder`. | | Alcohol | Malicacid | Ash | Alcalinity_of_ash | Magnesium | Total_phenols | Flavanoids | Nonﬂavanoid_phenols | Proanthocyanins | Color_intensity | Hue | 0D280_0D315_of_diluted_wines | Proline | class | | ---- | -------- | --------- | ---- | ----------------- | --------- | ------------- | ---------- | -------------------- | --------------- | --------------- | ---- | ---------------------------- | ------- | ----- | | 0 | 1.518613 | -0.562250 | 0.23 | -1.169593 | 1.913905 | 0.808997 | 1.034819 | -0.659563 | 1.224884 | 0.251717 | 0.36 | 1.847920 | 1.013 | 0 | For visualization, a correlation matrix was generated to show how diﬀerent features correlate with each other and with the target:

[Figure 125]

[Figure 126]

- 3.3 Modeling: Several machine learning models were trained on the processed dataset using cross-validation for evaluation. The models include:

- - Logistic Regression: A linear model suitable for binary and multiclass classiﬁcation tasks.
- - SVM (Support Vector Machine): Known for handling high-dimensional data and eﬀective in non-linear classiﬁcations when using diﬀerent kernels.
- - Neural Network (MLPClassiﬁer): A neural network model was tested with varying hidden layer sizes.
- - Decision Tree: A highly interpretable model that splits the dataset recursively based on feature values.
- - Random Forest: An ensemble of decision trees that reduces overﬁtting by averaging predictions from multiple trees.
- - Bagging: An ensemble method to train multiple classiﬁers on diﬀerent subsets of the dataset.
- - Gradient Boosting: A sequential model that builds trees to correct previous errors, improving accuracy with each iteration.
- - XGBoost: A gradient boosting technique optimized for performance and speed.
- - AdaBoost: An ensemble method that boosts weak classiﬁers by focusing more on incorrectly classiﬁed instances. Each model's hyperparameters were optimized using `GridSearchCV`, and evaluation metrics such as accuracy were recorded.

- 4. Results:

The results of model evaluation are summarized below:

- 5. Conclusion: This report presents the steps and results of performing a classiﬁcation task using various machine learning models on the Wine dataset. Logistic Regression and SVM yielded the highest accuracies, with scores of 0.9889, demonstrating their eﬀectiveness for this dataset. Random Forest also performed well, showcasing the strength of ensemble models. Neural Networks, while versatile, achieved a lower accuracy of 0.8260, indicating the need for further tuning. Overall, the results suggest that SVM and Logistic Regression are suitable choices for this task, but additional models like Random Forest oﬀer competitive performance.
