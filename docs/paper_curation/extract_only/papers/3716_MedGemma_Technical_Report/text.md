# MedGemma Technical Report

###### Google Research and Google DeepMind 1

Artificial intelligence (AI) has significant potential in healthcare applications, but its training and deployment are challenging due to healthcare’s diverse data, complex spectrum of possible tasks, and the need to preserve privacy. Foundation models that perform well on various medical tasks and require less task-specific tuning data are critical to accelerating the development of AI for healthcare applications. In this technical report, we introduce MedGemma, a new collection of medical vision–language foundation models based on Gemma 3 4B and 27B. MedGemma demonstrates advanced medical understanding and reasoning on images and text, significantly exceeding the performance of similar-sized generative models and approaching the performance of task-specific models, while maintaining the general capabilities of the Gemma 3 base models. For out-of-distribution tasks, MedGemma achieves 2.6-10% improvements on medical multimodal question answering, 15.5-18.1% improvements on chest X-ray finding classification, and 10.8% improvement on agentic evaluations compared to the base models. Fine-tuning MedGemma further improves performance in subdomains, reducing errors in electronic health record information retrieval by 50% and reaching comparable performance to existing specialized state-of-the-art methods for pneumothorax classification and histopathology patch type classification. We additionally introduce MedSigLIP, a medically-tuned vision encoder derived from SigLIP. MedSigLIP powers the visual understanding capabilities of MedGemma and, as an encoder, it achieves performance comparable to or better than specialized medical image encoders. Taken together, the MedGemma collection provides a strong foundation of medical image and text capabilities, with potential to significantly accelerate medical research and development of downstream applications. More details about the MedGemma collection, including tutorials and instructions for downloading the model weights, can be found at https://goo.gle/medgemma.

#### 1. Introduction

The landscape of modern healthcare is characterized by the generation and use of an unprecedented volume and diversity of data. Diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring rely on synthesizing information from disparate sources and specialties. Recently developed large multimodal models (LMMs), trained on massive and diverse datasets, exhibit remarkable capabilities in detecting complex patterns, generating coherent text, and processing visual information (Achiam et al., 2023; Alayrac et al., 2022; Chen et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2023, 2024; OpenAI, 2023; Touvron et al., 2023). These capabilities mark a potential paradigm shift in assisting with current workflows and extracting novel insights.

While general-purpose (non-medically tuned) LMMs demonstrate impressively broad abilities, generic models can lack nuanced medical understanding and the ability to interpret and reason about medical data in a robust way (Han et al., 2023; Labrak et al., 2024; Singhal et al., 2023b,c; Toma et al., 2023; Tu et al., 2024; Yang et al., 2024). Recognizing this gap, we created MedGemma, a new suite of open, medically-tuned, vision-language foundation models. These models represent the latest addition to the Health AI Developer Foundations (Kiraly et al., 2024) collection. Built upon the robust architecture of Gemma 3 (Gemma-Team et al., 2025), the MedGemma models are designed to interpret and reason about medical images and text while retaining the strong general-purpose capabilities present in Gemma 3.

- Figure 1 | Overview of the MedGemma model collection featuring the MedSigLIP image encoder, MedGemma 4B Multimodal and MedGemma 27B Text

In this report, we focus on two MedGemma models: a 4B variant that can accept text, images, or both as input, and a 27B variant that is optimized for text-only inputs. Both models output text. MedGemma 4B demonstrates strong performance on Vision Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks compared to prior SOTA models like Med-Gemini (Saab et al., 2024; Yang et al., 2024) despite being considerably smaller. Both MedGemma 4B and 27B are highly competitive on challenging

text-only medical benchmark tasks, including MedQA (Jin et al., 2021), MedMCQA (Pal et al., 2022), PubMedQA (Jin et al., 2019), MMLU Med (Hendrycks et al., 2020), AfriMed-QA (Olatunji et al., 2024), and AgentClinic (Schmidgall et al., 2024) when compared against other open models of similar scale. In addition to these strong out-of-the-box capabilities, we show how performance can be further improved by fine-tuning MedGemma on subdomains like chest X-ray reporting, histopathology classification, and electronic health record information retrieval.

An additional MedGemma variant, a multimodal version of MedGemma 27B, was also developed and is being released along with the other models. More thorough evaluation of this multimodal 27B variant is ongoing and preliminary results can be found in Appendix Section F. Unless otherwise noted in this report, evaluations that reference “MedGemma 27B” refer to the text-only variant of MedGemma 27B.

In addition to the MedGemma models, we describe the standalone MedSigLIP 400M-parameter medical image encoder. MedSigLIP is based on SigLIP-400M (Zhai et al., 2023) and is the same encoder that powers MedGemma’s image interpretation capabilities. When used on its own, MedSigLIP enables data-efficient and zero-shot image classification and retrieval, with performance comparable to or exceeding specialized image encoders.

A high level overview of the released models is shown in Fig. 1. More details about the MedGemma collection, including tutorials and links to download all of the above models, can be found at https: //goo.gle/medgemma.

#### 2. Methods

###### 2.1. Datasets

For general purpose data replay during pretraining, original data mixtures from SigLIP (Zhai et al., 2023) and Gemma 3 (Gemma-Team et al., 2025) were leveraged. The medical training and evaluation datasets largely followed the datasets in Med-Gemini (Yang et al., 2024). In this section, we outline the specific changes or differences in datasets relative to Med-Gemini.

###### 2.1.1. Training datasets

Text-only datasets: For text datasets, we sampled responses and logits from a large IT (instructiontuned) teacher using the train splits of multiple medical QA datasets, including MedQA (Jin et al., 2021), MedMCQA (Pal et al., 2022), PubMedQA (Jin et al., 2019), MedExpQA (Alonso et al., 2024), AfriMed-QA (Olatunji et al., 2024), HealthSearchQA (Singhal et al., 2023a), and LiveQA (Abacha

- et al., 2017). We also sampled responses and logits for approximately 200,000 synthetic medical questions generated by asking the same large IT teacher to generate a new question using 5 randomly sampled questions from the above datasets as examples.

Multimodal datasets: Relative to Med-Gemini, the multimodal capabilities of MedGemma are currently focused on 2D medical images (e.g. X-ray, 2D slices from CT/MRI); 3D volumes and genomic datasets described in Yang et al. (2024) were not included. Additionally, we and others have identified potential data quality issues in PathVQA and MedVQA. Thus, we removed them from the training dataset. We did not include PAD-UFES-20 in the post-training dataset since it focuses on 6-class classification of very specific lesion types, which is not in line with the goal of more general purpose dermatology capabilities and use cases. For the PMC-OA component of the training data, we only included the single panel medical images from PMC-OA for better data quality. Relative to MedGemini we also introduced a larger internal collection for ophthalmology (184,852 more retinal fundus images), dermatology (51,049 more dermatology images with 210 different skin conditions), histopathology (a total of ∼32.5 million patch-text pairs), and radiology data (54,573 more CT 2D

slices, 47,622 more MRI 2D slices). The additional CT and MRI slices utilized for training were curated based on mention of a specific slice associated with abnormal findings in the radiology report.

###### 2.1.2. Data Preprocessing

Our data preparation followed Yang et al. (2024) closely. Image padding and resizing algorithms remain the same, but because the vision encoder is different in Gemma 3, our images were resized to 896×896 instead of 768×768. Following Gemma 3, we use the SentencePiece tokenizer with 262,000 entries. Additionally, for CT images, we preselected three windows and converted them into the RGB color channels of the input image to highlight (1) bone and lung, window-width: 2250, window-level: -100; (2) soft tissue, window-width: 350, window-level: 40; (3) brain, window-width: 80, window-level: 40.

- 2.2. Modeling Methodology

- 2.2.1. Modeling Architecture and Training Infrastructure

The MedGemma model architecture follows Gemma 3 (Gemma-Team et al., 2025) and is compatible with all existing Gemma infrastructure. The vision encoder for Gemma 3 is the 400M variant of the SigLIP encoder (Zhai et al., 2023) and is shared across the different Gemma language model sizes (4B, 27B). The input image resolution is 896×896 with pixel values normalized to [-1, 1]. The language model component also follows Gemma 3, featuring arbitrary image-text interleaving and long context (128k). Similar to Gemma 3, MedGemma was trained on TPUv4, TPUv5e, and TPUv5p, leveraged pre-computed visual tokens for memory saving, and used data and model shardings for multi-pod training.

###### 2.2.2. Model Training

The MedGemma 4B multimodal model utilized all of the following steps while the text-only version of MedGemma 27B leveraged the post-training stage alone.

Vision Encoder Enhancement for MedGemma: To improve the vision encoder’s capability of encoding and distinguishing subtle differences in medical images, we fine-tuned the vision encoder in Gemma 3 (SigLiP-400M) using over 33M medical image-text pairs (635k from various medical modalities and 32.6M histopathology patches) as listed in Table 1. To retain SigLIP’s existing performance, its original training data (e.g., WebLI) were retained and medical data was mixed with 2% weight into the training. While the Gemma 3 vision encoder works with 896×896 resolution, we found that many medical vision tasks worked reasonably well at 448×448 resolution (Table 15). Thus, while the MedGemma 4B image encoder is based on 896×896 resolution for compatibility and consistency with Gemma 3, the released MedSigLIP model is based on 448×448 resolution for more efficient experimentation and adaptation by the community. The 448×448 encoder shares the same model weights as the 896×896 encoder with the only difference being down-sampled positional embeddings to work with fewer input patches from the lower resolution.

Multimodal Decoder Pretraining: After the vision encoder enhancement, the Gemma language model needed to be re-adapted for this new vision encoder, not only for the medical data but also for the general image domain to preserve the visual-language reasoning capabilities. This goal was achieved in the pretraining stage incorporating both the text and interleaved imaging data from the original mixture and the newly introduced medical domain image-text paired data. Notably, we did not introduce further medical text-only data in this step, as the original Gemma 3 mixture was already general-purpose and large-scale. To reduce compute requirements, we continued our pretraining on top of the original Gemma 3 pretrained checkpoints, mixed our medical image data (Table 1) with 10% weight, trained for approximately 5 epochs on the medical mixture given the mixing ratio, and picked the checkpoint based on the validation set performance on chest X-ray report generation, and radiology, dermatology, and ophthalmology visual question answering.

Post-training: The knowledge acquired from pretraining needs to be surfaced as capabilities in the post-training stage. There are two primary post-training components as previously outlined for Gemma 3. The recipes for distillation and reinforcement learning (RL) were the same as in Gemma 3 development with the following additions: (1) Distillation: addition of medical text data during this component to enable further learning in these domains from a large instruction-tuned (IT) teacher. (2) Reinforcement learning: Medical imaging data with paired text was utilized in the RL stage of post-training. For multimodal training, we found that RL enables better generalization compared to supervised fine-tuning, so all multimodal post-training was performed via RL.

#### 3. MedGemma Evaluations

MedGemma was evaluated and compared with other models on five types of medical tasks: text question-answering, image classification, visual question answering, chest X-ray (CXR) report generation, and agentic behavior. We additionally validated MedGemma on several general purpose (non-medical) benchmarks. A high-level overview of tasks and datasets is provided in Table 2 and additional details on each task are below.

###### 3.1. General evaluation approach

Evaluation parameters: Unless reported otherwise, all evaluations that we performed consisted of a single inference run per example. For MedGemma evaluations, a temperature of 0.0 was used on medical benchmarks and the default temperature was used on non-medical benchmarks. For

evaluations of all other models, on all datasets, each model’s default temperature and top-k were used. Due to data privacy and license terms, only publicly available datasets were used in evaluating models involving public APIs (e.g. OpenAI models). In cases where existing literature with performance metrics was available, those values were used and noted (with inclusion criteria for external models described below). For generalist models, we found that giving them a persona in the system message, such as “You are a helpful medical assistant” or “You are a helpful radiology assistant” could improve their performance, we thus added these messages into the evaluation prompts. Detailed prompt usages can be found in Appendix Tables A6 and A7. As the DeepSeek R1 model (DeepSeek-AI, 2025) is a text-only model, it was only evaluated on text benchmarks.

Inclusion of previously published model performance data: Where comparisons to other models were made, we restricted inclusion to models that met the following criteria: a publicly accessible model card (e.g., via Hugging Face or an institutional website); clear and verifiable attribution, including the name and contact information of the responsible individual or institution; explicit licensing terms governing its use; at least one associated technical report or publication for the current or a prior version of the model. These inclusion criteria were chosen to help ensure accountability, transparency, and adherence to sound machine learning practices, such as avoiding test dataset leakage. Additionally, for visual question answering (VQA) comparisons, we only include zero-shot generative evaluations for the most direct and meaningful comparisons (thus excluding few-shot or discriminative, embedding-based approaches for VQA).

###### 3.2. Medical text question-answering

For evaluation of medical and health related capabilities, we used the official, publicly available test splits for MedQA, MedMCQA, PubMedQA, MMLU medical subcategories, AfriMed-QA, and

MedXpertQA (Zuo et al., 2025). AfriMed-QA includes a mix of closed and open questions though we limited evaluations to only the closed multiple choice questions (MCQs). No data from MedXpertQA was used in model training, so it is considered an out-of-distribution (OOD) benchmark.

###### 3.3. Medical image classification

We evaluated medical image classification on three public chest X-ray datasets, as well as private datasets of dermatology, histopathology and retinal fundus images. We measured classification performance using accuracy or macro F1, depending on the dataset, targeting common findings or diagnoses in each modality.

Chest X-rays: Prediction accuracy was evaluated for five conditions in the MIMIC-CXR (Goldberger et al., 2000; Johnson et al., 2019a,c) and CheXpert (Irvin et al., 2019) datasets: atelectasis, cardiomegaly, consolidation, edema, and pleural effusion. Accuracy was evaluated for three conditions in the ChestX-ray14 (CXR14) (Wang et al., 2017) dataset: lung opacity, pneumothorax, and fracture. We used the original condition labels from CheXpert. For MIMIC-CXR, we report performance on two different versions of the test data: (1) using radiologist-adjudicated labels with missing and uncertain labels excluded, as in Yang et al. (2024) and (2) using original labels from Johnson et al. (2019b) with missing and uncertain labels considered to be negative, with the same set of test cases as reported in Hyland et al. (2023). For the CXR14 data set, radiologist-adjudicated labels as described in Majkowska et al. (2020) were used for evaluation. Evaluations on MIMIC-CXR were not performed with the OpenAI o3 model due to data privacy considerations.

Dermatology: “US-Derm MCQA” (Liu et al., 2020) is an internal, de-identified dataset consisting of one image per patient from 1996 patients who were referred to tele-dermatologists by primary care physicians in the United States. There are 136 different skin conditions represented across the images, with ground truth diagnoses provided by dermatologists based on the images and metadata. We converted this dataset into a multiple choice question format where the associated reference condition is included among three other randomly assigned condition labels from the same dataset (four options total per MCQ).

Histopathology: “Path MCQA” is an internal dataset of 450 patches extracted from 354 unique whole slide images associated with specimens from breast cancer, lung cancer, prostate cancer, lymph nodes, and cervical biopsies. These represent test splits (by patient) from several different data sources. Patches comprise magnifications of 5x, 10x, and 20x (2, 1, and 0.5 microns per pixel). A single, multiclass labeling task for each patch was formulated as a multiple choice question, with four to nine possible options per question depending on the tissue type and labeling task associated with the image. These questions focus on identification and grading for breast cancer, prostate cancer, and cervical dysplasia as well as lung cancer histologic classification and histologic sub-typing. Ground truth labels were obtained via annotations provided as region-level labels by US board-certified pathologists (Jaroensri et al., 2022; Nagpal et al., 2019, 2020; Sadhwani et al., 2021).

Ophthalmology: We used the de-identified 45-degree fundus imagery dataset from EyePACS (Cuadros and Bresnick, 2009) as described previously (Yang et al., 2024). We evaluated one image per patient from 3161 patients on clinically-determined 5-class diabetic retinopathy (DR) severity labels, with each task formulated as a multiple choice question with five options: none, mild, moderate, severe or proliferative DR.

###### 3.4. Medical visual question-answering

We measured visual question-answering performance on the radiology SLAKE and VQA-RAD data sets using the average tokenized F1 metric across open and closed QAs, as well as accuracy on the subset

of yes/no questions. For SLAKE, we used the default train/test split, and for VQA-RAD, we used splits from Yang et al. (2024)2 to avoid the train/test image contamination present in the original splits.

###### 3.5. Chest X-ray report generation

The MedGemma 4B pretrained model was used to generate radiology reports from the MIMIC-CXR test set. The pretrained model was chosen here rather than the post-trained model due to the sensitivity to reporting style of metrics like RadGraph F1 (Jain et al., 2021). The pretrained model could better follow the style of MIMIC-CXR, as MIMIC-CXR reports are used in training, while the post-trained model conformed more closely to the original Gemma 3 style in terms of report generation.

We measured accuracy of chest X-ray report generation on the MIMIC-CXR dataset by comparing MedGemma-generated reports to the original radiologist reports for both impression and findings using the RadGraph F1 metric (Jain et al., 2021) on the 912 image set used in Tanno et al. (2024) and Yang et al. (2024).

We also performed a human expert evaluation on the same 306-case image set as in Yang et al. (2024) with a US board-certified cardiothoracic radiologist to evaluate both the original and MedGemma-generated reports with respect to the associated chest X-ray image. The evaluation task compared the reports on a five-point scale, as originally described in Yang et al. (2024) and shown in Appendix Table A1. Although the reviewer was asked to remain neutral in their evaluation, they were not blinded to which report was from the original radiologist vs. from the AI system. This evaluation complements the automated RadGraph-based evaluation as it can both distinguish between major and minor issues as well as account for scenarios in which the original MIMIC-CXR report contains errors or omissions.

###### 3.6. Medical agentic behavior

To provide insights into the capabilities of MedGemma in more complex environments, we measured the ability of MedGemma to operate in an agentic setting. We evaluated on AgentClinic (Schmidgall et al., 2024), which positions MedGemma in the role of a “physician agent” in a simulated clinical environment. Solving tasks in AgentClinic required the model to perform dialogue-driven patient history taking, ordering and interpreting medical exams, and operating under incomplete information in order to accurately provide a final diagnosis. We evaluated on 415 simulated cases using the text-only environments, AgentClinic-MedQA (215 cases) and AgentClinic-MIMIC-IV (200 cases), which are derived from MedQA (Jin et al., 2021) and MIMIC-IV (Johnson et al., 2023) respectively.

###### 3.7. General purpose benchmarks

Given the limitations that many specialized medical models exhibit when faced with non-medical tasks, we also evaluated possible tradeoffs of specialization by evaluating on the MMLU Pro, Global MMLU Lite, and MMMU benchmarks. Performance on the MMMU benchmark is reported on the validation set as the public test set does not include answers.

#### 4. MedGemma Results

Medical text question-answering: Across all text-only biomedical QA tasks evaluated, MedGemma demonstrated superior performance over the standard Gemma 3 model variant of the same size, as well as competitive performance with much larger models in many cases. This was based on evaluation on MedQA, MedMCQA, PubMedQA, MMLU subsets and AfriMed, shown in Table 3, and the out-of-distribution MedXpertQA, shown in Table 4.

Medical image classification: To further evaluate MedGemma across the modalities that are most highly represented in the training data, we utilized a set of image-based classification tasks across radiology, histopathology, dermatology, and ophthalmology. Although addressing classification as a zero-shot generative task may not provide maximum performance compared to training an embeddingbased classifier, these evaluations provide additional insights into the quality and performance of underlying image encoder and the overall model capabilities. Results are summarized in Table 7 for CXR evaluations and Table 8 for histopathology, dermatology, and retina image classification. MedGemma demonstrated substantially superior performance on these tasks relative to the Gemma 3 baselines, and notably, MedGemma also demonstrated superior performance as compared to much larger API-based models.

MedGemma is also capable of engaging in open-ended clinical reasoning tasks. Examples of such tasks with MedGemma 27B, including clinical commentary on model performance, are shown in

Again, MedGemma 4B demonstrated superior performance over the standard Gemma 3 model variant of the same size, as well as competitive performance with much larger models in many cases. Of note, we did not compare to models for which these metrics are calculated using a discriminative, embedding-based approach. Such approaches can be informative, but use the train set to define the set of possible text answers, and thus represent a classification

###### Prompt

A 62-year old man presents with a 2 cm spiculated right upper lobe peripheral lung nodule and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Imaging furthermore shows multiple metastatic lesions in the liver and bones, and a solitary 1 cm lesion in the right parietal lobe without surrounding vasoedema. A biopsy from the liver demonstrated adenocarcinoma consistent with a lung primary. Genomic sequencing demonstrated TP53 and EGFR L858R mutation, and PD-L1 was 70%. On examination, the patient is without any neurologic deficits and is ECOG 0. What is the best next step in management for this patient?

MedGemma 27B output Okay, let’s break down the management for this patient with Stage IV NSCLC. Key Findings:

- 1. Diagnosis: Stage IV Adenocarcinoma of the Lung (confirmed by liver biopsy).
- 2. Driver Mutation: EGFR L858R mutation (highly actionable).
- 3. Biomarker: PD-L1 70% (high expression).
- 4. Metastases: Widespread (mediastinal nodes, liver, bone, solitary brain lesion).
- 5. Clinical Status: Excellent performance status (ECOG 0), asymptomatic brain lesion. Analysis & Rationale:

- • EGFR Mutation is Paramount: The presence of the EGFR L858R mutation is the most critical factor guiding first-line therapy. Patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC have demonstrated significantly improved outcomes with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) compared to chemotherapy.
- • PD-L1 High: While PD-L1 is high (70%), indicating potential benefit from immunotherapy, current guidelines and clinical trial data (like FLAURA) strongly favor EGFR TKIs as the first-line treatment for patients with EGFR mutations, even those with high PD-L1. Immunotherapy is typically considered after TKI failure or in combination with chemotherapy in specific settings, but not usually as the initial monotherapy in this scenario.
- • Brain Metastasis: The solitary, asymptomatic brain lesion needs management. EGFR TKIs, particularly third-generation agents like Osimertinib, have good central nervous system (CNS) penetration and activity. Therefore, systemic therapy with an EGFR TKI is often the initial approach to treat the brain metastasis as well. Close monitoring with MRI is essential. If the lesion progresses despite systemic therapy or becomes symptomatic, Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS) would be considered.
- • ECOG 0: The patient’s excellent performance status makes him a suitable candidate for aggressive systemic therapy. Best Next Step in Management: The best next step is to initiate first-line systemic therapy with an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI).
- • Preferred Agent: Osimertinib is generally the preferred first-line EGFR TKI due to its superior efficacy (progression-free survival and overall survival) and improved CNS penetration compared to earlier-generation TKIs (like Gefitinib, Erlotinib, Afatinib) demonstrated in the FLAURA trial.
- • Management of Brain Metastasis: Start Osimertinib. Monitor the brain lesion closely with serial MRI scans (e.g., every 3-6 months initially). Consider SRS if the lesion progresses or causes symptoms.
- • Supportive Care: Address potential side effects of the TKI (e.g., rash, diarrhea). Manage potential bone pain with analgesics or palliative radiation if needed.

Commentary by US board-certified practicing oncologist Strengths: Identifies the key components of staging and the actionable driver mutation. PD-L1 is high but correctly identifies TKI as preferable over immunotherapy. Correctly identifies osimertinib as having good brain penetration especially with asymptomatic and small brain lesions. Appropriately highlights FLAURA trial. Includes supportive care aspects including potential side effects. Areas for Improvement: Immunotherapy can be considered after TKI progression, though the treatment paradigm has evolved (i.e., amivantamab + chemotherapy, datopotamab deruxtecan). Although osimertinib is a correct answer, newer combinations are available and have shown benefit over osimertinib alone (i.e., amivantamab + lazertinib, osimertinib + chemotherapy). Serial brain MRI is mentioned but serial rest-of-body imaging is not. Dosing of osimertinib not mentioned. Bone disease discussed, though no consideration for bone modifying agents or for whether surgery may be indicated. Shared decision-making would be a beneficial addition.

task instead of a more flexible open-ended VQA task. Additionally, LLaVA-Med and BiomedGPT-B are included in the results table using previously reported metrics (Li et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023) and demonstrated very strong performance, with the qualifier that such performance involves supervised fine-tuning for the specific datasets. Additionally, LLaVA-Tri (Xie et al., 2024) has reported even higher performance metrics, but the reported methodological details for these metrics are insufficient to inform direct comparison. In addition to these statistical results, we show several anecdotal examples of open-ended visual question-answering in Figures 2 and 3.

Chest X-ray report generation: Results of performance on CXR report generation based on the MIMIC-CXR dataset and the RadGraph F1 metric are shown in Table 10. The results demonstrate that our pretrained MedGemma models can achieve SOTA-level results by training with MIMIC-CXR dataset as our only CXR-related dataset. This shows the versatility of Gemma’s architecture in adapting to complex medical use cases. In addition, expert human evaluation shown in Figure 4 found that 68% and 49% of generated reports in normal and abnormal studies respectively were equal or superior to the original reports, with 81% of generated reports overall resulting in the same or superior clinical decisions in comparison to the original reports. For comparison, in a similar study, 73% of reports generated by the larger Med-Gemini model would have resulted in the same or superior clinical decisions in comparison to the original reports (Yang et al., 2024).

Medical agentic behavior: To provide initial insights into the capabilities of MedGemma in the setting of more realistic use cases beyond single turn question answering, we also evaluated MedGemma in an agentic role using the AgentClinic benchmark (Schmidgall et al., 2024). In this task, the model functions as a “physician agent” in simulated clinical encounters, requiring tasks like patient history taking, exam interpretation, and diagnosis under uncertainty to reach correct answers. Using the text-only AgentClinic-MedQA and AgentClinic-MIMIC-IV environments (with GPT-4o for the patient agent and measurement), MedGemma 27B showed superior performance to Gemma 3 27B, exceeding performance of human physicians on AgentClinic-MedQA, and approaching performance of much larger models on both datasets. Results are summarized in Table 11. Of note, the 4B variants (MedGemma and Gemma 3) were not well suited for this task, demonstrating difficulty following system instructions for the agentic framework as provided by AgentClinic.

General purpose benchmarks: Given the limitations and poor performance that many medicallyspecialized models exhibit when faced with non-medical tasks, we also evaluated for possible tradeoffs

of specialization. Models were evaluated on MMLU Pro, Global MMLU Lite, and MMMU benchmark datasets, with performance comparisons between MedGemma and Gemma 3 variants shown in (Table 12). MedGemma demonstrated only minor decreases in performance relative to the general models of the same size, further suggesting potential utility for downstream applications that require both specialized as well as generalized capabilities such as instruction following or diverse user interactions.

Observed themes: Several key themes emerged from our analysis. While larger, more computationally expensive models generally performed better, medically-specialized models like MedGemma exhibited a distinct advantage relative to their parameter size. This size-to-performance benefit was especially pronounced in medical vision-based tasks, where smaller clinical models, in some instances, even surpassed the performance of significantly larger general-purpose models. Notably, there was a 500fold difference in computational cost between MedGemma 4B and the most expensive comparator model, a crucial consideration for practical application development where both development and compute usage are constraints.

We also observed that performance on older, established benchmarks tended to improve with newer models. While this observation reflects genuine advancements in model capabilities, it also raises the possibility of test data leakage, as these benchmarks are publicly available and frequently used in model development and evaluation.

§ Prior reported results

classes difficult to describe using language alone, new domains that the base models haven’t been trained on) will need to further adapt the models.

We conducted four fine-tuning experiments to demonstrate MedGemma’s capacity to be adapted. There are three multimodal tasks, (1) MIMIC-CXR clinical report generation, (2) SIIM-ARC CXR pneumothorax classification (Zawacki et al., 2019), and (3) CRC100k histopathology patch classification (Kather et al., 2018), as well as one text-only task involving long-context electronic health record (EHR) question answering. In these experiments, we adapted the released models via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for the multimodal tasks and RL for the EHR task. We note that the only task that strictly required the usage of SFT instead of RL is MIMIC-CXR report generation, in order to capture the implicit reporting style; other tasks can be fine-tuned through either SFT or RL. In our experience, the performance trade-off between these two methods needs to be established on a case-by-case basis given the dataset size, distribution shift compared to the original training datasets, and difficulty of the task.

###### 5.1. Fine-tuning for multimodal tasks

We utilized the instruction-tuned version of MedGemma 4B as the base model for the multimodal fine-tuning tasks. For MIMIC-CXR report generation tasks, the image and the indication section of the report were used as the input, and the model was trained to complete the finding and impression sections of the report. For pneumothorax classification and histopathology patch classification, the classification task was formulated as a multiple choice question, the image and a multiple choice question prompt were used as the input, and the model was trained to produce the correct choice. The model was fine-tuned through SFT which involves full parameter updates by optimizing a standard cross-entropy loss function for next token prediction. The input image and prompt were excluded from the loss computation. For SIIM-ARC and CRC100k, since these data sets provide no validation split, we reserved a random 10% per label of the original training data to form a validation set. For each task, we conducted a hyperparameter sweep across three learning rates (1e–7, 5e–7, 1e–6) and

fine-tuned the model for a single epoch. The checkpoints that achieved the highest performance on the validation set were selected for the final evaluation on the test set.

The results in Table 13 show the effectiveness of further adapting the MedGemma models to specific use cases. The adapted models more closely approached SOTA models on these tasks (Chen et al., 2020a; Dai et al., 2024; Zhou et al., 2024). Notably, the fine-tuned MedGemma 4B established a new SOTA performance with a RadGraph F1 score of 30.3 on the MIMIC-CXR report generation task.

###### 5.2. Fine-tuning for EHR information retrieval and reasoning

While numerous benchmarks assess the ability of language models to reason over EHRs, including emrQA (Pampari et al., 2018), emrKBQA (Raghavan et al., 2021), EHRSQL (Lee et al., 2024), EHRNoteQA (Kweon et al., 2024), and MedAlign (Fleming et al., 2024), we developed a new benchmark for MedGemma specifically focused on longitudinal, outpatient EHR data. Our benchmark, which we call EHRQA, is based on a programmatic framework to generate question-answer (QA) pairs from synthetic, FHIR-formatted records. These records were produced using Synthea (Walonoski et al., 2018), a tool that simulates complete patient medical histories based on population statistics and disease progression models. From an initial 100 synthetic records, we selected 81 that fit within a 32k context window, splitting them into training (42), validation (20), and test (19) sets. Each patient record is comprehensive, containing hundreds to thousands of FHIR entries across various resource types like Conditions, Medications, and Observations. A key limitation of this dataset, however, is the absence of clinical notes, which we hope to address in future work.

Our QA generation framework treated each patient’s FHIR record as a collection of ground truth facts. It expanded upon these facts through a multi-hop reasoning process (Yang et al., 2018) that integrated information from external medical knowledge bases (SNOMED, RxNorm, LOINC), applied programmatic reasoning (e.g., temporal, arithmetic), and leveraged inter-dependencies within the patient’s data programmatically. These derived facts are then converted into natural language QA pairs using templated questions and large language model (LLM) rephrasing. In collaboration with clinicians, we developed 42 distinct question types, grouped into 10 categories, to reflect queries from both healthcare professionals and consumers (see Appendix Table A8 for more details). This process generated approximately 200 questions per patient. In total, there are 10,437 QA examples in the training split, 5,133 QA examples in the validation split, and 4,377 QA examples in the test split. All questions were designed for automated evaluation (e.g., regex matching) and support multiple-choice, Yes/No, and simple free-response formats. For evaluation, the model is prompted with a condensed, plain-text representation of the patient’s FHIR data and the corresponding question. Final accuracies are calculated by averaging the scores across the 10 question categories. The prompts used for rephrasing and evaluation are available in Appendix Table A9.

Our initial results revealed a performance gap between MedGemma 27B and larger models. To address this, we fine-tuned MedGemma 27B using RL on the EHRQA training set. Applying RL to the MedGemma 27B resulted in a substantial improvement in its EHRQA accuracy, closing the gap with top-performing models, as shown in Table 14. Notably, the greatest gains were observed in question categories requiring reasoning across inter-dependent records (Appendix Figure A3). This experiment underscores the potential of fine-tuning smaller, specialized models like MedGemma for effective use in EHR applications.

#### 6. MedSigLIP Evaluations

MedSigLIP was evaluated both on zero-shot classification performance and linear probe classification performance (also referred to as data-efficient classification). Zero-shot classification performance was assessed as a measure of baseline performance, and linear probe performance was assessed to gauge performance on target conditions after additional training with logistic regression.

Evaluation datasets spanned four modalities: chest X-ray, dermatology, ophthalmology and histopathology. For chest X-ray, we followed the evaluation datasets and framework in ELIXR (Xu et al., 2023). For linear probing, we utilized the same data from CheXpert and CXR14 and evaluated on seven findings (atelectasis, cardiomegaly, airspace opacity, fracture, pneumothorax, consolidation, pleural effusion, and pulmonary edema). For zero-shot, we compared with ELIXR on the 13 positive findings from CheXpert test set. For dermatology, we evaluated on US-Derm MCQA. The US-Derm MCQA test set has 79 dermatological conditions that overlap with the classification labels from the training dataset, thus we pick this 79-condition subset (1612 patients) for our vision based classification and zero-shot evaluation. For ophthalmology, we used the EyePACS test dataset. For histopathology, patches were extracted from whole slide images across a variety of tissue types and tasks as in Yang et al. (2024) and these patches were treated as individual images. See Appendix Table A2 for a description of the detailed classes for the evaluations.

Zero-shot evaluation approach and metrics: For each class within each condition, one or more text prompts were used to represent the class. When there were multiple prompts for the same class, the text embeddings for each prompt were averaged together to obtain a single embedding per class. Cosine similarity was then calculated between the image embedding and text embeddings for the class options, softmax was applied to output scores, and the AUC (area under receiver operating characteristic curve) was calculated. In the case of multiclass conditions, 1-vs-all AUC was calculated. For dermatology, zero-shot prompts are directly their condition names. Prompts for ophthalmology, chest X-ray, histopathology are provided in Appendix Tables A3, A4, and A5.

Linear probe evaluation approach and metrics: Linear probe (data efficient) classification was assessed by extracting image embeddings from MedSigLIP (without use of the text encoder) and training a logistic regression using the SAGA solver (Defazio et al., 2014) on the train set embeddings, with the hyper-parameters chosen on the validation set, then evaluating on the test set.

#### 7. MedSigLIP Results

Zero-shot and linear probe classification results and evaluation tasks for MedSigLIP and corresponding Health AI Developer Foundations (HAI-DEF) (Kiraly et al., 2024) models are summarized below. For the HAI-DEF Derm Foundation and Path Foundation models, zero-shot classification was not possible with the comparator models because of their image-only nature.

Figure 5 | Average results for data efficient learning on 7 Chest X-ray findings on CheXpert and CXR14 datasets compared to HAI-DEF’s CXR Foundation model based on ELIXR (Xu et al., 2023). Individual results per condition per dataset can be found in Appendix Figures A1 and A2.

On CXR, MedSigLIP is compared to the HAI-DEF CXR Foundation model, which is based on ELIXR (Xu et al., 2023), with zero-shot results shown in Table 16 and linear probe classification results shown in Figure 5. On average, MedSigLIP’s zero-shot CXR performance was 2.0% higher than CXR Foundation despite MedSigLIP’s lower image resolution (448×448 vs 1280×1280) and multi-domain expertise, suggesting that MedSigLIP can serve as a strong foundation model. Notably, classification of fractures, which has historically proven difficult, improved over ELIXR by 7.1%. Across the 7 findings used for linear probing, MedSigLIP also demonstrated strong performance when training set sample size is larger or equal to 512 examples, Figure 5.

Dermatology, ophthalmology and histopathology results are summarized in Table 15. For dermatology, both MedSigLIP zero-shot and linear probes outperformed linear probes with Derm Foundation on the task of distinguishing between 79 skin conditions. For ophthalmology, on the 5-class task of classifying diabetic retinopathy (none, mild, moderate, severe, and proliferative), linear probe performance exceeded zero-shot performance by 9.8%, though no HAI-DEF model currently exists for comparison. For histopathology, linear probing achieved a modest improvement over zero-shot classification using MedSigLIP, and performing close to Path Foundation which has linear probe performance that is 1.9% better on average.

MedSigLIP offers strong baseline performance across a variety of medical domains as a single model and generally does well with zero-shot classification even when compared to linear probes with dedicated, domain-specific models. Further training with task-specific images and logistic regression can yield stronger results.

#### 8. Discussion

We introduced MedGemma, a new collection of medical vision-language foundation models and MedSigLIP, a multi-domain medical image encoder. These models were built upon Gemma 3, with optimization for medical domains. We evaluated across a range of medical benchmarks across clinical reasoning, biomedical knowledge, report generation, and medical image classification, finding strong performance for MedGemma and MedSigLIP. Performance improved further after fine-tuning, highlighting the potential for these open models to be used as a starting point for developing useful AI applications for healthcare.

With an increasing number of options available to developers building AI applications in healthcare, MedGemma provides specific advantages over general models. These advantages are largely due to optimized incorporation of domain specific data for both pre-training and post-training and are illustrated by the improvements over base Gemma 3 models across all benchmarks evaluated and the achievement of performance on par with much larger models.

When compared to general API-based models like Gemini, MedGemma is likely the preferred model if the use case requires any of the following: a frozen model for documentation and reliability, sensitivity to training or inference costs, ability to run locally or offline, specific medical image and text capabilities, or full control over model adaptation. Large models like Gemini remain a viable choice where the user requires optimal broad performance without the above constraints, and large models may additionally be used in concert with models like MedGemma in agentic settings.

The MedGemma collection of models enables a wide range of potential downstream applications for the developer community. The multimodal capabilities, including access to image and text embeddings, may be particularly useful for medical image retrieval. This could aid in interpretation by referencing similar past cases as well as enabling development of research cohorts and creating educational tools. MedGemma allows for the integration of diverse data, linking radiology, histopathology, ophthalmology, and dermatology images with clinical information. The specialized text capabilities of the models can also extract key concepts from imaging reports and clinical notes, streamlining tasks such as matching patients for clinical trials, conducting pharmacovigilance reviews, or analyzing healthcare quality metrics. The models’ ability to understand medical images and generate reports can also be fine-tuned to better assist radiologists and other clinicians in their workflow and improve how findings are communicated to patients. In addition to standalone use, these models can also serve as powerful tools within agentic frameworks, combining abilities across different modalities for customized and comprehensive solutions.

In this report, we evaluated the performance of MedGemma and MedSigLIP on a broad set of established benchmarks in order to provide a snapshot of the model capabilities. However, we note that limitations exist for these benchmarks. For one, automated benchmarks represent only the first step towards validating real-world utility (Alaa et al., 2025; Mahmood, 2025). Additionally, some benchmarks may be near saturation in terms of model performance, with minimal headroom for improvements, thus hindering the measurement of progress. As such, further work is warranted to continue evaluation of these models on new, high quality (and more challenging) benchmarks aimed at better reflecting real-world utility (e.g. Bedi et al., 2025). More work is also needed to understand the performance capabilities and requirements in regard to actual application development, including their incorporation into agentic frameworks. These efforts will inform optimal use cases as well as development of future model versions with extended capabilities.

We openly released MedGemma and MedSigLIP to facilitate their widespread evaluation, improvement, and adaptation by the community. Openness is critical in many healthcare applications,

- as it provides developers with predictability and the flexibility for extensive model adaptation and evaluation. We hope that our approach accelerates the development of AI applications across a broad array of healthcare use cases.

#### 9. Conclusion

In this work, we showed that MedGemma models demonstrate robust capabilities across a variety of vision-language and text-only medical tasks. We also showed that MedSigLIP demonstrates robust multi-domain capabilities, and can thus serve as a strong medical foundation model. The breadth and efficiency of these models offers exciting possibilities to address a range of use cases. At the same time, thoughtful validation of safety, performance, and reliability for any downstream applications remains a critical aspect to advance the use of multimodal AI models in medicine. By providing these MedGemma and MedSigLIP models to the developer community with a permissive license, we hope to see them enable useful and innovative medical applications.

#### A. Manual Evaluation of Radiology reports

Table A1 provides the detailed rubric definitions provided to the radiologist for scoring the generated CXR reports.

- Table A1 | Human evaluation rubric comparing AI generated radiology reports to original reports. Rubric Score Rubric Definition

AI report captures key clinically relevant findings that are not found in original report. AI report would result in correct patient management and original report would not.

AI » Original Report

AI report captures more relevant findings, but both would result in the same correct patient management.

AI > Original Report

Both reports capture similar findings in the image and would result in correct patient management.

AI ∼ Original Report

Original report captures more relevant findings, but both would result in the same correct patient management.

AI < Original Report

Original report captures key clinically relevant findings that are not found in AI report. original report would result in correct patient management and AI report would not.

AI « Original Report

X Neither report would result in correct patient management.

#### B. Evaluation Prompts

For evaluating MedSigLIP zero-shot tasks, Tabes A2 to A5 list the prompts used.

For evaluating MedGemma, the default temperature of 0.0 was used. All other models made use of their default system temperature. Two different system prompts were used in providing results for other LLMs directly evaluated:

- • You are a helpful radiology assistant. For radiology-based tasks.
- • You are a helpful medical assistant. For all other medical tasks.

###### Prompt

A 55-year old woman with active smoking history, type II diabetes, hypertension, history of coronary artery disease was recently hospitalized for heart failure with an ejection fraction of 35%. She is presenting for follow-up post discharge. Her discharge medications included lisinopril 10 mg daily, carvedilol 2.5 mg twice daily, and eplerenone 25 mg daily, in addition to her usual medications for diabetes. In clinic, she reports feeling symptomatic with dyspnea after going up 1 flight of stairs though is asymptomatic at rest. Vital signs at rest: BP 130/90, HR 75, RR 10, Temperature 97.2F, SpO2 98% on room air. Labs are remarkable for Na 132 mEq/L, K 4.9 mEq/L, BUN 22 mg/dL, Cr 1.04 mg/dL. The patient reports having a friend on Entresto. Please review whether Entresto is indicated in this patient and why or why not.

Continued on next page

Okay, let’s review the indication for Entresto (sacubitril/valsartan) in this patient. Patient Summary:

- • Diagnosis: Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction (HFrEF), EF 35%.
- • Symptoms: Dyspnea on exertion (1 flight of stairs), NYHA Class II-III.
- • Current HFrEF Medications: Lisinopril (ACE inhibitor), Carvedilol (Beta-blocker), Eplerenone (MRA).
- • Comorbidities: Smoking, Type II Diabetes, Hypertension, CAD.
- • Relevant Labs: K 4.9 mEq/L (high-normal), Cr 1.04 mg/dL (mildly elevated/high-normal).
- • Vitals: BP 130/90 mmHg (acceptable for initiation). Entresto Indication Review: Entresto (sacubitril/valsartan) is indicated for the reduction of cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure in adult patients with chronic heart failure (NYHA class II-IV) with reduced ejection fraction (LVEF ≤ 40%). Analysis for this Patient:

- 1. Ejection Fraction: The patient’s EF is 35%, which meets the criteria (≤ 40%).
- 2. Symptom Status: The patient is symptomatic (dyspnea on exertion) despite being on foundational guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) including an ACE inhibitor (lisinopril), a beta-blocker (carvedilol), and an MRA (eplerenone). This is the target population for Entresto.
- 3. Contraindications:

- • ACE Inhibitor Use: Entresto should not be used concurrently with an ACE inhibitor (like lisinopril) due to increased risk of angioedema, hypotension, and hyperkalemia. The lisinopril would need to be stopped, typically with a 36-hour washout period, before starting Entresto.
- • Angioedema History: No history of angioedema related to ACE inhibitors or ARBs is mentioned.
- • Hypotension: Her current BP of 130/90 mmHg is generally acceptable for initiating Entresto, although close monitoring is needed.
- • Renal Function: Her creatinine is 1.04 mg/dL. While Entresto can cause a small increase in creatinine, this level is not a contraindication, but renal function should be monitored.
- • Potassium: Her potassium is 4.9 mEq/L (high-normal). This requires close monitoring, as Entresto can increase potassium levels, especially in combination with an MRA like eplerenone.

Conclusion: Yes, Entresto is indicated for this patient. Reasoning: She has symptomatic HFrEF (EF 35%) despite being on appropriate foundational therapy (ACE inhibitor, beta-blocker, MRA). Clinical trials have demonstrated that switching from an ACE inhibitor (like lisinopril) to Entresto significantly reduces morbidity and mortality in this patient population. Important Considerations:

- • Lisinopril Discontinuation: The lisinopril must be stopped before starting Entresto.
- • Monitoring: Close monitoring of blood pressure, heart rate, renal function (creatinine/eGFR), and potassium levels is crucial, especially after initiation and dose titration.
- • Dosing: Entresto is typically started at a low dose (e.g., 24/25 mg BID) and titrated upwards to the target dose (e.g., 49/51 mg BID or 97/103 mg BID) as tolerated, based on guideline recommendations.

This represents a significant therapeutic opportunity to improve her heart failure outcomes. Commentary by a US board-certified practicing cardiologist Strengths: Correctly states that entresto is indicated for the reduction of CV death and HF hospitalization. Appropriately checks renal function, electrolytes, angioedema and BP. Lists washout and monitoring. Areas for Improvement: Dose is incorrect for the lowest dose of entresto. Minor nit that entresto has now been shown in meta-analysis to reduce all cause mortality in EF<40% (not just cardiac mortality as stated) (Evbayekha et al., 2025). Creatinine is mentioned but estimated GFR is the more useful measure. Minor but no mention of carvedilol dose. The dose is very low and should be increased. If it is increased, there will be less BP room for entresto so would need to titrate both carefully but can be done rapidly (Strong HF trial). The other thing that could have been mentioned is empaglaflozin which is not included in this list. But the question is specific to entresto so understandable.

- Table A11 | Example of MedGemma 27B open clinical reasoning in a cardiology setting with succinct output, including commentary by a US board-certified practicing cardiologist Prompt Same as in Table A10 with the suffix: Please be succinct. MedGemma 27B output

Yes, Entresto is indicated. Rationale: This patient has symptomatic Heart Failure with reduced Ejection Fraction (HFrEF) (EF 35%,

NYHA Class II) despite being on foundational guideline-directed medical therapy (ACE inhibitor, beta-blocker, MRA). Entresto (sacubitril/valsartan) is recommended to replace the ACE inhibitor (lisinopril) in such patients to further reduce cardiovascular death and heart failure hospitalizations. Her current BP and potassium levels are acceptable for initiation, although close monitoring is required.

Clinical commentary by a US board-certified practicing cardiologist Strengths: A more useful answer - short and to the point, including the rationale for the treatment. Areas for Improvement: Does not include renal function in the list of things to monitor (just BP and potassium). Same note as above that entresto has now been shown in meta-analysis to reduce all cause mortality in EF<40% rather than just cardiac mortality as stated.

###### Prompt

A 17-year old otherwise healthy man presents in the emergency room for fatigue and spiking fevers. Two weeks prior, he reports having felt flu-like symptoms with fever, nausea, vomiting, and cough. Symptoms persisted but have worsened, with new onset shortness of breath, headache, and abdominal discomfort. There have been no sick contacts at home. He has been backpacking across various regions in the United States, most recently in Hawaii. On evaluation, vital signs are remarkable for SBP 115/85, HR 110, RR 14, Temperature 102.2F, SpO2 90% on room air. Exam is remarkable for bilateral crackles and icterus. Labs show the following:

- • WBC: 18.2 × 103/mcL, Hb: 15.5 g/dL, Plt: 120 × 103/mcL
- • Na: 142 mEq/L, K: 5.1 mEq/L, Cl: 101 mEq/L, CO2: 26 mEq/L, BUN: 46 mg/dL, Cr: 2.2 mg/dL
- • ALP: 84 U/L, ALT: 175 U/L, AST: 140 U/L, Total bilirubin: 2.0 mg/dL CXR shows bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. A follow-up echocardiogram shows EF 40%. A respiratory viral panel was negative. Blood, sputum, and urine cultures are taken. What would be the next best steps in terms of diagnostic testing to establish the etiology of his symptoms?

Continued on next page

###### Rationale Breakdown:

- 1. Clinical Presentation Analysis: The patient presents with a severe, multi-system illness characterized by fever, fatigue, shortness of breath, headache, abdominal discomfort, jaundice (icterus), hypoxia, leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, acute kidney injury (elevated BUN/Cr), hepatitis (elevated ALT/AST/bilirubin), and possible myocarditis (reduced EF on echo). The illness began with flu-like symptoms two weeks ago and has progressively worsened.
- 2. Key Clues:

- • Travel History: Recent travel to Hawaii is a significant clue, pointing towards infections endemic to that region.
- • Multi-organ Involvement: The combination of pulmonary infiltrates, jaundice, AKI, and myocarditis suggests a systemic process, often infectious.
- • Specific Lab Findings: Leukocytosis with thrombocytopenia, elevated liver enzymes, and bilirubin are important diagnostic pointers.

- 3. Differential Diagnosis (Focusing on Hawaii-Endemic Infections):

- • Leptospirosis: Highly consistent with the presentation. Causes fever, headache, myalgia, conjunctival suffusion (not mentioned but common), jaundice, renal failure, pulmonary hemorrhage/ARDS, and myocarditis. Thrombocytopenia is common; leukocytosis can occur. Hawaii is an endemic area.
- • Dengue Fever: Endemic in Hawaii. Causes fever, headache, myalgia, rash (not mentioned), leukopenia (patient has leukocytosis), thrombocytopenia. Severe dengue can cause organ impairment, but the specific combination of jaundice, AKI, and myocarditis with leukocytosis makes it less likely than leptospirosis.
- • Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS): Endemic in Hawaii. Causes fever, myalgia, headache, followed by respiratory failure and pulmonary edema. Thrombocytopenia and leukocytosis are typical. However, significant jaundice and myocarditis are less characteristic of HPS.
- • Rickettsial Infections (e.g., Murine Typhus, Scrub Typhus): Endemic in Hawaii. Can cause fever, headache, rash, myalgia, sometimes pneumonia, hepatitis, AKI.
- • Other possibilities: Influenza (severe complications), other viral hepatitis (EBV, CMV), bacterial sepsis, melioidosis (rare but reported).

- 4. Prioritizing Diagnostic Tests: Based on the clinical picture and travel history, Leptospirosis is the most likely diagnosis. Therefore, specific testing for Leptospirosis should be prioritized. Dengue and Hantavirus are also important considerations due to endemicity and overlapping features.
- 5. Specific Diagnostic Tests:

- • Leptospirosis:

- – Serology: ELISA for IgM antibodies is often the first step for faster results. Microscopic Agglutination Test (MAT) is the gold standard but takes longer. Paired sera (acute and convalescent) are often needed for definitive diagnosis.
- – PCR: Detects Leptospira DNA in blood (early) or urine (can be positive later, especially after the first week). Given the patient is 2 weeks into symptoms, urine PCR might be useful.

- • Dengue:

- – Serology: IgM/IgG antibodies.
- – NS1 Antigen: Detectable early in illness.
- – PCR: Detects viral RNA early in illness.

- • Hantavirus:

- – Serology: IgM/IgG antibodies.
- – PCR: Detects viral RNA early in illness.

- • Other Tests: While awaiting results for the primary suspects, continue monitoring organ function (liver, kidney), coagulation, and review pending cultures. Consider additional tests like EBV/CMV serology, HIV testing, and Rickettsial serology/PCR if the initial workup is negative or the clinical picture evolves.

- 6. Conclusion: The most crucial next steps are to order specific diagnostic tests for the most likely endemic infections given the patient’s presentation and travel history, particularly Leptospirosis, Dengue, and Hantavirus.

Final Answer: The final answer is

|Order specific serological and PCR testing for Leptospirosis, Dengue, and Hantavirus|

Commentary by a UK Specialist Registrar in infectious diseases Strengths: Well-structured answer, making the information easy to parse. Correctly has the most likely diagnosis (lepto) as the focus of the answer. The suggested diagnostic testing enables confirmation of the specific diagnoses listed in the differential. Areas for Improvement: Dengue fever, hantavirus and melioidosis don’t seem to occur in Hawaii much, if at all (and at least, they are not endemic, as stated in the answer). The suggested diagnostic testing perhaps narrows towards specific diagnoses too quickly, whereas in reality broader testing may still be necessary (e.g. CSF analysis given headache, further chest imaging via CT, etc.) alongside more specific confirmatory tests. It could mention that many of these diagnostic tests are relatively unusual in most hospitals, often requiring samples to be sent via courier to specialized labs, and therefore there is a significant time lag associated with getting results. This may necessitate empiric treatment whilst awaiting for results, which is an important clinical consideration.

Prompt Same as in Table A12 with the suffix: Please be succinct. MedGemma 27B output Next best steps in diagnostic testing:

- 1. Leptospirosis serology (IgM ELISA/MAT).
- 2. Hantavirus serology (IgM).
- 3. Dengue serology (IgM/IgG, NS1 antigen).
- 4. Blood and urine cultures.
- 5. Urinalysis.
- 6. Cardiac enzymes (Troponin).
- 7. Coagulation studies. Commentary by a UK Specialist Registrar in infectious diseases

Strengths: Correctly lists confirmatory diagnostic tests for each suggested differential. Covers both specific confirmatory tests (to pinpoint a particular condition) and more generalized diagnostics (e.g. coagulation studies) that would yield more useful information to guide next steps in case the confirmatory diagnostic tests are negative. Areas for Improvement: Same feedback as before regarding the epidemiology of hantavirus/dengue in Hawaii - seems to be rare, if at all present. Repeats several items already listed as being performed in the query (e.g. blood, urine cultures). Unclear why it limits the infectious disease testing to a single antibody (IgM) for each potential cause - it would be normal to perform IgM and IgG as both are useful in distinguishing between an acute infection versus a prior infection. No mention of molecular (genetic) testing which is increasingly used for diagnosis.

#### F. MedGemma 27B multimodal model

In addition to the MedGemma 4B multimodal and 27B text-only variants described earlier in this report, we are also releasing a MedGemma 27B multimodal variant. The training methodology for this variant was the same as for the MedGemma 4B multimodal model with the addition of two training datasets: EHRQA (details in Section 5.2), to improve the model’s inherent EHR understanding, and Chest ImaGenome (Goldberger et al., 2000; Wu et al., 2021), to enable anatomy localization on chest X-ray images.

The MedGemma 27B multimodal variant provides all of the capabilities of the 4B multimodal variant but with significantly improved language capabilities as well as improved EHR understanding and anatomy localization. Formal evaluation of this variant is ongoing but preliminary results can be found in Table A14.
