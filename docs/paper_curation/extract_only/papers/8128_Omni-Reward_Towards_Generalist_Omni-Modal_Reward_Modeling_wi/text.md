ABSTRACT

Reward models (RMs) play a critical role in aligning AI behaviors with human preferences, yet they face two fundamental challenges: (1) Modality Imbalance, where most RMs are mainly focused on text and image modalities, offering limited support for video, audio, and other modalities; and (2) Preference Rigidity, where training on fixed binary preference pairs fails to capture the complexity and diversity of personalized preferences. To address the above challenges, we propose Omni-Reward, a step toward generalist omni-modal reward modeling with support for free-form preferences, consisting of: (1) Evaluation: We introduce Omni-RewardBench, the first omni-modal RM benchmark with freeform preferences, covering nine tasks across five modalities including text, image, video, audio, and 3D; (2) Data: We construct Omni-RewardData, a multimodal preference dataset comprising 248K general preference pairs and 69K instruction-tuning pairs for training generalist omni-modal RMs; (3) Model: We propose Omni-RewardModel, which includes both discriminative and generative RMs, and achieves strong performance on Omni-RewardBench as well as other widely used reward modeling benchmarks.

1 INTRODUCTION

To achieve more human-like intelligence (Shams & Seitz, 2008), artificial general intelligence (AGI) is increasingly advancing toward an omni-modal paradigm (Wu et al., 2024; Fang et al., 2024; Xie et al., 2024), where AI models are expected to process and generate information across diverse modalities (i.e., any-to-any models). Benefiting from the rapid progress in large language models (LLMs) (Dubey et al., 2024; Yang et al., 2024), researchers are extending their powerful text-centric capabilities to other modalities such as images, video, and audio, enabling models (e.g., GPT-4o (OpenAI, 2024), Gemini 2.0 Flash (DeepMind, 2025), and Qwen2.5-Omni (Xu et al., 2025)) to not only understand multimodal inputs but also generate outputs using the most appropriate modality.

Despite the remarkable progress that existing omni-modal models have achieved on textual, visual, and auditory tasks, aligning their behaviors with human preferences remains a fundamental challenge (Ji et al., 2024; Yu et al., 2024b; Zhang et al., 2025). For example, models may fail to follow user instructions in speech-based interactions (i.e., helpfulness), respond to sensitive prompts with harmful videos (i.e., harmlessness), or generate hallucinated content when describing images (i.e., trustworthy). Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) (Ziegler et al., 2019; Ouyang et al., 2022) has emerged as a promising approach for aligning model behaviors with human preferences. RLHF

integrates human feedback into the training loop by using it to guide the model toward more desirable and human-aligned responses. This process (Dong et al., 2024) involves collecting human preference data to train a reward model (RM), which is subsequently used to fine-tune the original model through reinforcement learning by providing reward signals that guide its behavior. Therefore, RMs play a pivotal role in RLHF, acting as a learned proxy of human preferences.

However, current RMs face two challenging problems: (1) Modality Imbalance: Most existing RMs (Park et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2024a; Zang et al., 2025b) predominantly focus on text and image modalities, while offering limited support for other modalities such as video and audio. With the development of omni-modal models, achieving alignment in both understanding and generation across underrepresented modalities is becoming critically important; (2) Preference Rigidity: Current preference data (Kirstain et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2024a) is typically collected based on broadly accepted high-level values, such as helpfulness and harmlessness. RMs are then trained on these binary preference pairs, resulting in a fixed and implicit notion of preference embedded within the model. Nevertheless, because human preferences cannot be neatly categorized into binary divisions, this paradigm fails to capture the diversity of personalized preferences (Lee et al., 2024).

Considering the above challenges, we propose Omni-Reward, a step towards universal omnimodal reward modeling with free-form preferences. For modality imbalance, Omni-Reward should be able to handle all modalities used in omni-modal models, including those that are rarely covered in existing preference data, such as video and audio. It should also support reward shaping for complex multimodal tasks, such as image editing, video understanding, and audio generation, enabling a broad range of real-world applications. For preference rigidity, Omni-Reward should not only capture general preferences grounded in widely shared human values, but also be capable of dynamically adjusting reward scores based on specific free-form preferences and multi-dimensional evaluation criteria. To achieve this goal, we design Omni-Reward based on three key aspects:

[Figure 2]

Evaluation: RM evaluations (Lambert et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2024c; Zhou et al., 2024) have primarily focused on text-only tasks, with recent efforts extending to visual understanding and generation (Wu et al., 2023a; Li et al., 2024a; Chen et al., 2024b). Moreover, most RM benchmarks emphasize general preference judgments, while largely overlooking user-specific preferences and modality-dependent evaluation needs. To address these gaps, we introduce Omni-RewardBench, an omni-modal reward modeling benchmark with free-form preferences, designed to evaluate the performance of RMs across diverse modalities. Specifically, we collect prompts from various tasks and domains, elicit modality-specific responses from multiple models, and employ three annotators to provide free-form preference descriptions and label each response pair as chosen, rejected, or tied. Ultimately, Omni-RewardBench includes 3,725 high-quality human-annotated preference pairs, encompassing 9 distinct tasks and covering modalities such as text, image, video, audio, and 3D data.

Data: Current RMs are built upon large amounts of high-quality preference data. However, these preference datasets are typically designed for specific tasks and preferences, making it challenging for RMs to adapt to unseen multimodal tasks or user preferences. To enhance generalization, we construct Omni-RewardData, a large-scale multimodal preference dataset that spans a wide range of tasks. We collect existing preference datasets to support general preference learning, and propose in-house instruction-tuning data to help RMs understand user preferences expressed in free-form language. Omni-RewardData comprises 248K general and 69K fine-grained preference pairs.

Model: Building on Omni-RewardData, we further introduce two omni-modal reward models: Omni-RewardModel-BT and Omni-RewardModel-R1. First, we train a discriminative RM named Omni-RewardModel-BT on the full Omni-RewardData using a classic Bradley–Terry objective. Despite strong performance, its scoring process lacks transparency. To address this, we explore a reinforcement learning approach to train a generative RM, named Omni-RewardModel-R1. It encourages the RM to engage in explicit reasoning by generating a textual critic in addition to producing a scalar score, and it is trained with only 3% of the Omni-RewardData.

Built upon Omni-RewardBench, we conduct a thorough evaluation of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) used as generative RMs, including GPT-4o (OpenAI, 2024), Gemini-2.0 (DeepMind, 2025), Qwen2.5-VL (Bai et al., 2025), and Gemma-3 (Team, 2025), as well as several purpose-built RMs for multimodal tasks, such as IXC-2.5-Reward (Zang et al., 2025a) and UnifiedReward (Wang et al., 2025). Our experimental results reveal the following findings: (1) Omni-RewardBench presents significant challenges for current MLLMs, especially under the w/

Ties setting. The strongest commercial model, Claude 3.5 Sonnet (Anthropic, 2024b), achieves the highest accuracy at 66.54%, followed closely by the open-source Gemma-3 27B at 65.12%, while existing purpose-built multimodal RMs still lag behind, indicating substantial room for improvement.

- (2) There indeed exists the modality imbalance problem, particularly evident in the poor performance of existing models on tasks such as text-to-audio, text-to-3D, and text-image-to-image. (3) RM performance is significantly correlated across various multimodal understanding (or generation) tasks, suggesting a certain degree of generalization potential within similar task categories.

Building on the findings above, we further evaluate how well Omni-RewardModel addresses the limitations of existing RMs. Our experiments uncover the key insights below: (1) Omni-RewardModel achieves strong performance on Omni-RewardBench, attaining 73.68% accuracy under the w/o Ties setting and 65.36% accuracy under the w/ Ties setting, and shows strong generalization to challenging tasks. (2) Omni-RewardModel also captures general human preferences and achieves performance comparable to or even better than the state-of-the-art (SOTA) on public RM benchmarks such as VL-RewardBench (Li et al., 2024a) and Multimodal RewardBench (Yasunaga et al., 2025). (3) Instruction-tuning is crucial for RMs, as it effectively alleviates the preference rigidity issue and enables the model to dynamically adjust reward scores according to free-form user preferences. In summary, our contributions are as follows:

- (1) We present Omni-RewardBench, the first omni-modal reward modeling benchmark with free-form preferences, designed to systematically evaluate the performance of RMs across diverse modalities. It includes nine multimodal tasks and 3,725 high-quality preference pairs, posing significant challenges to existing multimodal RMs, revealing substantial room for improvement.
- (2) We construct Omni-RewardData, a multimodal preference dataset comprising 248K general preference pairs and 69K newly collected instruction-tuning pairs with free-form preference descriptions, enabling RMs to generalize across modalities and align with diverse user preferences.
- (3) We propose Omni-RewardModel, including the discriminative Omni-RewardModel-BT and the generative Omni-RewardModel-R1. Our model not only demonstrates significant improvement on Omni-RewardBench, with a 20% accuracy gain over the base model, but also achieves performance comparable to or even exceeding that of SOTA RMs on public benchmarks.

- 2 OMNI-REWARDBENCH

In this section, we introduce Omni-RewardBench, an omni-modal reward modeling benchmark with free-form preferences for evaluating the RM performance across diverse modalities. Table 7 presents a comprehensive comparison between Omni-RewardBench and existing multimodal reward modeling benchmarks. Omni-RewardBench covers 9 tasks across image, video, audio, text, and 3D modalities, and incorporates free-form preferences to support evaluating RMs under diverse criteria. Figure 5 illustrates the overall construction workflow, including prompt collection (§ 2.2), response generation (§ 2.2), criteria annotation (§ 2.3), and preference annotation (§ 2.3).

- 2.1 TASK DEFINITION AND SETTING

Each data sample in Omni-RewardBench is represented as (x,y1,y2,c,p), where x denotes the input prompt, y1 and y2 are two candidate responses generated by AI models, c specifies the free-form user preference or evaluation criterion, and p indicates the preferred response under the given criterion c. An effective RM is expected to correctly predict p given (x,y1,y2,c). We provide two evaluation settings: (1) w/o Ties (ties-excluded), where p ∈ {y1,y2}, requiring a strict preference between the two responses; (2) w/ Ties (ties-included), a more challenging setting where p ∈ {y1,y2,tie}, allowing for the case where the two responses are equally preferred under the given criterion.

tasks across diverse scenarios in RMB (Zhou et al., 2024) and RPR (Pitis et al., 2024), covering tasks like open QA, coding, and reasoning. Subsequently, we include responses generated by 13 LLMs.

Text-Image-to-Text (TI2T): TI2T denotes the image understanding task of generating textual responses based on textual instructions and image inputs. In this task, x represents a pair consisting of a user instruction and an image, and y denotes the textual response. We consider image understanding tasks with varying levels of complexity. We first collect general instructions from VL-Feedback (Li et al., 2024b), and subsequently gather meticulously constructed, layered, and complex instructions from MIA-Bench (Qian et al., 2025). The responses are collected from 14 MLLMs.

Text-Video-to-Text (TV2T): TV2T refers to the video understanding task of generating textual responses based on both textual instructions and video inputs. In this task, x indicates a user instruction and a video, and y indicates the corresponding textual response. We collect video-question pairs from VCGBench-Diverse (Maaz et al., 2024), which contains a range of video categories and diverse user questions. The durations of the selected videos range from 30 s to 358 s, with an average of 207 s. We collect responses from 4 MLLMs equipped with video understanding capabilities.

Text-Audio-to-Text (TA2T): TA2T denotes the audio understanding task of generating textual responses based on both textual instructions and audio inputs. In this task, x denotes the paired input of a user instruction and an audio clip, and y denotes the textual response. We collect diverse, open-ended questions from OpenAQA (Gong et al., 2024), each paired with an approximately 10 s audio clip. Subsequently, responses are collected from 4 MLLMs capable of audio understanding.

Text-to-Image (T2I): T2I denotes the image synthesis task of generating high-fidelity images based on user textual prompts. In this task, x denotes the textual description, and y denotes the generated image. We collect diverse manually-written prompts that reflect the general interests of model users, along with corresponding images from Rapidata (Rapidata, 2024) and HPDv2 (Wu et al., 2023a), covering 27 text-to-image models ranging from autoregressive-based to diffusion-based architectures.

Text-to-Video (T2V): T2V denotes the video synthesis task of generating temporally coherent videos from textual descriptions. In this task, x denotes the input textual description, and y denotes the corresponding generated video. We collect human-written prompts from GenAI-Bench (Jiang et al., 2024) and subsequently acquire the corresponding videos generated by up to 8 text-to-video models.

Text-to-Audio (T2A): T2A denotes the audio generation task of synthesizing audio clips with temporal and semantic consistency from textual descriptions. In this task, x denotes the textual description, and y denotes the generated audio. We collect various prompts from Audio-alpaca (Majumder et al., 2024) and responses from the latent diffusion model Tango (Ghosal et al., 2023).

Text-to-3D (T23D): T23D denotes the 3D generation task of synthesizing three-dimensional objects from textual descriptions. In this task, x is the textual prompt, and y denotes the generated 3D object. We collect user prompts from 3DRewardDB (Ye et al., 2024) and responses from the multi-view diffusion model mvdream-sd2.1-diffusers (Shi et al., 2024). The responses are presented in the multi-view rendered format of each 3D object, enabling direct image-based input to MLLMs.

Text-Image-to-Image (TI2I): TI2I denotes the image editing task of modifying an image based on textual instructions. In this task, x denotes a source image and an editing prompt, and y denotes the edited image. We collect images to be edited and user editing prompts from GenAI-Bench (Jiang et al., 2024). The responses are generated with a broad range of diffusion models.

- 2.3 CRITERIA AND PREFERENCE ANNOTATION

Following the collection of user prompts and corresponding responses, the evaluation criteria c and the user preference p are subsequently annotated. For the criteria annotation, each annotator manually creates multiple evaluation criteria in textual form based on the input x. For the preference annotation, each data sample is independently labeled by three annotators based on the free-form evaluation criteria. To ensure data quality, we first discarded 23% of instances with invalid criteria annotations, followed by 15% with conflicting preferences. The entire annotation process is conducted by three PhD students in computer science, guided by detailed guidelines and supported by an annotation platform in Appendix D. Ethics and quality control during data annotation are detailed in Appendix E. A total of 3,725 preference data are finally collected, covering 9 tasks across all modalities. More detailed statistics of Omni-RewardBench are provided in Table 8 and Table 9.

- 3 OMNI-REWARDMODEL

In this section, we first construct Omni-RewardData, a multimodal preference dataset comprising 248K general preference pairs and 69K newly collected instruction-tuning pairs with free-form preference descriptions for RM training. Based on the dataset, we propose two omni-modal RMs: Omni-RewardModel-BT (discriminative RM) and Omni-RewardModel-R1 (generative RM).

- 3.1 OMNI-REWARDDATA CONSTRUCTION

Table 1: Data statistics of Omni-RewardData.

High-quality and diverse human preference data is crucial for training effective omni-modal RMs. However, existing preference datasets are often limited in scope because they focus on specific tasks or general preferences. This limitation hinders the model’s ability to generalize to novel multimodal scenarios and adapt to multiple user preferences. To improve the generalization ability of RMs, we construct Omni-RewardData, which primarily covers four task types: T2T, TI2T, T2I, and T2V, and comprises a total of 317K preference pairs, including both general and fine-grained preferences.

(2) For TI2T, we use select 83K data from RLAIF-V (Yu et al., 2024c), a multimodal preference dataset that targets trustworthy alignment and hallucination reduction of MLLMs. Moreover, we also include 50K data from OmniAlign-V-DPO (Zhao et al., 2025), which features diverse

images, open-ended questions, and varied response formats. (3) For T2I, we sample 50K data from HPDv2 (Wu et al., 2023a), a well-annotated dataset containing human preference judgments on images generated by text-to-image generative models. In addition, we adopt EvalMuse (Han et al.,

- 2024), which provides large-scale human annotations covering both overall and fine-grained aspects of image-text alignment. (4) For T2V, we collect 10K samples from VideoDPO (Liu et al., 2024b), which evaluates both the visual quality and semantic alignment. We also integrate 2K preference pairs from VisionReward (Xu et al., 2024).

Moreover, as these data primarily reflect broadly accepted and general preferences, RMs trained solely on them often struggle to adapt reward assignment based on user-specified fine-grained preferences or customized evaluation criteria. Therefore, we propose constructing instruction-tuning data specifically for RMs, where each data instance is formatted as (c,x,y1,y2,p). We first sample preference pairs (x,y1,y2) from existing datasets, and prompt GPT-4o to generate a free-form instruction c reflecting a user preference that supports either y1 or y2, together with the corresponding label p. To ensure quality, we use GPT-4o-mini, Qwen2.5-VL 7B, and Gemma-3-12B-it to verify the consistency of (c,x,y1,y2) with the label p. We obtain the following in-house subset: (1) For T2T, we construct 24K data based on Skywork-Reward-Preference (Liu et al., 2024a) and UltraFeedback (Cui et al.,

- 2024). (2) For TI2T, we synthesize 28K data based on RLAIF-V and VLFeedback (Li et al., 2024b).

- (3) For T2I, we generate 17K data using HPDv2 and Open-Image-Preferences (is Better Together,

- 2024). The statistics of Omni-RewardData are shown in Table 1.

- 3.2 DISCRIMINATIVE REWARD MODELING WITH BRADLEY-TERRY

Following standard practice in reward modeling, we adopt the Bradley-Terry loss (Bradley & Terry, 1952) for training our discriminative RM where a scalar score is assigned to each candidate response:

LBT = −log

exp(rBT(c,x,yc)) exp(rBT(c,x,yc)) + exp(rBT(c,x,yr))

, (1)

where c denotes an optional instruction that specifies user preference, yc denotes the chosen response, yr denotes the rejected response, rBT(·) denotes the reward function. Specifically, we train Omni-RewardModel-BT on Omni-RewardData using MiniCPM-o-2.6 (Yao et al., 2024). As shown in Figure 2(1), we freeze the parameters of the vision and audio encoders, and only update the language model decoder and the value head. User-specific preferences and task-specific evaluation criteria are provided as system messages, allowing the RM to adapt its scoring behavior accordingly.

- 3.3 GENERATIVE REWARD MODELING WITH REINFORCEMENT LEARNING

To improve the interpretability of the reward scoring process, we further explore a reinforcement learning approach for training a pairwise generative reward model, denoted as Omni-RewardModel-R1. As shown in Figure 2(2), given the input (c,x,y1,y2), the model rR1(·) is required to first generate a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) explanation e, followed by a preference prediction p′. We optimize the

We train Omni-RewardModel-R1 from scratch on 10K samples from Omni-RewardData, using Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct (Bai et al., 2025) as the base model, without distillation from larger models.

- 4 EXPERIMENTS

In this section, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of a wide range of multimodal reward models, including generative RMs based on MLLMs and specialized RMs trained for task-specific objectives, as well as our proposed Omni-RewardModel. Moreover, we also extend the evaluation to include widely adopted benchmarks from prior work in multimodal reward modeling.

- 4.1 BASELINE REWARD MODELS

Generative Reward Models. We evaluate 30 generative RMs built upon state-of-the-art MLLMs, including 24 open-source and 6 proprietary models. The open-source models cover both omnimodal (e.g., Phi-4 (Abouelenin et al., 2025), Qwen2.5-Omni (Xu et al., 2025), MiniCPM-o-2.6 (Yao et al., 2024)) and vision-language models (e.g., Qwen2-VL (Wang et al., 2024b), Qwen2.5-VL (Bai et al., 2025), InternVL2.5 (Chen et al., 2024c), InternVL3 (Zhu et al., 2025a), and Gemma3 (Team, 2025)), with sizes ranging from 3B to 72B. For proprietary models, we consider the GPT (OpenAI, 2023), Gemini (DeepMind, 2025), and Claude (Anthropic, 2024a) series. Specifically, we use GPT-4o-Audio-Preview in place of GPT-4o for the TA2T and T2A tasks.

Specialized Reward Models. We evaluate several custom RMs that are specifically trained on particular reward modeling tasks. PickScore (Kirstain et al., 2023) and HPSv2 (Wu et al., 2023b)

InternLM-XComposer2.5-7BReward (Zang et al., 2025a) broadens the scope to multimodal understanding tasks that cover text, images, and videos. UnifiedReward (Wang et al., 2025) further incorporates both generation and understanding capabilities across image and video modalities.

- 4.2 IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

We conduct experiments under two evaluation settings: w/o Ties and w/ Ties. For the w/o Ties setting, we exclude all samples labeled as tie and require the model to choose the preferred response from {y1,y2}. For the w/ Ties setting, the model is required to select from {y1,y2,tie}. Accuracy is used as the primary evaluation metric. For generative RMs, we adopt a pairwise format where the model first generates explicit critiques for both responses, and then produces a final preference decision. Prompt templates for generative RMs are detailed in Appendix K. For discriminative RMs, we follow prior work (Deutsch et al., 2023) and define the w/ Ties accuracy as the maximum three-class classification accuracy obtained by varying the tie threshold. More details are shown in Appendix G.

- 4.3 EVALUATION RESULTS ON OMNI-REWARDBENCH The evaluation results on Omni-RewardBench are shown in Table 2, Table 3 and Figure 3.

Limited Performance of Current RMs. The overall performance of current RMs remains limited, particularly under the w/ Ties setting. For instance, the strongest proprietary model, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, achieves an accuracy of 66.54%, while the best-performing open-source model, Gemma-3 27B, follows closely with 65.12%. In contrast, specialized reward models perform less competitively, with the most capable one, UnifiedReward1.5, achieving only 59.69% accuracy. These results reveal

that current RMs remain inadequate for omni-modal and free-form preference reward modeling, reinforcing the need for more capable and generalizable approaches.

Modality Imbalance across Various Tasks. As shown in Figure 3, task-level performance varies considerably, with up to a 28.37% gap across modalities. In particular, tasks like T2A, T23D, and TI2I perform notably worse, highlighting a persistent modality imbalance, as current reward models primarily focus on text and image, while modalities such as audio and 3D remain underexplored.

Strong Performance of Omni-RewardModel. Omni-RewardModel-BT achieves strong performance on the Omni-RewardBench, attaining 73.68% accuracy under the w/o Ties setting and 65.36% accuracy under the w/ Ties setting. It also generalizes well to unseen modalities, achieving SOTA performance on TA2T and T2A tasks. Omni-RewardModel-R1 also surpasses existing specialized RMs in performance while providing better interpretability via explicit reasoning.

Figure 4: Performance correlation across various tasks in Omni-RewardBench.

We examine the impact of training data composition on Omni-RewardModel, focusing on two key factors: the use of mixed multimodal data and the incorporation of instruction-tuning. First, to assess the role of mixed multimodal data, we train MiniCPM-o-2.6 separately on (1) T2T, (2) TI2T, and (3) T2I and T2V data. As shown in Tables 6 and 10, while training on a single modality yields only marginal improvements, using mixed multimodal data leads to significantly better generalization across tasks. Second, to assess the role of instruction-tuning data, we remove this type of data and train MiniCPM-o-2.6 using only the general preference data in Omni-RewardData. This leads to a clear drop in performance, highlighting the importance of instruction-tuning for RMs.

- 5.2 CORRELATION OF PERFORMANCE ON DIFFERENT TASKS

We analyze RM performance across nine tasks and reveal a significant degree of performance correlation among related tasks. Specifically, we compute the Pearson correlation coefficients between tasks based on RM performance across the nine tasks in Omni-RewardBench and present the inter-task correlations as shown in Figure 4. We can observe that the performance correlations among understanding tasks, including text, image, and video understanding, are notably strong, with

Pearson coefficients ranging from 0.8 to 0.9. Similarly, generation tasks such as video, 3D, and image generation also exhibit relatively high correlations, with scores mostly between 0.7 and 0.8. These correlations suggest that RMs capture shared patterns within understanding and generation tasks, demonstrating generalization potential across modalities.

- 6.1 MULTIMODAL REWARD MODEL

Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) (Ziegler et al., 2019; Ouyang et al., 2022; Rafailov et al., 2023; Ji et al., 2024; Jin et al., 2024a; Yu et al., 2025) has emerged as an effective approach for aligning MLLMs with human preferences, thereby enhancing multimodal understanding (Zhang et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2024d; Zhao et al., 2025), reducing hallucinations (Sun et al., 2024; Yu et al., 2024a;c; Jin et al., 2024b), improving reasoning ability (Wang et al., 2024c; Huang et al., 2025), and increasing safety (Zhang et al., 2025; Yuan et al., 2025). Moreover, alignment is also beneficial for multimodal generation tasks, such as text-to-image generation (Lee et al., 2023; Liang et al., 2024; Xu et al., 2023) and text-to-video generation (Furuta et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024d; Liu et al., 2025a; Ma et al., 2025), by improving generation quality and controllability. In the alignment process, reward models are crucial for modeling human preferences and providing feedback signals that guide the model toward generating more desirable and aligned outputs. However, most existing reward models (Cobbe et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2024a; Liu et al., 2024a) primarily focus on text-to-text generation tasks, offering limited support for multimodal inputs and outputs. Recently, an increasing number of reward models have been proposed to support multimodal tasks. For example, PickScore (Liang

- et al., 2024), ImageReward (Xu et al., 2023), and HPS (Wu et al., 2023b;a) are designed to evaluate the quality of text-to-image generation. VisionReward (Xu et al., 2024), VideoReward (Liu et al.,

2025a), and VideoScore (He et al., 2024) focus on assessing text-to-video generation. LLaVA-Critic (Xiong et al., 2024) and IXC-2.5-Reward (Zang et al., 2025a) aim to align vision-language models by evaluating their instruction following and reasoning capabilities. UnifiedReward (Wang et al., 2025) is the first unified reward model for assessing both visual understanding and generation tasks. However, existing multimodal reward models remain inadequate for fully omni-modal scenarios,

6.2 REWARD MODEL EVALUATION

As the diversity of reward models expands, a growing number of benchmarks are emerging to address the need for evaluation (Jin et al., 2024c; Zheng et al., 2024; Ruan et al., 2025; Men et al., 2025). RewardBench (Lambert et al., 2024) is the first comprehensive framework for assessing RMs in chat, reasoning, and safety domains. Furthermore, RMB (Zhou et al., 2024) broadens the evaluation scope by including 49 real-world scenarios. RM-Bench (Liu et al., 2024c) is designed to evaluate RMs based on their sensitivity to subtle content differences and style biases. In the multimodal domain, several benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate reward models for image generation, such as MJ-Bench (Chen et al., 2024b) and GenAI-Bench (Jiang et al., 2024). For video generation, VideoGen-RewardBench (Liu et al., 2025a) provides a suitable benchmark for assessing visual quality, motion quality, and text alignment. More broadly, VL-RewardBench (Li et al., 2024a) and Multimodal RewardBench (Yasunaga et al., 2025) have been proposed to evaluate reward models for vision-language models. Extending further, AlignAnything (Ji et al., 2024) collects large-scale human preference data across modalities for post-training alignment and evaluates the general capabilities of omni-modal models. Meanwhile, in text-to-text generation tasks, several recent studies such as PRP (Pitis et al., 2024), HelpSteer2-Preference (Wang et al., 2024e), and GRM (Liu

- et al., 2025b) have started to focus on fine-grained reward modeling. However, existing benchmarks lack a unified framework for evaluating reward models with respect to specific textual criteria across diverse multimodal scenarios.

- 7 CONCLUSION

In this paper, we present Omni-Reward, a unified framework for omni-modal reward modeling with free-form user preferences. To address the challenges of modality imbalance and preference rigidity in current RMs, we introduce three key components: (1) Omni-RewardBench, a comprehensive RM benchmark spanning five modalities and nine diverse tasks; (2) Omni-RewardData, a largescale multimodal preference dataset incorporating both general and instruction-tuning data; and (3) Omni-RewardModel, a family of discriminative and generative RMs with strong performance.

They did not contribute to the generation of research ideas, the design of experiments, the development of methodologies, data analysis, or any substantive aspects of the research. All scientific content, conceptual contributions, and experimental results are entirely the work of the authors. The authors take full responsibility for the contents of this paper.

- B LIMITATIONS

In this section, we outline some limitations of our work. (1) Our Omni-RewardBench is a benchmark consisting of several thousand human-labeled preference pairs. Its current scale may not be sufficient to support evaluations at much larger magnitudes, such as those involving millions of examples. (2) While our benchmark covers nine distinct task types across different modalities, current task definitions remain relatively coarse, and further fine-grained categorization within each task type is desired. (3) The current preference data is limited to single-turn interactions and does not capture multi-turn conversational preferences, which are increasingly important for modeling real-world dialogue scenarios. (4) The reinforcement learning technique in training the Omni-RewardModel-R1 is limited to a preliminary exploration, and further investigation is needed. (5) Incorporating additional modalities such as thermal, radar, tabular data, and time-series data would further enhance the scope and utility of our benchmark.

- C BROADER IMPACTS

Some preference pairs in Omni-Reward may contain offensive, inappropriate, or otherwise sensitive prompts and responses, as they are intended to reflect real-world scenarios. We recommend that users exercise caution and apply their own ethical guidelines when using the dataset.

- D.2 ANNOTATION GUIDELINE

- 1. Objective This annotation task aims to identify and label evaluation dimensions under which one model response (Response A) is preferred over another (Response B), given a specific task instance (e.g., text-to-image generation, video understanding, or text-to-audio generation). The annotated dataset will serve as a foundation for building robust evaluation benchmarks that reflect nuanced human preferences across different modalities and task types.
- 2. Task Definition Each data instance consists of the following components: A task description (e.g., a prompt or instruction corresponding to a specific task category such as image generation or video analysis), Two model responses, denoted as Response A and Response B. Annotators are expected to analyze the responses and determine which aspects make one response superior to the other, focusing on concrete and interpretable evaluation dimensions (e.g., relevance, coherence, visual quality).
- 3. Annotation Procedure The annotation process involves the following steps:

- (1) Carefully read the task description and understand the intended objective.
- (2) Examine Response A and Response B in the context of the given task.
- (3) Write one or more evaluation dimension descriptions using fluent, complete English sentences. Each sentence should define a specific, human-interpretable dimension along which the two responses can be meaningfully compared.
- (4) For each evaluation dimension that you articulate, assign a comparative label among the following three:

- Response A is better,
- Response B is better, Both responses are equivalent.

- E ETHICS AND QUALITY CONTROL

- E.1 ETHICS

We confirm that all annotations were conducted voluntarily by the authors of this paper, who were fully informed about the nature and purpose of the task, their rights, and how the data would be used. We also follow the standard research ethics protocols of our institution, with explicit approval from the IRB, for all internal annotation efforts.

- E.2 QUALITY CONTROL

As illustrated in Figure 5, our annotation pipeline consists of two key stages: Criteria Annotation and Preference Annotation. Throughout these two stages, we removed a total of 38% of the samples to ensure data quality.

- • Criteria Annotation. We filtered out 23% of the samples whose criteria were deemed either too vague or overly specific, as part of our quality control on preference criteria. Such criteria would undermine the overall consistency and utility of the preference data.
- • Preference Annotation. We further removed 15% of the samples due to disagreements among annotators, where no consensus could be reached on the preferred output. To quantify inter-rater reliability, we report Krippendorff’s alpha of 0.701, indicating substantial agreement among annotators.

The annotation was carried out by a small group of PhD students. Despite the resource-intensive nature of the task, we undertook extensive measures, as documented in Appendix D, to safeguard annotation consistency and mitigate potential biases. These procedures collectively ensured that the final dataset is both ethically collected and of high quality.

Moreover, unlike broad and subjective preferences such as helpfulness or harmlessness, our benchmark provides explicit and well-defined textual criteria for each annotation instance. This design choice reduces the risk of ambiguity and limits the impact of cultural or individual variation in interpretation, thereby minimizing the potential issues arising from a lack of demographic diversity among annotators.

- F DATASET STATISTICS

- F.1 BENCHMARK COMPARISON

Table 7 presents a detailed comparison between Omni-RewardBench and existing reward modeling benchmarks. While prior benchmarks often focus on a narrow range of modalities or task types, Omni-RewardBench provides the most comprehensive coverage, spanning nine tasks across five modalities: text, image, video, audio, and 3D. Moreover, Omni-RewardBench uniquely supports free-form preference annotations, allowing more expressive and fine-grained evaluation criteria compared to the binary preferences used in most existing datasets. Notably, Table 7 shows that AlignAnything bears similarity to Omni-RewardBench. As an influential contribution, it has inspired several aspects of Omni-Reward, particularly the notion of any-to-any alignment. Nevertheless, a key distinction exists: AlignAnything concentrates on aligning omni-modal models to enhance their capabilities across diverse input–output modalities, introducing EvalAnything to assess the performance of the aligned models. By contrast, our work emphasizes reward modeling within the alignment pipeline, with Omni-RewardBench designed to directly evaluate reward models by testing whether their inferred preferences align with human judgments under specified textual criteria.

We compare the performance of ten models on OmniRewardBench and VLRewardBench, obtaining a Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.4572 between their rankings. This indicates that incorporating additional modalities and free-form criteria differentiates our benchmark from previous ones.

- F.2 OMNI-REWARDBENCH STATISTICS

Due to the inherent difficulty of collecting high-quality data across multiple modalities, some imbalance in the distribution of preference pairs is unavoidable. While some imbalance remains, our dataset maintains a relatively balanced distribution across modalities, especially when compared to the significant disparities commonly observed in real-world data availability between modalities such as images and audio.

- F.3 OMNI-REWARDDATA STATISTICS

To mitigate potential systematic biases introduced by relying solely on GPT-4o, we incorporated a multi-model verification process (Zhu et al., 2025b) to mitigate potential errors and biases introduced by GPT-4o during instruction generation. Notably, this filtering process is framed as a classification task, which is generally less complex and more robust than open-ended instruction generation, helping catch mistakes made by GPT-4o.

- Table 8: Data statistics of Omni-RewardBench. The Avg. #Tokens (Prompt), Avg. #Tokens (Response), and Avg. #Tokens (Criteria) columns report the average number of tokens in the prompt, model-generated response, and human-written evaluation criteria, respectively, all measured using the tokenizer of Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct. The Prompt Source column specifies where the prompts were collected from, while the Model column identifies which models were used to produce the corresponding responses. The letters “V”, “I”, “A”, and “D” in the table stand for Video, Image, Audio, and 3D content, respectively.

- G IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

For training Omni-RewardModel-BT, we use the LLaMA-Factory framework 1. We adopt MiniCPM-o-2.6 as the base model and freeze the parameters of the vision encoder and audio encoder. The model is trained for 2 epochs with a learning rate of 2e-6, weight decay of 1e-3, a cosine learning rate scheduler, and a warmup ratio of 1e-3. For training Omni-RewardModel-R1, we use the EasyR1 framework 2. We adopt Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct as the base model and freeze the parameters of the vision encoder. The model is trained for 2 epochs with a learning rate of 1e-6, weight decay of 1e-2, and a rollout number of 6. We use vllm 3 for open-source MLLM inference. All experiments are conducted on 4×A100 80GB GPUs. For evaluation, we compute the overall score by averaging the performance across all modalities supported by a given model.

- I ADDITIONAL ANALYSIS

- I.1 EFFECT OF CHAIN-OF-THOUGHT REASONING

We investigate the impact of chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning on the final predictions produced by generative RMs. We evaluate the RMs under two settings: (1) w/o CoT, where the model directly generates a preference judgment; and (2) w/ CoT, where the model first generates a textual critic before providing the final judgment. As shown in Figures 7 and 8, CoT exhibits a two-fold effect: it enhances performance in weaker models by compensating for limited capacity through intermediate reasoning, whereas in stronger models, it yields little to no improvement and may even slightly degrade performance, likely because such models already internalize sufficient reasoning capabilities.

- I.2 EFFECT OF FREE-FORM CRITERIA

To illustrate the challenge posed by free-form criteria in Omni-RewardBench, we conduct a quantitative experiment comparing model performance when inherent preferences align or conflict with these criteria. Specifically, we elicit each model’s inherent preferences without criteria, compare them against the ground-truth annotations, and partition the data into two groups: invariant (agreement between inherent and criteria-based preferences) and shifted (conflict between them). Model accuracy is evaluated separately under the free-form criteria for both groups, with substantially lower performance in the shifted group. The results show that GPT-4o-mini suffers an average accuracy drop of 26.32%, while Claude-3.5-Sonnet shows an 18.50% drop.

- I.3 EFFECT OF SCORING STRATEGY

We investigate the impact of two scoring strategies for generative reward models: pointwise and pairwise. Pointwise approach assigns a scalar score to each response individually, and predictions are subsequently derived from score comparisons. By contrast, pairwise approach involves a directly comparison between the responses to identify the superior one. We conduct experiments on Omni-RewardBench, and as shown in Figure 11, the pairwise scoring strategy significantly outperforms the pointwise variant.

The video opens with a close-up of vibrant pink and yellow roses amid lush green foliage, with the Roger's Gardens logo in the bottom left. It then shows a hand holding a box of Dr. Earth Total Advantage Rose & Flower Fertilizer. An individual stands among blooming red rose bushes, likely in a garden center or well-kept garden. They hold a handful of rich soil, followed by a table displaying gardening products like Safer Insect Killing Soap and Monterey B.t. RTU. The video briefly highlights rose foliage with yellow speckles and shows Safer 3in-1 Garden Spray. It ends with the person standing among the flowering bushes before fading to black.

The video begins with a close-up of blooming pink roses in a vibrant garden. The camera pans to a woman standing among the flowers, holding a bag of "Dr. Earth Total Advantage Rose & Flower Fertilizer." She pours the fertilizer around the base

|(GPT-4 Audio Preview) Answer: In evaluating the responses, we consider how well each one details the audio characteristics and relates them to a possible time of day for the recording.\n\n**Response A** posits that the clip was recorded in the early morning or late evening based on typical train schedules. However, it does not delve into the specific sounds within the audio clip itself, missing an opportunity to tie those sounds directly to the likely time of day of the recording.\n\n**Response B** acknowledges the challenge in determining the exact time of day but then suggests various possibilities based on different audio characteristics that might be present in a clip. It provides a more nuanced analysis by categorizing potential sounds that could be indicative of morning, daytime, or evening times. However, it remains vague and does not directly address the actual content of the audio clip to make a more informed guess.\n\nGiven that the evaluation criteria focus on a detailed description of the audio characteristics, Response B provides a more thorough analysis by discussing potential sounds and their associated times of day, even though it lacks a direct reference to the specific sounds in the provided clip. Therefore, Response B is stronger in its detail and considered approach to analyzing the audio characteristics.\n\n[[B]]<br><br>[Figure 76]|

Criteria: The owlfolk character should have a balanced composition in its facial features, exhibiting a clear axis of symmetry, which is typical in character portraiture to enhance aesthetic appeal.

- Preference: [[Response B]]

|(GPT-4o) Answer: In evaluating both responses, I will focus on the symmetry and balanced composition of the owlfolk character's facial features.<br><br>- **Response A:** The owlfolk character displays a symmetrical composition that is traditionally appealing. Both eyes are proportionally aligned and equidistant from the center. The beak serves as the central axis that contributes to symmetry, creating an aesthetically pleasing portrait. The feathers framing the face also exhibit consistency in length and placement, enhancing the symmetrical look. The dramatic lighting highlights these features effectively, keeping the focus on the facial symmetry.<br>- **Response B:** The character's facial features demonstrate symmetry as well, with eyes positioned equidistantly from the central glowing beak-like structure. However, the exaggerated stylistic portrayal of feathers creates some variation in the perceived symmetry - more abstract, rather than detailed. The lighting is dramatic and creates highlights and shadows, but the symmetrical impact is less traditionally structured compared to Response A.<br><br><br>Considering the criteria of symmetry in facial features, Response A presents a more balanced composition with clear symmetry, while Response B offers a more artistic, stylized representation where symmetry, although present, is obscured by artistic choices.<br><br>Therefore, based on the symmetry and composition criteria outlined, I find Response A to better meet the prompt requirement of balanced facial symmetry in an owlfolk character.<br><br>[[A]]<br><br>[Figure 79]|

Criteria: The ball should be clearly visible, with appropriate size and consistent movement that matches the physics of a

rolling or bouncing ball.

Preference: [[Response B]]

|(GPT-4o) Answer: To evaluate the quality of the two responses based on the prompt "a cute dog is playing a ball," I will focus on the visibility and movement of the ball:<br><br>**Response A:**<br><br>- The ball is clearly visible in all frames.<br>- The size and shape of the ball are consistent throughout the images.<br>- The ball appears to be rolling or bouncing in front of the dog, showing realistic movement.<br><br><br>**Response B:**<br><br><br>- The ball is not present in any of the frames.<br>- Instead, the frames show a cartoonish depiction of a dog-like creature holding a toy which could resemble a ball but does not show any movement or play aspect.<br>- There is no depiction of a ball rolling or bouncing, which does not align with the criteria of the rolling or bouncing movement that matches physics.<br><br><br>Based on the evaluation criteria, Response A clearly meets the prompt requirements of showcasing a dog playing with a ball through visible and realistic movement. Thus, Response A better aligns with the prompt.<br><br>The verdict is "[[A]]."<br><br>[Figure 88]|

Audio

Preference: [[Response B]]

|(GPT-4 Audio Preview) Answer: In evaluating the responses, we consider how well each one details the audio characteristics and relates them to a possible time of day for the recording.\n\n**Response A** posits that the clip was recorded in the early morning or late evening based on typical train schedules. However, it does not delve into the specific sounds within the audio clip itself, missing an opportunity to tie those sounds directly to the likely time of day of the recording.\n\n**Response B** acknowledges the challenge in determining the exact time of day but then suggests various possibilities based on different audio characteristics that might be present in a clip. It provides a more nuanced analysis by categorizing potential sounds that could be indicative of morning, daytime, or evening times. However, it remains vague and does not directly address the actual content of the audio clip to make a more informed guess.\n\nGiven that the evaluation criteria focus on a detailed description of the audio characteristics, Response B provides a more thorough analysis by discussing potential sounds and their associated times of day, even though it lacks a direct reference to the specific sounds in the provided clip. Therefore, Response B is stronger in its detail and considered approach to analyzing the audio characteristics.\n\n[[B]]<br><br>[Figure 91]|

Criteria: The sword should appear structurally plausible, with parts connected in a manner indicating it could function as a real weapon.

Preference: [[Response B]]

|(GPT-4o) Answer: Let's analyze the responses according to the specific criteria: "The sword should appear structurally plausible, with parts connected in a manner indicating it could function as a real weapon."<br><br>**Response A**<br><br>- The sword has a green and brown handle, which matches the given prompt.<br>- The blade has a reasonable shape, suitable for a sword, and the metal accents are visible near the hilt.<br>- However, the sword's design does not show an obvious attached chain, as the prompt specifies.<br>- While it appears overall structurally plausible, the absence of the chain from the prompt is a significant oversight.<br><br><br>**Response B**<br><br><br>- This sword features a brown handle with metal accents, aligning well with the prompt.<br>- It also includes a chain attached to the pommel, which fulfills that part of the prompt.<br>- The blade and overall shape of the sword are practical and realistic, suggesting it could function as a real weapon.<br>- The connection points of the handle, guard, and blade are convincingly rendered.<br><br><br>In conclusion, comparing the critical elements of structural plausibility and prompt adherence, **Response B** provides a sword that better matches the given criteria by incorporating all parts of the design, including the chain, and ensuring a structurally sound and plausible appearance.<br><br>Therefore, the analysis shows that [[B]] is better.<br><br>[Figure 100]|

Criteria: 'The location of the coffee in original

image should clearly show a cup of beer instead, with the beer\'s distinctive features

such as foam and color easily identifiable,

ensuring it is not mistaken for coffee.

Preference: [[Response B]]

|(GPT-4o) Answer: To evaluate both responses, we need to assess how effectively each replaces the original<br><br>coffee cup with a beer while maintaining identifiable beer characteristics such as foam and color.<br><br>**Response A:**<br><br>- The original coffee cup has been transformed into what resembles a glass of beer.<br>- The glass has distinct foam at the top, which is characteristic of beer.<br>- The color of the liquid has a beer-like appearance, with a light amber hue.<br>- The design from the original cup (the apples) has been retained on the beer glass, which may be unusual but the transformation into a beer is visually identifiable.<br><br><br>**Response B:**<br><br><br>- The original image now shows multiple beer glasses with a foamy head, which is characteristic of beer.<br>- The glasses have a clear beer-like amber color, making them recognizable as beers.<br>- However, the presence of multiple glasses and changes to the other elements (cupcake being topped with what looks like beer foam) in the image may distract from the original task, which was to replace the coffee with beer.<br><br><br>In conclusion, both responses appropriately incorporate beer characteristics at the location of the coffee.<br><br>However, Response A is more aligned with the original prompt as it focuses on replacing the coffee with one<br><br>cup/glass of beer and maintains the context of the surrounding elements. Response B might be seen as<br><br>excessive with multiple glasses and modifications.<br><br>**Final Verdict: [[A]]**<br><br>[Figure 104]|
