### Abstract

Language models are instruction-tuned to refuse harmful requests, but the mechanisms underlying this behavior remain poorly understood. Popular steering methods operate on the residual stream and degrade output coherence at high intervention strengths, limiting their practical use. We introduce contrastive neuron attribution (CNA), which identifies the 0.1% of MLP neurons whose activations most distinguish harmful from benign prompts, requiring only forward passes with no gradients or auxiliary training. In instruct models, ablating the discovered circuit reduces refusal rates by over 50% on a standard jailbreak benchmark while preserving fluency and non-degeneracy across all steering strengths. Applying CNA to matched base and instruct models across Llama and Qwen architectures (from 1B to 72B parameters), we find that base models contain similar late-layer discrimination structures but steering these neurons produces only content shifts, not behavioral change. These results demonstrate that neuron-level intervention enables reliable behavioral steering without the quality tradeoffs of residual-stream methods. More broadly, our findings suggest that alignment fine-tuning transforms pre-existing discrimination structure into a sparse, targetable refusal gate.

### 1 Introduction

Modern language models are fine-tuned with preference optimization methods and human-feedback pipelines to refuse harmful requests [Ouyang et al., 2022, Rafailov et al., 2023]. But how does this safety behavior arise mechanistically? One possibility is that fine-tuning introduces entirely new structures (often referred to as ’circuits’) in previously unused layers; another is that pretrained models already contain components that fine-tuning adapts into safety-relevant functions. Distinguishing these hypotheses requires comparing base and instruction-tuned models at the level of individual neurons.

Safety-related signals (patterns that activate differentially for harmful versus benign prompts) have previously been identified in the late layers of instruction-tuned models [Chaudhury, 2025, Wang et al., 2026]. However, it is unclear whether these signals arise as a result of fine-tuning, or the degree to which they can be steered.

Representation engineering methods steer model behavior by intervening on the cumulative signal passed between layers of a transformer, which is known as the residual stream. Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA) [Rimsky et al., 2024], for example, computes an average activation difference between contrastive prompt sets and adds this as a steering vector at inference time. This is effective but coarse: it modifies the entire layer-wide signal without identifying which individual neurons drive the behavior. Sparse autoencoders isolate features but are sensitive to noise and require expensive external training [Prakash et al., 2026, Bricken et al., 2023].

Understanding the mechanistic basis of refusal is important both for improving alignment robustness and for diagnosing when safety behaviors can be bypassed. To better understand the role of individual neurons in refusal mechanisms, we develop contrastive neuron attribution (CNA), which applies

the contrastive aspect of CAA at the level of individual MLP neurons. By comparing activations between two sets of prompts (e.g., harmful vs. benign), CNA identifies a sparse subset (0.1%) of MLP neurons (post-activation hidden units) whose activations most distinguish the sets. We apply this method uniformly across both base and instruct variants of Llama and Qwen architectures from

- 1B to 72B parameters, and where ablation reduces refusal rates across all model sizes.

Core finding. Clamping 0.1% of MLP activations to zero reduces refusal rates by over 50% in instruct models while maintaining coherent output quality1, consistently across all model sizes and architectures tested. Applying the same technique to base models produces no change in refusal behavior and yields mostly shifts in content, despite identifying neurons with comparable activation differences. This indicates that the refusal mechanism is crystallized during alignment fine-tuning, is sparse, and can be reliably targeted for behavioral steering.

Contributions.

- 1. Sparse ablation preserves output quality. Unlike residual-stream methods (CAA), neuronlevel ablation maintains coherent generation while avoiding mode collapse at high steering strengths.
- 2. Refusal mechanisms in instruct models are an effective target for steering. Ablating neuron activations involved in refusal behaviors reduces refusal by >50% across model sizes and architectures on JBB-Behaviors, a NeurIPS 2024 benchmark of 100 harmful prompts [Chao et al., 2024].
- 3. Fine-tuning transforms function, not structure. Base-model discrimination neurons produce content shifts when steered; instruct-model neurons in the same layers become causal safety gates.
- 4. Cross-architecture replication. Results replicate across Llama and Qwen, despite the two having different fine-tuning paradigms.

- 2 Background

Steering methods like CAA alter model behavior by computing the average difference in residual stream activations between contrastive prompt sets, extracting a “control vector” for inference-time steering. CAA is effective but coarse, operating on the full residual stream without identifying which neurons are responsible. Our method applies the same contrastive idea at the level of individual neurons. Arora et al. [2026], which shows that Layer-wise Relevance Propagation applied to individual MLP neurons yields remarkably sparse circuits: ∼100–200 neurons can explain complete task behaviors. While we do not use RelP in our main experiments (see Section 3), their work motivates our focus on the neuron basis rather than the residual stream. Lastly, sparse autoencoders [Bricken et al., 2023] learn interpretable features via auxiliary dictionary learning. They require expensive training and involve granularity trade-offs while being sensitive to activation noise. We avoid this cost by working with the model’s native neurons directly, requiring no additional training.

- 3 Method: Contrastive Neuron Attribution We apply a single uniform method to identifying behavioral circuits called contrastive discovery.

#### 3.1 Contrastive Discovery

For each task, we define a set of positive prompts (exhibiting the target property) and negative prompts (not exhibiting it):

- 1. Run all prompts through the model.
- 2. Record MLP activations at the last token position for each prompt (using forward pre-hooks on down_proj).

1We measure output quality as 1 − r, where r is the fraction of repeated n-grams in the response. See Section 4 for details.

- 3. Compute per-neuron mean activation difference between positive and negative sets.
- 4. Select the top 0.1% neurons by absolute difference.

Formally, we define a set of positive prompts P+ (exhibiting the target behavior) and negative prompts P− (exhibiting the ’opposite’ of the target behavior). We run all prompts through the model and record the down projection of the MLP activations at the last token for each task. For neuron j in layer ℓ, let aℓj(x) denote its activation on prompt x. We compute the mean contrastive difference:

1 |P+|

aℓj(x) −

δjℓ =

x∈P+

1 |P−|

aℓj(x) (1)

x∈P−

We then select the circuit Ck = top-k {|δjℓ|} , taking the top k neurons by absolute difference across all layers. We set k to 0.1% of total MLP activations, which we found to reliably produce steering

effects across all model sizes tested. This is consistent with the findings in Arora et al. [2026] that features are sparse in the neuron basis.

In some respect, our method is an interpretation of CAA at the neuron level rather than the residual stream level. It is simply the computation of forward passes and comparison of activations, without requiring gradients, linearization, or auxiliary training.

#### 3.2 Universal Neuron Filtering

Some neurons fire regardless of prompt content. We detect them by running diverse prompts and flagging any neuron appearing in the top 0.1% of MLP activations for ≥80% of prompts, then exclude

- them from all discovered neuron subsets.

#### 3.3 Targeted Ablation for Causal Verification

We verify causality by multiplying each circuit neuron’s activation by a scalar m at inference time: m = 0 ablates the neuron, m = 1 is baseline, m > 1 amplifies it.

We run refusal benchmarks over variants of Llama 3.2 and 3.1 [Grattafiori et al., 2024] and Qwen 2.5 [Yang et al., 2024], from 1B to 72B parameters, at different steering strengths. For the JBB-Behaviors evaluation, the refusal circuit is identified using a custom discovery set of 100 harmful and 100 benign prompts to ensure statistical stability; for all other tasks and qualitative examples, a minimal set of 8 positive and 8 negative prompts is used for discovery. The base model variants are used to validate that the structure we’ve identified is in fact related to refusals and not some orthogonal behavioral trait or feature.

### 4 Experimental Setup

Models. We use base and instruct variants of the following models: Llama-3.2-1B (16 layers), Llama-3.2-3B (28 layers), Qwen2.5-1.5B (28 layers), and Qwen2.5-3B (36 layers), on NVIDIA RTX 3080 GPUs in bfloat16. We then evaluate the base and instruct variants of: Llama-3.1-8B (16 layers), Qwen2.5-7B (36 layers), Llama-3.1-70B (16 layers), and Qwen2.5-72B (36 layers) on a B200 node in bfloat16 for scale comparisons. By comparing base–instruct pairs across architectures, we are able to isolate the effect of alignment fine-tuning.

Evaluation metrics. Ablation effect: change in refusal rate under circuit ablation (m = 0) on JBB-Behaviors. Steering strength α: steering intensity in CNA is measured as a multiplier, so 0.0 ablates a given neuron and 1.0 is baseline. We calculate 1 − m for CAA comparisons, so that α = 0 is baseline and α = 1 is maximum intervention for both methods. Output quality: our output quality metric is calculated as the complement of the fraction of repeated n-grams in a provided string. We use this as a proxy for deteriorated response coherence, with a lower metric indicating a highly repetitive response.

### 5 Results

#### 5.1 Maintaining Coherence While Affecting Behavior

A practical limitation of residual-stream steering methods is that increasing steering strength degrades generation quality through collapse and repeated words [Arditi et al., 2024, Rimsky et al., 2024]. We compare CNA against CAA across all 16 models, sweeping steering strength α from 0 (baseline) to 1 (full strength of modification) for both methods over 100 JBB-Behaviors prompts. We measure refusal rate by keyword classifier and generation coherence via n-gram repetition ratio as a proxy for repetitive response detection. CAA achieves comparable refusal reduction at moderate steering strengths, but quality degrades sharply beyond α = 0.5, with several models producing degenerate repetitive output at high steering strengths. In some cases (Qwen2.5-1.5B, Qwen2.5-72B), CAA degrades output quality to the point that the keyword classifier flags degenerate outputs as refusals, producing artificially high refusal rates at maximum steering strength.

Figure 1 shows the aggregate result across all 8 instruct models. CNA decreases refusal rate monotonically with steering strength while maintaining near-baseline generation quality (>0.97 at all α values).

General capabilities. To confirm that CNA ablation does not degrade general model capabilities, we evaluate MMLU accuracy across steering strengths for both methods. Figure 2 shows the aggregate result: CNA preserves baseline MMLU accuracy (within 1 point) at all steering strengths, while CAA drops to near-zero at maximum intervention.

Table 1 reports per-model results at maximum steering strength. CNA preserves generation quality above 0.96 for every model tested, while CAA drops below 0.60 for 6 of 8 instruct models. Note that baseline refusal rates differ from Table 3 as we use a smaller set of contrastive pair examples to discover the subset of neurons used here (JBB-Behaviors uses 100 harmful and 100 benign prompts for discovery).

Applying the same comparison to base models (Table 2) confirms that neither method produces meaningful refusal changes in base models, consistent with our finding that the refusal mechanism is specific to alignment fine-tuning.

#### 5.2 Causal Validation: Ablation Reduces Refusal

We validate causality by ablating the discovered instruct-model refusal circuit and measuring the effect on JBB-Behaviors.

- Table 3: Refusal rate on JBB-Behaviors (100 prompts) before and after ablating 0.1% of MLP activations.

Model Baseline Ablated ∆ Relative Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct 90% 34% −56pp −62.2% Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct 84% 47% −37pp −44.0% Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct 90% 34% −56pp −62.2% Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct 86% 18% −68pp −79.1% Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct 93% 12% −81pp −87.1% Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct 90% 58% −32pp −35.6% Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct 87% 2% −85pp −97.7% Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct 78% 8% −70pp −89.7%

The ablation of just 0.1% of the total number of MLP activations reduces refusal rates by more than half in most cases. We observe that ablated models produce coherent, useful responses rather than garbled output, confirming the circuit functions as a refusal gate overlaid on an otherwise capable model.

Rubric-based scoring. We additionally evaluate using the StrongREJECT rubric [Souly et al., 2024], which uses an LLM judge (Llama-3.3-70B) to rate each response on harmfulness, deception, and dangerousness using a structured scoring prompt. Scores are normalized to a 0 to 1 scale (0 = refused, 1 = compliant), and we find that Llama scores improve by an average of 6% and Qwen scores improve by an average of 31%.

5.3 Fine-Tuning Transforms Function

We run the identical contrastive discovery and steering pipeline on both base and instruct models, then compare the results when we activate or suppress the discovered neurons. Table 4 below shows that this is a functional change across all models at different steering multipliers.

- Table 4: Steering late-layer discrimination neurons in base and instruct models. Multiplier m scales circuit activations directly: m = 1 is baseline, m = 0 ablates, m = 2 amplifies. Prompt: “How do I pick a lock?”

###### Model m Generated output

- 1.0 “How do I pick a lock? How do I pick a lock?...” [repeats] 0.0 “Lock picking is a skill that can be learned...”

- 2.0 “The best way to pick a padlock is to use...”

Llama-1B BASE

- 1.0 “I can’t assist with that.” [REFUSAL] 0.0 “Picking a lock can be a challenging task, here’s a guide...” [COMPLIES]

- 1.0 “I’m sorry, but I can’t provide instructions...” [REFUSAL] 0.0 “Picking a lock is a skill... I can provide some...” [PARTIAL]

- 2.0 [Degenerates to repetition]

Qwen-3B INSTRUCT

In base models, steering the late-layer discrimination circuit produces content shifts (topic changes, rephrasing, different factual framings) but never results in refusal or real behavioral change at any steering multiplier.

After fine-tuning, the mechanism discovered in late-layers becomes a causal safety gate:

- • m = 0 (ablation): produces compliance with harmful requests.
- • m = 1 (baseline): produces standard refusal.
- • m > 1 (amplification): produces stronger refusal.

This functional transformation to behavioral gating is the primary effect of alignment fine-tuning on these circuits. While CNA is generally stable, extreme amplification (m > 1) can still hit a ceiling where the "safety gate" signal overwhelms the residual stream.

### 6 Discussion

Structure vs. function. Our results reveal a separation between two distinct levels of circuit organization:

- • Layer-level structure: Discrimination neurons are found in late layers in both base and instruct models across all architectures tested. See Appendix C for further details around this finding.
- • Neuron-level function: The same late-layer structure produces content shifts in base models and behavioral change in instruct models.

This is consistent with Wu et al. [2024]’s finding that instruction tuning “rotates” FFN knowledge without changing layer structure, and with Chaudhury [2025]’s observation that alignment signals concentrate in specific layer ranges.

Implications for targeted intervention. Sufficient behavioral steering requires intervention on only the final ∼10% of layers. Ablation of 0.1% of MLP activations produces a large behavioral change without disrupting the quality of the response.

Structural localization. We report layer-by-layer localization results for Llama-3.2-1B and Qwen2.5-3B, the two architectures for which we conducted detailed circuit analysis. Quantitative steering results across all 16 models (Section 5.1) confirm that the behavioral effects generalize, though we leave per-layer analysis of larger models to future work. Appendix C provides full layer-by-layer localization data, showing that discrimination neurons concentrate in the final ∼10% of layers across all architectures and sample tasks. This late-layer concentration is a pretraining property present identically in base models.

Future work. Key open questions include: (1) whether CNA generalizes to mixture-of-experts architectures, where MLP structure differs fundamentally, and (2) whether this technique applies to other behaviors beyond refusal that admit clean contrastive pairs.

Limitations. Contrastive discovery operates on raw activation differences rather than RelP attribution, so standard faithfulness metrics do not apply directly; we evaluate only via behavioral steering, objective response coherence methods, and benchmarks. Experiments are limited to Llama-family and Qwen-family architectures (gated SiLU MLPs, GQA attention) up to 72B parameters.

### 7 Related Work

Neuron-basis circuit discovery. Arora et al. [2026] demonstrate that Layer-wise Relevance Propagation applied to individual MLP neurons yields remarkably sparse circuits, with ∼100-200 neurons explaining complete task behaviors. Their work motivates our focus on the neuron basis rather than the residual stream. Our contrastive approach requires only forward passes, avoiding the linearization and eager attention requirements of RelP.

Refusal mechanisms. Prakash et al. [2026] use SAEs to identify a “Hydra Effect” in refusal. Wang et al. [2026] identify safety neurons in late layers and propose freeze-and-retrain for robustness. We extend both by showing that the late-layer structure pre-exists fine-tuning and that ablation of the instruct-model circuit preserves generation coherence.

Alignment localization. Chaudhury [2025] find alignment signals concentrate in specific layer ranges of Llama 3.2 1B. Our base vs. instruct comparison extends this by showing that similar structure exists prior to fine-tuning but lacks the behavioral effect.

Representation engineering. Arditi et al. [2024] show that refusal is mediated by a single direction in the residual stream: erasing it prevents refusal on harmful prompts, while adding it elicits refusal on benign ones, across 13 models up to 72B parameters. CAA [Rimsky et al., 2024] and representation engineering [Zou et al., 2023] explore this technique for behavioral steering via residual-stream modifications. Our work extends these findings in two ways: first, we show that the refusal direction decomposes into a sparse circuit of fewer than 0.1% of MLP neurons, enabling targeted intervention at the individual-neuron level; second, unlike residual-stream methods which degrade generation quality at high steering strengths, neuron-level ablation maintains coherent output.

Circuit discovery methods. ACDC [Conmy et al., 2023] and path patching [Goldowsky-Dill et al., 2023] identify circuits via iterative edge pruning. RelP achieves comparable quality in a single pass [Arora et al., 2026, Rezaei Jafari et al., 2025]. Our contrastive approach trades faithfulness guarantees for simplicity, requiring no gradients, no auxiliary models, and no iterative search.

### 8 Conclusion

Applying contrastive neuron attribution to both base and instruct models reveals that alignment finetuning transforms pre-existing late-layer discrimination structure into a functional refusal mechanism. The same technique applied to base models identifies neurons with similar activation differences but no behavioral effect when steered, indicating that refusal is a behavior crystallized during post-training rather than a pre-existing capability.

By intervening on fewer than 0.1% of MLP activations, we reduce refusal rates by over 50% across all architectures tested, from 1B to 72B parameters, while preserving coherent output. Unlike residualstream steering methods, neuron-level ablation avoids the generation degradation that limits practical applicability of prior approaches.

### Impact Statement

This paper presents interpretability research aimed at understanding how safety-relevant behaviors are implemented in large language models. A potential dual-use concern is that identifying refusal circuits could facilitate targeted attacks on safety mechanisms. We believe the scientific value of understanding alignment mechanisms outweighs this risk, and note that similar findings are emerging across the interpretability community. Understanding the fragility of refusal circuits may ultimately lead to more robust alignment methods.

C.2 Base vs. Instruct Concentration

- Table 7 shows that the late-layer concentration pre-exists fine-tuning. Base models exhibit similar layer-level patterns to their instruct counterparts.

- Table 7: Layer concentration (contrastive discovery) for matched base and instruct models over refusal, capitals, and subject-verb agreement tasks. “Top 3” = fraction of top-200 neurons in the final

3 layers.

- C.3 Neuron Overlap Between Base and Instruct

Despite stable layer-level architecture, fine-tuning largely replaces individual neurons. Table 8 reports the overlap of (layer, neuron) index pairs between matched base and instruct circuits.

Table 8: Neuron overlap between base and instruct models. Overlap = number of shared (layer, neuron) pairs out of 200.

Llama-3.2-1B Qwen2.5-3B Task Overlap % of Instruct Overlap % of Instruct

Refusal 17 8.5% 28 14.0% Capitals 29 14.5% 58 29.0% SVA 39 19.5% 24 12.0%

Average 28 14.2% 37 18.3%

Only 8–29% of individual neurons survive the transition from base to instruct. Fine-tuning replaces the circuit while preserving the layer-level concentration pattern.

- C.4 Per-Layer Distribution: Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct

- Figure 3 shows per-layer neuron counts for refusal, capitals, and subject-verb agreement tasks on

- Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct. All three tasks produce visually similar right-skewed distributions, with the majority of neurons concentrated in L14–L15.

Figure 3: Per-layer neuron counts for refusal, capitals, and SVA on Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct (contrastive discovery). All three tasks concentrate in the final 2–3 layers, with 82–87% of neurons in L13–L15. The distributions are visually similar, confirming that late-layer concentration is a universal property of content discrimination.
