### Abstract

While Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) effectively aligns pretrained Large Language and VisionLanguage Models (LLMs, and VLMs) with human preferences, its computational cost and complexity hamper its wider adoption. To alleviate some of the computational burden of fine-tuning, parameter efficient methods, like LoRA (Hu et al., 2021) were introduced. In this work, we empirically evaluate the setup of Parameter Efficient Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (PE-RLHF) that leverages LoRA fine-tuning for Reward Modeling, and Reinforcement Learning. We benchmark the PE-RLHF setup on six diverse datasets spanning summarization, harmless/helpful response generation, UI automation, and visual question answering in terms of effectiveness of the trained models, and the training resources required. Our findings show, for the first time, that PE-RLHF achieves comparable performance to RLHF, while significantly reducing training time (up to 90% faster for reward models, and 30% faster for RL), and memory footprint (up to 50% reduction for reward models, and 27% for RL). We provide comprehensive ablations across LoRA ranks, and model sizes for both reward modeling and reinforcement learning. By mitigating the computational burden associated with RLHF, we push for a broader adoption of PE-RLHF as an alignment technique for LLMs and VLMs.

### 1 Introduction

Large Language and Vision-Language Models (LLMs, and VLMs) like GPT-4 (OpenAI et al., 2023) and Gemini (Team et al., 2023; Reid et al., 2024) demonstrate remarkable performance across diverse tasks. However, aligning

these models with human preferences remains crucial for ensuring desirable behavior (Bommasani et al., 2022). This alignment improves instruction following (Ouyang et al., 2022), and facilitates optimizing for behaviors that lack a clear mathematical loss function, such as safety properties (Bai et al., 2022a,b; Glaese et al., 2022), helpfulness (Bai et al., 2022a; Glaese

- et al., 2022), summarization characteristics (Stiennon et al., 2020), and visual instructions (Sun
- et al., 2023). Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a prominent method for achieving this alignment. It involves training a reward model (RM) on human feedback data, and subsequently using this RM to fine-tune the model parameters via Reinforcement Learning (RL). While effective (Stiennon et al., 2020; Bai et al., 2022b), RLHF’s complexity and computational demands hinder its widespread adoption. Moreover, the RL loop necessitates extra model copies - such as for the reward model, and the anchor model used for KL regularization - which significantly increases its memory usage in comparison to standard fine-tuning.

We compare standard RLHF, where all the parameters of the reward model and policy are fine-tuned, to Parameter-Efficient Reinforcement Learning, which leverages LoRA (LowRank Adaptation) (Hu et al., 2021) for finetuning both the reward model, and the reinforcement learning policy. While more powerful Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) and Representation Fine-Tuning (ReFT) approaches have been developed since LoRA, our study focuses on this method, as it is widely adopted. We hope our results will motivate the benchmarking of other PEFT and ReFT approaches on RLHF tasks. Despite training only a small fraction of the parameters, we demonstrate that the results obtained with PE-RLHF

are on par with those obtained with standard RLHF.

Figure 2 illustrates the differences between PE-RLHF and standard RLHF.

Our contributions are threefold:

- • Thorough Comparative Analysis: We conducted an extensive evaluation of PERLHF against standard RLHF methods across six diverse datasets and five distinct tasks. While LoRA’s efficiency was expected, its surprisingly strong performance establishes it as a superior alternative to full fine-tuning for RLHF. Detailed results are presented in Table 1.
- • In-depth Ablation studies: We systematically examined the influence of LoRA on both RM and RL policy training, considering variations in model size and LoRA ranks.
- • Demonstrated Resource Savings: We provide empirical measurements demonstrating reductions in memory consumption and training time achieved by PERLHF as compared with standard RLHF.

We hope that this study will pave the way for more efficient and accessible RLHF, promoting wider adoption and facilitating the development of large models that better align with human preferences.

### 2 Parameter Efficient Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback

RLHF involves two phases: reward model training, and reinforcement learning of a policy model. PE-RLHF applies parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques to optimize both of these training phases, thus significantly reducing the memory requirements, and increasing the training speed. We provide a brief overview on RLHF in Appendix A.1.

#### 2.1 Reward Model Training

PE-RLHF constructs reward models as language models with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) adapters. These adapters are attached to each attention projection matrix within the model. During training, only the adapters are trained, while the language model backbone

remains frozen. This approach, illustrated in Figure 1, significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters. During inference, the trained LoRA adapters are combined with the projection matrices through a one-time addition operation. This results in a reward model functionally equivalent to a non-LoRA model, but trained efficiently.

#### 2.2 Reinforcement Learning of Policy

Similarly, PE-RLHF uses LoRA adapters for policy and value models within the reinforcement learning loop. As with the reward model, adapters are attached to each attention projection matrix, and trained while keeping the language model backbone frozen (Figure 2). The policy is then optimized using the policy gradient calculated based on the value model. The value model is trained using the reward score, along with KL regularization with the anchor policy. We optimize the policy using “REINFORCE for Language Models”, as used by Lee et al. (2023a).

### 3 Datasets and Tasks

We describe the datasets we used for training the reward models, and performing reinforcement learning, categorized by their respective tasks. Our experiments are based on a diverse collection of datasets, and test various capabilities of language models. This diversity allows

- Table 1: PE-RLHF RM training can match standard RM training in terms of reward model accuracy while using 43-74% of the HBM at peak and trains 1.4-1.9× faster as compared to standard RM training. PE-RLHF can match the standard RLHF while using 73-80% HBM at peak, and training 1.15-1.3× faster.

us to evaluate the efficacy PE-RLHF across different domains, and assess its ability to generalize to new tasks. The datasets are grouped into the following categories:

Text Summarization: These datasets test a model’s ability to condense information, and generate concise summaries. We experiment with the Reddit TL;DR (Völske et al., 2017; Stiennon et al., 2020), and BOLT Message Summarization (Chen et al., 2018) datasets. The Reddit TL;DR dataset contains Reddit posts together with human-annotated summaries, used to train models for summarizing these posts.

We filtered this dataset following the work of Stiennon et al. (2020). The BOLT Message Summarization dataset contains chat conversations, used to train models for summarizing sequences of messages.

Harmless Response Generation: Generating harmless responses is critical to the development of responsible AI systems. We use the “Harmlessness" dataset from Anthropic-HH (Bai et al., 2022a). This dataset evaluates a model’s ability to generate safe responses to red-teaming prompts.

Helpful Response Generation: This task asks the model to provide helpful answer for a given question. We use Stanford Human Preference dataset (Ethayarajh et al., 2022) to evaluate the helpfulness of the generated answer.

UI Automation: This task assesses the model’s ability to understand and interact with user interfaces. We run our experiments on the AndroidControl dataset (Li et al., 2024a), which consists of human demonstrations of controlling a device, used to train reward models that evaluate the effectiveness of actions in a UI automation task.

Visual Question Answering: We test a model’s ability to understand visual information, and answer questions about it using the VQAv2 dataset (Antol et al., 2015; Goyal et al., 2017a).

Detailed information about each dataset can be found in Appendix A.2.

### 4 Experimental Setup and Metrics

We run extensive experiments on six datasets, using models from two different families:

- • PaLM 2 (Anil et al., 2023): A text focused large model pretrained following the UL2 (Tay et al., 2022) paradigm. We experiment with three sizes for this model, referred to as XXS, XS, and S. We use a larger PaLM 2 L as a judge in our evaluations. PaLM 2 models are available via Google Cloud’s Vertex API by the names Gecko (XXS), Otter (XS), Bison (S), and Unicorn (L).
- • Gemini Pro (Team et al., 2023): A vision language model, also available via Google Cloud’s Vertex API.

We emphasize that our experimental setup is independent of the specific models used.

We describe the experiments for reward modeling and reinforcement learning in more details below.

#### 4.1 Reward Modeling

We train reward models with the loss described in Appendix A.1, and the hyperparameters described in Appendix A.3, varying the configurations of model size, and LoRA rank (which controls the number of trainable parameters).

We evaluate the performance of the preference based reward models using the pairwiseaccuracy, which measures the proportion of preferred responses ranked higher by the model among pairs of candidate responses. We evaluate the classification style reward models using the accuracy, which indicates whether the reward model score is close to the label of 0 or 1. We compare the High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) usage as estimated by Jax JIT at the time of training (Bradbury et al., 2018), and report its peak value. We also evaluate and report the speed of training for each setting.

#### 4.2 Reinforcement Learning

We train reinforcement learning policies using the “REINFORCE for Language Models" algorithm used by Lee et al. (2023a), using a

fixed reward model for each dataset for a fair comparison across the different settings (this is to reduce confounding factors that affect the policy performance). For every setting we try for policy model, both in size and LoRA rank, we replicate that for the value model as well. We report the experiment hyperparameters in Appendix A.3.

#### 4.3 Evaluations

We evaluate the performance of the RL tuned policies using the PaLM 2 L model (judge model), which is prompted to judge the responses produced by the policy.

We use it to evaluate the quality of the models as follows:

Text Summarization: We prompt the judge model to pick a preferred response among a pair of baseline, and policy responses. We report the “win rate” of the policy, as defined by the percentage of generated responses that are better than the baseline. We use an instructiontuned version of PaLM 2 S to generate baseline responses. We prompt the judge model twice, with two possible orders, to eliminate positional bias, and average the judgements: only if an output is preferred in both possible orderings is it considered a win. If it is only preferred in one ordering, then we label a tie.

Harmless Response Generation: We prompt the judge LLM to assess whether the generated response is harmless in a YES/NO manner. We report the “harmless rate”, which measures the fraction of the generated responses that are harmless.

Helpful Response Generation: Similarly to the text summarization task, we prompt the judge model to pick a preferred (more helpful) response among a pair of baseline and policy responses. We report the “win rate” of the policy, as defined by the percentage of generated responses that are better than the baseline.

Visual Question-Answering: We evaluate the quality of an RL policy as the difference between its accuracy, and that of a baseline Supervised Fine-Tuned Gemini policy.

UI Automation: We prompt the judge LLM with the task description, together with the action generated by the policy model. We

asked the judge LLM to determine whether the action is correct for the UI automation task. We calculate the accuracy rate as defined by the percentage of the policy model generated action that are considered as correct ones.

We compare and report the speed of each RL training experiment. In contrast to the speed measured for the reward models, which only include the learning step, the reinforcement learning measurements include episode sampling, reward model scoring, anchor logit calculation, and learning step.

### 5 Results and Takeaways

#### 5.1 Performance of PE-RLHF

We observe that PE-RLHF achieves results on par with those of standard RLHF in both reward modeling, and reinforcement learning.

PE-RLHF RMs match the performance of their RLHF counterparts across diverse tasks, as measured by the accuracy of the reward models on an evaluation split. These LoRA adapted RMs achieve this performance by training less than 0.1% of the large model’s total parameter count. We summarize the reward modeling results in the top half of Table 1.

When guided by the same reward model, PERLHF policies achieve performance competitive

with those of the policies trained in standard RLHF. They both perform significantly better than an SFT policy, as seen in Figure 3, showing the effectiveness of reinforcement learning. PE-RLHF policies achieve this performance by training less than 0.1% of the large model’s total parameter count for text based tasks, and less than 0.2% of the large model’s total parameter count for tasks involving both vision and text. We summarize the reinforcement learning policy results in the bottom half of Table 1.

We assess the quality of PaLM 2 L as a judge by collecting human feedback on 50 samples. We calculate the agreement between the human and judge model’s feedback across tasks, to verify the validity of the latter. We report details of our verification in Appendix A.4. 5.2 Effects of Model Size and LoRA

#### Rank

We conduct ablation studies across model size and LoRA rank to test their effect on the performance of the reward model and the reinforcement learning policy.

We observe that changing the LoRA rank does not significantly affect the performance of the reward models. However, PE-RLHF is more effective at modeling reward, and performs closer to standard full-tuning when the size

- Table 2: PE-RLHF RMs match the accuracy of full-tuned RMs, and get more effective at performing equally to fully-tuned RM as the backbone model increases in size. We don’t observe significant changes in performance with varying LoRA ranks.

of the model backbone increases. At the lowest model size, we see PE-RLHF falling marginally short of the fully-tuned reward models, whereas it matches the performance of fully-tuned ones for the largest model sizes.

In the reinforcement learning experiments, on the other hand, we observe that the PERLHF policies perform better (as evaluated by the judge LLM) as the LoRA rank increases. Bigger model backbones translate into better results for the PE-RLHF policies in comparison to the standard RLHF ones, consistent with the trend observed for the reward models. PERLHF falls marginally short of the fully-tuned RL policies with the smallest model size, but matches the performance of RL policies with the biggest size. See Tables 2 and 3 for detailed results.

- 5.3 Memory and Speed Advantages of PE-RLHF

Modern optimizers, such as Adam (Kingma and Ba, 2017) and Adafactor (Shazeer and Stern, 2018), require substantial memory to track var-

ious factors for each trainable parameter. By largely reducing the number of trainable parameters, PE-RLHF significantly lowers the memory footprint of both reward model training and reinforcement learning of policy. PERLHF RM training achieves the performance of a fully-tuned RM, while using only 43% to 74% of the peak HBM it needs for training. PE-RLHF reinforcement learning achieves the performance of standard RLHF, while using only 74% to 80% of the peak HBM.

The reduction in number of trainable parameters also translates into significant training speed-ups, as fewer parameters need updating at each training step. PE-RLHF RM trains at 1.15 × to 1.9× the training speed of standard RM. PE-RLHF RL trains 1.15× to 1.24× the speed of the RL loop in standard RLHF. We note that the LoRA reward models and policies converge in a similar number of steps as the fully tuned ones, so that the speed-ups in training steps translate into faster runs.

We observe that the memory savings, and training speed-up do not vary significantly with

We also note that the memory savings and speedup depend on multiple factors, such as sequence lengths of the examples, the accelerators being used, etc.

### 6 Related Work

#### 6.1 Pretrained Large Models (PLMs)

PLMs like LaMDA (Thoppilan et al., 2022), BLOOM (Workshop et al., 2022), PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022; Anil et al., 2023), and GPT-4 (OpenAI et al., 2023) have demonstrated remarkable performance across diverse tasks, including summarization (Stiennon et al., 2020), instruction following (Ouyang et al., 2022; Lai et al., 2023), and dialogue generation (Friedman et al., 2023; Jandaghi et al., 2023). Despite their success, limitations such as factual inaccuracies and imperfect instruc-

tion adherence remain (Radford et al., 2018; Ramachandran et al., 2016; Wei et al., 2021).

#### 6.2 Aligning PLMs with Human/AI Preferences

To address these limitations, aligning PLMs with human preferences has emerged as a crucial research area (Christiano et al., 2017; Leike et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2023; Ji et al., 2023). This typically involves collecting preference data on generated outputs, and fine-tuning the model with reward functions based on this data. However, overfitting the reward function can be problematic (Azar et al., 2023), requiring techniques like early stopping or parameter reduction to ensure optimal policy training. While most alignment research focuses on natural language tasks, recent efforts explore its application in other modalities like vision and audio (Lee et al., 2023b; Sun et al., 2023).

#### 6.3 Techniques for Alignment

Several techniques have been developed for aligning PLMs, such as Reward rAnked Fine-

Tuning (RAFT) (Dong et al., 2023), RRHF (Yuan et al., 2023), Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) (Christiano et al., 2017; Ouyang et al., 2022; Azar et al.,

- 2023), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) (Rafailov et al., 2023; Azar et al., 2023), Sequence Likelihood Calibration with Human Feedback (SLIC-HF) (Zhao et al., 2023), Pairwise Cringe Optimization (Xu et al., 2023), and Self-Rewarding Language Models (Yuan et al.,
- 2024). Among these, RLHF is particularly popular. This work explores combining RLHF with parameter-efficient methods to improve computational and memory efficiency.

- 6.4 Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), Representation Fine-Tuning (ReFT), and LoRA

Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, like LoRA (Hu et al., 2021) and DoRA (Liu et al., 2024), and Representation FineTuning (ReFT) ones (Wu et al., 2024b) reduce the number of trainable parameters in PLMs, while maintaining comparable performance to full fine-tuning. These methods are crucial for adapting PLMs to downstream tasks with limited data and computational resources. LoRA specifically factorizes weight updates into lowrank matrices, significantly reducing the number of parameters to be trained. To the best of our knowledge, there hasn’t been any work prior to ours extensively benchmarking parameter efficient approaches for RLHF.

6.5 Infrastructure and Implementation While the Transformer Reinforcement Learning (TRL) library (von Werra et al., 2020) offers similar functionalities, its multi-adapter RL feature remains experimental and lacks support for parallelization and vision modalities. This work is implemented using the PAX (Paxml, 2022) and SeqIO (Roberts et al., 2022) libraries, along with a custom-designed RL training loop infrastructure.

### 7 Conclusion and Future Work

This work demonstrates, through extensive experiments, that the Parameter-Efficient Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (PERLHF) setup that leverages LoRA achieves comparable performance to standard RLHF, while significantly reducing memory usage and

training time. Specifically, PE-RLHF reduces peak memory usage by approximately 50%, and induces a speed up of up to 90% in the reward model training. While the RL loop shows more modest gains of 27% peak memory reduction, and a 30% speed-up, these improvements still contribute to a more efficient training process.

While PE-RLHF demonstrates success in matching the performance of standard RLHF on in-domain test sets, further investigation is needed to explore its generalizability. Since parameter efficient fine-tuning methods can be prone to over-fitting and “reward-hacking", we propose three avenues for future work:

- • Broader Generalization: Ensemble models like Mixture-of-LoRA (Wu et al., 2024a) could enhance cross-domain generalization by introducing robustness during training. This approach holds promise for achieving broader applicability without significant computational overhead.
- • Mitigating Reward Hacking: Reward models are susceptible to “reward hacking", where the model exploits loopholes in the reward function instead of learning the desired behavior. Recent research (Ramé et al., 2024) suggests that weight-averaging models can mitigate this issue. Integrating such techniques with PE-RLHF’s efficient adapter-based approach could offer similar benefits at a lower computational cost.
- • Open Sourcing: We aim to share examples comparing PE-RLHF to standard RLHF using open-source models.

By addressing these avenues in future work, PE-RLHF has the potential to become a powerful and efficient tool for training large language and vision-language models with reinforcement learning, paving the way for broader and robust applications.

### Limitations

While the PE-RLHF setup demonstrates promising results in terms of efficiency and performance, there are certain limitations that warrant further investigation

• Potential Overfitting: As with any parameter-efficient fine-tuning method,

there is a risk of overfitting to the training data. We describe ideas in Section 7 to explore regularization techniques and other mitigation strategies for this potential issue.

- • Data Efficiency: Although PE-RLHF reduces the computational burden of RLHF, we are still not sure about the optimal data requirement of the RLHF process. Exploring data-efficient approaches for PERLHF is an important direction for future research.
- • Comparison with Other PEFT and ReFT Methods: We solely focus on LoRA as the parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT) method. While we expect other PEFT methods, like DoRA, and ReFT ones to behave similarly, our benchmarking work does not include these newer methods, and there is room to explore their behaviour in the RLHF setup, and whether their improvements over LoRA translate into better alignment with human preferences.

Despite these limitations, we believe that our work contributes to the development of more efficient and accessible alignment techniques for large language and vision-language models. Researching along the directions mentioned above will further strengthen the applicability and effectiveness of PE-RLHF across broader scenarios.

### Ethics Statement

While reducing alignment barriers for LLMs holds immense promise, it also presents ethical challenges by potentially facilitating malicious applications. The PE-RLHF method, while enabling efficient alignment, could be misused to train LLMs for generating harmful content like misinformation or hate speech at a reduced cost. Mitigating this risk necessitates careful governance of powerful LLMs, with controlled use to restrict "white-box" access to prevent malicious actors from manipulating the model’s inner workings, robust monitoring systems to detect and prevent the generation of harmful content, and the development and enforcement of ethical guidelines for LLM development and

deployment.

### A Appendix

#### A.1 RLHF Preliminaries

We review the RLHF pipeline introduced in Stiennon et al. (2020), which consists of 3 phases: supervised fine-tuning (SFT), reward model training, and reinforcement learning.

#### A.1.1 Supervised Fine-tuning

This is the most common type of tuning done to enable LLMs to cater to specific tasks, like summarization, dialogue generation, etc. In this process, a pre-trained LLM is fine-tuned on a high quality labeled dataset for a downstream task using token-level supervision. We refer to such a model as πAnchor.

#### A.1.2 Reward Model Training

To perform reinforcement learning, we need a reward score for each episode or response generation. We leverage a model-based solution for this.

A popular approach consists of deriving this reward from preference pairs. In this formulation, we learn a reward from preferences expressed over pairs of candidate responses. Given an input x, we sample a pair of responses (y1,y2) ∼ π from one or more models. We collect preference labels over the candidates from humans. We can also collect these labels by prompting an LLM model as shown by Lee et al. (2023a). These labels form a preference dataset of triplets D = {(x,yw,yl)}, where yw is the preferred response, and yl is the non-preferred one, given input x. A reward model (RM) rϕ is trained according to the Bradley-Terry-Luce Model (Bradley and Terry, 1952), which assumes that label yw is preferred over label yl

with probability r rϕ(x,yw)

ϕ(x,yw)+rϕ(x,yl), by minimizing the following loss:

Lr(ϕ) = −E

(x,yw,yl)∼D

log σ rϕ(x, yw) − rϕ(x, yl) ,

where σ is the sigmoid function.

Another popular way to train a reward model consists of learning a classifier to produce rewards between 0 and 1. Given a dataset D = {(x,y,p)}, where x is the input, y is the response, and p indicates whether the response is good (p = 1), or bad (p = 0), we train a reward model rϕ according a binary cross-entropy loss described below:

Lr(ϕ) = −E

p log σ rϕ(x, y) +

(x,y,p)∼D

(1 − p) log σ 1 − rϕ(x, y) ,

where σ is the sigmoid function.

#### A.1.3 Reinforcement Learning

We optimize a policy πθRL with reinforcement learning to maximize the cumulative reward

given by a reward model. The weights of the policy are initialized from those of the SFT model. A Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence term DKL is added to the objective to penalize πθRL for deviating too much from the initial anchor policy πAnchor. This term is controlled by a hyperparameter β (Fox et al., 2015; Geist et al., 2019). Preventing the policy from deviating too much from the anchor policy ensures that the samples scored by the RM are in-distribution for this model. This prevents πθRL from drifting into a region where it generates language that is highly rewarded by the RM, and yet is low-quality or gibberish, for example (a phenomenon known as “reward hacking” (Everitt and Hutter, 2016; Amodei et al., 2016)).

The optimization objective is described by the equation below:

J(θ) = E

(1 − β)rϕ(y|x)−

y∼πθ(·|x)

βDKL πθRL(y|x) || πAnchor(y|x) ,

(1)

where β is a hyperparameter in the range [0,1]. A.2 Dataset Details

#### A.2.1 Anthropic-HH Dataset

We use the Helpfulness and Harmlessness dataset introduced by Bai et al. (2022a) to train a reward model (Anthropic, 2022). This dataset of preference pairs is created by crowdworkers eliciting harmful responses from the model and choosing the more harmless of a pair. The model used to elicit responses from is a 52B context-distilled LM. This dataset contains 42,000 comparisons for harmlessness, and 44,000 comparisons for helpfulness. Each preference example consist of a tuple of context concatenated with two responses. We based our experiments on the harmlessness split, and have not experimented with the helpfulness one.

A.2.2 Stanford Human Preferences Dataset

The Stanford Human Preferences Dataset (SHP) (Ethayarajh et al., 2022) is derived from

Reddit questions/instructions, and top comments. It consists of 385,563 Reddit questions/instructions, and top-level comments for the corresponding posts. The data is split into a training set (90%), a validation set (5%), and a test set (5%). The posts are sampled from 18 domains, such as anthropology, legal advice etc. See Table 4 for the number of examples in each domain.

The SHP dataset, unlike the ELI5 one (Fan et al., 2019), makes use of timestamp information to infer that a comment is preferred to another one only if it has received more votes, and has not been visible for longer (to avoid the introduction of a bias favoring older posts).

The SHP dataset differs from the AnthropicHH dataset in that it focuses on helpfulness only (as opposed to both helpfulness and harmlessness for Anthropic-HH). The data in SHP is also human written, whereas Anthropic-HH is made of machine written responses.

- A.2.3 Reddit TL;DR Summarization We use OpenAI’s human preference dataset introduced in Stiennon et al. (2020) in the RL for summarization tasks. This dataset of preference pairs is created from the filtered Reddit TL;DR dataset constructed by Völske et al. (2017). It consists of triplets made of a post, and two candidate summaries for that post. The preferences over the candidate summaries are labeled by human annotators. The dataset contains a total of 92,000 pairwise comparisons.
- A.2.4 BOLT Message Summarization We use the BOLT English SMS/Chat dataset (Chen et al., 2018) for the task of RL for summarizing sequences of chat messages. Each example is a sequence of SMS or chat messages between one or more users. All examples are in English. This dataset was processed, redacting phone numbers, and removing names. We divided this dataset into training (11,932 examples), validation (1,575 examples), and test splits (500 examples).
- A.2.5 UI Automation We explore the AndroidControl (Li et al., 2024b) dataset for the UI Automation task, which consists of 13k traces for a total of 1.4k unique task instructions across 800+ apps. This dataset has a similar data format as the

UINav dataset (Li, 2021; Li et al., 2024c). Fig.

- 4 (reproduced from Li et al. (2024c)) shows an example trajectory of the send_email task from the UINav dataset, where green and blue boxes indicate detected UI elements of text boxes and icons. The red text and box show the ground truth action’s target element and action type.

- A.2.6 VQA v2 We use the VQA v2 image question answering dataset introduced in Goyal et al. (2017b). This dataset consists of images, questions about the image, and human answers each together with a confidence level expressed as “yes”, “maybe”, or “no”.

A.3 Experiment Hyperparameters We describe the experiment hyperparameters for each of the datasets.

- A.3.1 Anthropic Harmless Dialogue We train all the harmlessness reward models using a batch size of 128, for 5,000 steps, and pick the checkpoint with the highest validation pairwise accuracy. We consider learning rates from [1e-5, 5e-5, 1e-4, 2e-4, 5e-4]. We find the best learning rate in the full-tuning setups to be 1e-5, and the best learning rate in the LoRA setups 2e-4.

- A.3.2 Stanford Human Preferences We performed hyperparameter sweeps over different learning rates (2e-5, 5e-5, 1e-4, and 2e-4), dropout probabilities (0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2), and LoRA ranks (1, 4, 8, 16) to report the best metrics for each configuration of the reward model training.

Table 5 lists the best set of hyperparameters for each configuration.

- A.3.3 Reddit TL; DR Summarization We train all the Reddit TL;DR reward models using a batch size of 128, for 5,000 steps. We pick the checkpoint with the highest validation pairwise accuracy. We consider learning rates from [1e-5, 5e-5, 1e-4, 2e-4, 5e-4]. We find the best learning rate in full-tuning setups to be 1e-

- 5, and the best learning rate in LoRA training setups 1e-4.

We conduct the RL training using the “REINFORCE for Language Models” algorithm used by Lee et al. (2023a). We sample 128 episodes

per batch using the policy with temperature of 0.7 for decoding. We use β = 0.05 for KL regularization. We set the learning rate to 1e-5 for the reinforcement learning of the policy model. We picked this learning rate after trying 1e-4, 5e-4, 1e-5, 5e-5, and 1e-6.

#### A.3.4 BOLT Message Summarization

We conduct RL training using the reward model trained on the Reddit TL;DR dataset, as described in Appendix A.3.3. We use the “REINFORCE for Language Models” algorithm used by Lee et al. (2023a). We sample 128 episodes

per batch using the policy with temperature of 0.7 for decoding. We use β = 0.05 for KL regularization. We set the learning rate to 1e4 for the reinforcement learning of the policy model.

- A.3.5 UI Automation We carry out a hyperparameter sweep on the learning rate and dropout probability to find the optimal setup. We choose 4 different learning rates and dropout probabilities, and implement the sweep on the Cartesian product of these parameters. We sweep over the following values:

- • Learning rate in {2e-5, 5e-5, 1e-4, 2e-4}, and dropout in {0, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1} for LoRA
- • Learning rate in {5e-6, 1e-5, 2e-5, 5e-5}, and dropout in {0, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1} for full tuning

We list the optimal hyperparameters in Table 6.

- A.3.6 VQA v2 We train all reward models using a batch size of 128. We use a learning rate of 1e-5 for fulltuning, and 1e-4 for LoRA tuning.

In supervised fine-tuning, we train the model with a batch size of 64, and a learning rate of 1e-7 after trying 1e-3, 1e-4, 1e-5, 1e-6, and 1e-8.

We conduct RL on the fine-tuned checkpoint. We sample 32 episodes using the policy with temperature of 0.9 for decoding. We used a learning rate of 1e-8 for reinforcement learning of the policy model after trying 1e-7 (learning rate used in SFT).

A.4 AI as a Judge

In this section, we describe how we validate the LLM L model as a judge. We prompt it to rate 50 validation input-output pairs. For text summarization, the possible AI judgements are ‘response 1 better’, ‘response 2 better’ or ‘tie’. For harmless response generation, the possible outputs are ’YES’ or ’NO’. We report all judging prompts we used below. We then collect human labels for the sample input-output pairs. We calculate the agreement between human labels and LLM L labels. We determine the labels agree if and only if the human label matches the AI one. We report the alignment rate between AI and humans in Table 7

Task Agreement rate Summarization 77.2% Harmless Response Generation 90.7%

##### Table 7: Accuracy values for variants of RMs trained on AI labels.

Summarization A good summary is a shorter piece of text that has the essence of the original. It tries to accomplish the same purpose and conveys the key information from the original post. Below we define four evaluation axes for summary quality: coherence, accuracy, coverage, and overall quality.

Coherence: This axis answers the question “how coherent is the summary on its own?” A summary is coherent if it’s easy to understand when read on its own and free of English errors. A summary is not coherent if it’s difficult to understand what the summary is trying to say. Generally, it’s more important that the summary is understandable than it being free of grammar errors.

Accuracy: This axis answers the question “does the factual information in the summary accurately match the post?” A summary is accurate if it doesn’t say things that aren’t in the article, it doesn’t mix up people, and generally is not misleading.

Coverage: This axis answers the question “how well does the summary cover the important information in the post?” A summary has good coverage if it mentions the main information from the post that’s important to understand the situation described in the post. A summary has poor coverage if someone reading only the summary would be missing several important pieces of information about the situation in the post. A summary with good coverage should also match the purpose of the original post (e.g. to ask for advice).

Overall quality: This axis answers the question “how good is the summary overall at representing the post?” This can encompass all of the above axes of quality, as well as others you feel are important. If it’s hard to find ways to make the summary better, the overall quality is good. If there are lots of different ways the summary can be made better, the overall quality is bad.

Given a piece of TEXT with SUBREDDIT and TITLE and two of its possible summaries, output 1 or 2 to indicate which summary best adheres to coherence, accuracy, coverage, and overall quality.
