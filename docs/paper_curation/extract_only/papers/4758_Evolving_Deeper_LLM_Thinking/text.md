We explore an evolutionary search strategy for scaling inference time compute in Large Language Models. The proposed approach, Mind Evolution, uses a language model to generate, recombine and refine candidate responses. The proposed approach avoids the need to formalize the underlying inference problem whenever a solution evaluator is available. Controlling for inference cost, we find that Mind Evolution significantly outperforms other inference strategies such as Best-of-N and Sequential Revision in natural language planning tasks. In the TravelPlanner and Natural Plan benchmarks, Mind Evolution solves more than 98% of the problem instances using Gemini 1.5 Pro without the use of a formal solver.

### 1. Introduction

How can a large language model (LLM) be guided to think deeper about a complex problem and leverage inference time compute to improve its problem solving ability? Prior research has investigated various strategies for leveraging inference time compute, such as chain-of-thought [41, 21], self-consistency [39], sequential revision based on feedback [36, 30, 8, 19, 1], and search guided by auxiliary verifiers or evaluators [43]. When a solution evaluator is available, search strategies have an advantage of being able to reliably improve problem solving ability with increased compute. For example, methods such as Bestof-N [4, 24, 25] and tree search [37] naturally exploit additional compute to explore a larger set of solution candidates, thereby increasing the probability of finding a successful solution.

To better exploit inference time compute, we propose an evolutionary search strategy for LLMs that combines free-flowing stochastic exploration with large-scale iterative refinement. We refer to this approach as Mind Evolution. As illustrated in Figure 1, Mind Evolution is a genetic search strategy that evolves a diverse population of candidate solutions, leveraging an LLM to generate, recombine and refine solution candidates based on feedback from an evaluator. The overall process is analogous to combining divergent thinking (free-flowing parallel idea exploration) with convergent thinking (idea evaluation and selection), considered as hallmarks of intelligent problem solving behavior [14].

Unlike Best-of-N, which searches broadly by generating independent candidates for evaluation, Mind Evolution searches both broadly and deeply, exploring a diverse set of candidates and refining the most promising alternatives. Unlike sequential reasoning approaches,

such as self-refinement or tree search [37, 25], which require evaluation of individual reasoning steps, Mind Evolution performs global refinement of complete solutions, and therefore only requires a global solution evaluator rather than a stepwise process reward. Also, typical of evolutionary methods, Mind Evolution can be easily parallelized.

There has been prior work on combining evolutionary search with LLMs, primarily in the literature on evolutionary program generation [34, 17, 29, 23, 6]. However, this prior work focuses on searching through formal program spaces, using guidance from execution feedback or code explanation. By contrast, Mind Evolution is not restricted to searching in a formal space. This allows Mind Evolution to be applied to problems that are not formalized, or remain difficult to formalize, as long as a programmatic solution evaluator is available. In particular, we focus on natural language planning tasks where candidate solutions can still be automatically parsed, evaluated and critiqued using an implementable oracle evaluator. This approach exploits the observation that it is often easier to evaluate the quality of a candidate solution than it is to generate good solutions for a given problem [11].

In the domain of natural language planning, we consider the TravelPlanner [42] and Natural Plan [47] benchmarks, where constraint satisfaction problems are expressed in natural language without any explicit formalization of the underlying objectives, constraints or variables. These problems require a set of interconnected decisions that satisfy a set of global and local constraints. For example, in TravelPlanner, a travel plan should be produced that respects various accommodation and dinning constraints, while also considering budget limitations and other preferences, all expressed solely in natural language. To date, LLMs have yet to achieve good performance on these tasks

Figure 1 | Mind Evolution is a genetic-based evolutionary search strategy that operates in natural language space. The figure illustrates how Mind Evolution evolves a population of solution candidates toward higher quality candidates for a travel planning task. The candidate population is improved through an iterative process, where an LLM is used to recombine and refine candidates in each iteration.

without the aid of formal solvers [16]. For example, Gemini 1.5 Flash and o1-preview only achieve a success rate of 5.6% and 11.7% on TravelPlanner respectively, while for the Meeting Planning domain in Natural Plan, they respectively only achieve 20.8% and 44.2%. Even exploiting Best-of-N over 800 independently generated responses, Gemini 1.5 Flash still only achieves 55.6% success on TravelPlanner and 69.4% on Meeting Planning. In this paper, we show that exploration and refinement with evolutionary search can notably improve problem solving ability. In particular, when controlling for inference time compute, Mind Evolution allows Gemini 1.5 Flash to achieve a 95.6% success rate on TravelPlanner and 85.0% on Meeting Planning. We further experiment with a two-stage approach, where any unsolved problem instances are subsequently tackled by Mind Evolution with Gemini 1.5 Pro, which leads to 100% success on TravelPlanner and 98.4% on Meeting Planning. All of the experiments in this paper only use off-the-shelf LLMs without any finetuning.

To our knowledge, the only prior work that achieves comparable performance on the TravelPlanner benchmark is [16], which leverages an auxiliary formal solver and requires the LLM to first translate a given problem instance into an equivalent formalization. In general, it takes significant effort and expertise to correctly formalize a problem expressed in natural language; prompting an LLM to correctly perform such a translation requires at least as much domain expertise. Mind Evolution removes this constraint by directly optimizing solutions in the space of natural language.

Finally, we introduce a new benchmark problem, StegPoet, that involves encoding a hidden message in a generated essay, story or poem. This form of stenography [33] is difficult to formalize and solve, yet a hidden message detector can still be implemented to programmatically guide the search. Our motivation is to demonstrate the applicability of search beyond natural language domains that can be easily formalized. We find that Mind Evolution allows Gemini 1.5 Pro to achieve a success rate of 87% in this task.

### 2. Related Work

Pairing LLMs with Evolutionary Search In addition to the program generation studies discussed in Section 1, several recent works have explored combining LLMs and evolution for numerical optimization [26, 3] and combinatorial optimization [28, 44]. The problem spaces we tackle in this work, such as natural language planning, can also be viewed as combinatorial optimization problems – optimizing plans subject to constraints specified in natural language. In contrast to these previous studies, we focus on evolving solutions in natural language spaces instead of formal spaces. This removes the requirement of task formalization, which requires significant effort and expert knowledge for each task instance.

Other works have also applied evolutionary search to prompt optimization, with the goal of improving performance on target tasks [45, 10, 15]. Among these, EvoAgent [45] also evaluated their approach on the TravelPlanner benchmark. In contrast to our work, which performs evolutionary search directly on

plans, EvoAgent evolves new LLM agents to form a multi-agent system for problem solving. Their best success rate on the TravelPlanner validation set was 7.2% with GPT-4, while our approach achieved over 95% with Gemini 1.5 Flash.

Pairing LLMs with Evaluators In this work, we evaluate solutions with program-based evaluators during the evolutionary search. The idea of integrating execution-based evaluators in the inference loop has been widely adopted in the literature of code generation, where the execution environment provides feedback for the LLM to fix bugs in the generated code [7, 22, 27, 46, 8, 17, 29, 23, 6, 36].

Other prior work has also considered using learned verifiers, reward models, or self-evaluation for response refinement [20, 30], search [37, 4, 9, 43, 35], and improving model learning [40, 25, 32, 1]. These approaches can often be applied to wider domains and free-form solutions, but learned feedback models or self-evaluators can be noisy and are not perfectly reliable. We leave consideration of such approximate feedback mechanisms for future work.

### 3. Method

Mind Evolution employs a genetic search strategy, combined with an LLM and a tailored set of prompts, to orchestrate an efficient search for solutions to natural language planning tasks. Before describing Mind Evolution in detail, we first provide a brief overview of language-based genetic algorithms.

#### 3.1. Language-based Genetic Algorithm Overview

Genetic algorithms [18, 12, 31] are a meta-heuristic inspired by natural selection. In a genetic algorithm, a population of candidate solutions is evolved toward populations that contain a greater proportion of higher quality individuals with respect to a target optimization objective. Such an objective is also often referred to as the “fitness” function. Each individual candidate has a genetic representation that can be mutated and recombined with others.

Evolutionary search usually begins with a population of independently generated candidate solutions. In each generation, the fitness of every individual is evaluated with respect to the target objective. Candidates are then stochastically selected for reproduction based on their fitness (“selection”). In reproduction, the genetic representations of selected parents are combined (“crossover”) and potentially altered (“mutation”) to produce new child solutions. Such a process creates the next generation of children, which

then enter the population. Population fitness generally increases over successive generations, as parents with greater fitness are more likely to be selected for recombination.

Island Model To sustain diversity in an evolving population it is also helpful to introduce an island model [38, 5], where distinct sub-populations (“islands”) are created and evolved independently between “migration” and “island reset” events that occur at specified frequencies. For a migration operation, the solutions on one island are stochastically chosen based on fitness to migrate to an adjacent island. For an Island Reset operation, the populations on islands with low overall fitness are replaced by strong solutions from the global population, which also has a selection effect. The island model has been adopted in recent successful efforts, such as FunSearch [34].

Language-based Genetic Representation The individual candidates in a language-based genetic algorithm are represented by natural language. This allows the strong language understanding and generation capabilities of an LLM to be leveraged to implement powerful recombination (crossover and mutation) and island reset operations through prompting.

#### 3.2. Mind Evolution

Figure 1 illustrates the design of Mind Evolution, with its hyperparameters listed in Table 1. The core components of Mind Evolution are:

- 1. the specific choices for the selection and migration operations;
- 2. the set of prompts that implement the initialization, recombination (crossover and mutation), and island reset operations with an LLM;
- 3. the fitness function that evaluates the quality of a given solution and optionally provides feedback on issues detected.

The overall evolution process is repeated until a valid solution is found, or until 𝑁gens generations have been completed, after which the best scoring candidate is returned.

Fitness Evaluation As discussed in Section 1, we implement a fitness function for each problem domain, where candidate solutions are parsed and evaluated programmatically. In principle, any function that can evaluate solution quality can be used, including LLM evaluation. The evaluation function plays three key

roles in Mind Evolution: (1) scoring solutions by measuring the optimization objective, if any; (2) verifying whether the solution satisfies given constraints; and (3) providing corresponding textual feedback. For example, the evaluation function for the Meeting Planning task scores a proposed plan and provides textual feedback based on how many constraints are violated (e.g. meetings conflict with existing schedules), how many valid meeting events are included in the schedule, and whether the plan follows the required format (see Appendix A.2 for more details). We have found that using textual feedback is important empirically, as shown in our ablation study in Section 4.4.

Note that for many classical search problems (e.g., NP-complete problems), verifying solutions can be much easier than solving the problem [11]. Similarly, we observe that it is possible to write an evaluation function for the natural language planning tasks we consider. The ability to check the correctness of a candidate solution does not obviously lead to the ability to generate a valid solution in the tasks we consider. That is, implementing an evaluation function is not equivalent to solving the task.

Population Initialization Given a target problem, we independently sample 𝑁convs initial solutions by prompting an LLM with a description of the problem, any information needed for solving the problem, and relevant instructions. If 𝑁seq > 1, each of these initial solutions is then evaluated and refined sequentially through 𝑁seq − 1 additional turns of the “Refinement through Critical Conversation” process explained below. In total, this initialization procedure generates 𝑁convs × 𝑁seq candidate solutions, which forms the initial population on the first island for the first generation.

Figure 2 | Illustrating the Refinement through Critical Conversation (RCC) process, where an initial solution is first proposed, then evaluated and subjected to feedback from a critic, after which an author proposed a refined solution and the process iterates.

Refinement through Critical Conversation (RCC) Given a candidate solution (or a set of candidate solutions for the process of recombination) we leverage an LLM to generate an improved solution by organizing a critical conversation between a “critic” character and an “author” character, as illustrated in Figure 2. Separating these two roles is intended to improve the critical thinking ability of an LLM. Each conversational turn is structured as a prompt-driven process, where solutions are refined based on critical feedback, similar to Reflexion [36]. In particular, the critic first analyzes the candidate solution(s) provided as input, interprets the textual evaluation feedback, and suggest ways to correct any issues presented in the feedback. The author then proposes a single refined solution based on the input candidate(s), the subsequent evaluation(s), and the critic’s analyses. The specific prompts used to drive these conversations are given in Appendix A.1. An ablation study in Section 4.4 shows that the critic’s analysis step provides substantial performance improvements.

Selection To produce the next generation of an island, we follow Boltzmann tournament selection [13] where 0 to 𝑁parent parents are stochastically sampled from the population according a probability distribution that is derived from a softmax transformation of their fitness scores. In this way, higher-performing solutions are more likely to be selected for reproduction, while other candidates can still be occasionally selected for diversity.

Crossover and Mutation We implement the crossover and mutation operations as a single recombination step, where an LLM is instructed to improve a given set of parents using the RCC process described above (Figure 2). In particular, for recombination we sample 1 to 𝑁parent parents and alter Step (b) in Figure 2 to first incorporate the evaluation results of the parents, then apply the critic to all parents and propose the revised solution as an “initial solution” for the next generation. Then, if 𝑁seq > 1, we continue to follow Steps (c)(d)(e) to sequentially generate 𝑁seq − 1 child solutions by refining each previous child using the RCC process.

For each generation on each island, 𝑁convs × 𝑁seq child solutions are added to the island population, with duplicate solutions removed. For selection, we follow a Boltzmann tournament instead of explicitly retiring candidate solutions, except when performing an Island Reset below.

Migration between Islands Between migration events, each island population is evolved independently. During a migration, the top 𝑁emigrate solutions are cloned from the current Island 𝑖 to the next Island 𝑖 + 1 after completing the generation on the current island (we update the populations on the islands sequentially from 1 to 𝑁island). Migration is performed cyclically between the islands, so emigrants from Island 𝑁island arrive at Island 1. We have found that this form of cyclic migration accelerates the overall evolution process.

Island Reset Island reset happens every 𝑁reset interval generations. During an Island Reset event, the top performers are first selected from the global population, the populations on 𝑁reset islands with the lowest average scores are retired, and the selected top performers are cloned onto the reset islands. To select top performers, we explore two approaches: (1) directly select the top 𝑁top candidates according to fitness; and (2) first select the top 𝑁candidate candidates according to fitness, then prompt the LLM to select 𝑁top good candidates from this pool that are substantially different from each other. The ablation study in Section 4.4

show that the latter strategy, using an LLM for Island Reset, achieves better performance.

### 4. Experiments

Tasks We evaluate Mind Evolution on three benchmark natural language planning domains: two tasks from Natural Plan [47], including Trip Planning (Section 4.2) and Meeting Planning (Section 4.3), and the TravelPlanner [42] benchmark (Section 4.1). (We omit the Calendar Scheduling task from Natural Plan, since these problems can be solved by enumeration.) Implementation details for each task is provided in Appendix A, including the prompts (Appendix A.1) and evaluation functions used (Appendix A.2).

Models We use Gemini 1.5 Flash (gemini-1.5-flash001) as the default LLM in our experiments below. The hyperparameters used when applying Mind Evolution to Flash are specified in Table 1. In addition to evaluating Mind Evolution with the Flash model, we also investigate a two-stage approach, where Gemini 1.5 Pro model (gemini-1.5-pro-exp-0827) is used to tackle problems that are not solved within the 𝑁gens generation limit. Such a two-stage approach provides better cost-efficiency than using the Pro model on every problem instance. When applying Mind Evolution to the Pro model we alter the hyperparameters from those specified in Table 1 to: 𝑁convs = 8, 𝑁seq = 3, 𝑁parent = 10, 𝑃𝑟no parents = 1/5.

Baselines For each task, we compare Mind Evolution to three baseline search strategies that use the same solution evaluator and task-specific prompts:

- 1. 1-Pass, where a solution is proposed using a single forward pass of the LLM.
- 2. Best-of-N [4], where up to 800 candidate solutions are independently generated until a successful solution is found (the same upper bound as Mind Evolution).
- 3. Sequential-Revision+, where 10 candidate solutions are proposed independently, then revised separately for 80 turns using the RCC process (Figure 2). Note that 10 independent threads of 80-turn refinements are used instead of a single 800-turn refinement, because we rarely observe improvements after 80 turns. This baseline is similar to running 10 trials of multi-turn Reflexion [36].

Additionally, for reference, we also include an additional 1-Pass baseline that uses OpenAI o1-preview.

Metrics We measure Success Rate as the percentage of problem instances that are solved completely within a benchmark domain, separating the validation and test sets. (Note that the Success rate is referred to as Solve Rate in Natural Plan [47] and Final Pass Rate in TravelPlanner [42].)

To assess the cost of inference compute we report the number of LLM calls, the number of input and output tokens, and the total API cost of calling the LLM. (These costs are given in US Dollars, using prices from October 2024 when the experiments were conducted. The base rates are listed in Appendix D.) Note that assessing computational cost is particularly important when evaluating search strategies like Mind Evolution, since search is more expensive than generating a single solution. These statistics can help researchers and developers understand the cost-benefit trade-offs when using search to enhance LLM problem solving ability.

#### 4.1. TravelPlanner

TravelPlanner [42] is a natural language planning benchmark that simulates the problem of organizing a trip plan for a user who expresses preferences and constraints. We focus on the sole-planning mode (see [42] for details), where each problem instance consists of a list of options regarding accommodation, restaurants, attractions and transportation, plus additional constraints that specify user preferences for budget, cuisine, etc. A plan is evaluated based on whether it satisfies the user preferences and commonsense constraints.

Table 2 gives detailed results that compare the overall Success Rate and computational cost of Mind Evolution versus the baseline strategies. In terms of Success Rate, Mind Evolution clearly outperforms the baseline strategies, achieving over 95%. By comparison, Sequential-Revision+ provides a reasonable baseline, achieving almost 83%, while Best-of-N struggles, achieving only 55.6%. Overall, these results demonstrate a clear advantage of an evolutionary strategy that combines a broad search, through stochastic exploration, with a deep search that leverages an LLM for solution refinement.

Considering the two-stage approach, where Mind Evolution uses Gemini 1.5 Pro for any unsolved problems, we find that nearly the entire dataset can be solved, achieving a 100% success rate on validation and 99.9% on test problems respectively. The only work we are aware of that comes close to this success rate is [16], which uses GPT-4 for auto-formalization then leverages a formal solver to achieve 98.9% and 97.0% on validation and test respectively.

lution achieves comparable results without requiring a formal solver.

Finally, we note that the TravelPlanner dataset is organized into three levels of difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard) and three trip durations (3 days, 5 days, 7 days), rendering 9 different problem classes. Figure 3 presents a breakdown of the success rates achieved across these different categories, showing that the success rates of 1-Pass and Best-of-N decline when planning for more travel days, but the trend is less clear for Mind Evolution and Sequential-Revision+, both of which iteratively refine proposed solutions.

#### 4.2. Natural Plan – Trip Planning

The Trip Planning task [47] involves finding an itinerary that consists of a sequence of cities to visit and number of days in each that satisfies flight connectivity and scheduling constraints – see Table 3 for a problem instance. We split the benchmark into 320 validation and 1,280 test instances (described in more detail in Appendix B).

The results in Table 2 again show that Mind Evolution strongly outperforms the baselines on this task, achieving 96.2% on the validation and 94.1% on the test instances. Table 2 also shows a qualitative comparison between the results produced by Mind Evolution and the baseline strategies. Note that Best-of-N performs better in this scenario (77.2%), even beating Sequential-Revision+ (74.4%). We find that for the two-stage approach, Mind Evolution achieves 100% on the validation set and 99.6% on the test set. These findings again highlight the benefit of evolutionary search versus simple sampling and sequential refinement.

Finally, we note that the difficulty of this task varies with the number of cities to visit, ranging from 3 to 10. Figure 4 shows a breakdown of the Success Rate in terms of number of cities, where the relative advantage of Mind Evolution appears to increase as the number of cities grows.

#### 4.3. Natural Plan – Meeting Planning

For the Meeting Planning task a sequence of meetings should be scheduled to maximize the number of meetings between individuals subject to availability, location and travel time constraints [47]. This task differs from TravelPlanner and Trip Planning in that not every meeting can be scheduled for every problem instance, implying that it is not possible to know whether an optimal solution has been reached.

fore, to obtain the results shown in Table 2, we allow the searches to proceed until the upper bounds on iteration counts have been reached. For this task, we split the set of instances into 500 validation and 500 test instances (see Appendix B for details).

The results shown in Table 2 continue to demonstrate a significant performance for Mind Evolution over baseline strategies, achieving an 85.0% Success Rate on the validation set and 83.8% on the test set. Notably, the two-stage approach using Gemini 1.5 Pro achieves success rates to 98.4% and 98.2% on validation and test respectively.

Finally, Figure 5 shows the breakdown of success rates by the number of people to schedule meetings with. In this case, we find that Mind Evolution sustains a significant advantage in success rate as the number of people increases.

The Sequential-Revision+ plan omits the annual show in Madrid and plans a non-existent flight, but is correct in the number of days. In contrast, the Mind Evolution plan satisfies all specified requirements.

#### 4.4. Analysis and Ablation Studies

To understand how Mind Evolution’s performance scales, and how the different components affect its behavior, we provide additional measurements and ablations to gain additional insight.

Scaling Regarding scaling, Figure 6 reports the Success Rate achieved by Mind Evolution across the planning tasks as a function of the number of generations. These results clearly show steady improvement for Mind Evolution as the number of generations is increased.

To compare the scaling of Mind Evolution to that of the baseline search methods, we also plot the Success

Rate and average task evaluation scores as a function of the number of candidate solutions generated by the each strategy (Figures 7–9). The task evaluation scores are calculated by penalizing unsatisfied constraints and suboptimality of the objective value, hence the maximum score that can be achieved in any problem instance is zero (see Appendix A.2 for details). In Appendix D, we provide another perspective on the cost-benefit trade-offs in terms of the specific API costs incurred.

Figures 7–9 show the results for the TravelPlanner, Trip Planning and Meeting Planning tasks respectively. In each case, we see that the overall success rates and average task evaluation scores improve monotonically with an increasing number of proposed solutions across all search methods. These plots also show that Mind Evolution is consistently more effective than the baseline strategies with respect to the number of candidate solutions needed to achieve a specified level of success rate (or average task performance).

We note that Best-of-N appears to be significantly underperforming on TravelPlanner. We hypothesize that this occurs because this task involves implicit commonsense constraints (e.g., a trip plan should return to the origin city, a restaurant cannot be visited twice, etc.), which are not given in the problem instance but instead learned from evaluation feedback, which Best-of-N does not leverage.

Ablations We also conducted a set of ablations to study the contribution of the different components of Mind Evolution. Table 4 shows that using the critic step in the RCC process (Figure 2 in Section 3.2) and textual feedback from the evaluation functions are the most critical to performance, although the other components also make meaningful contributions to performance.

To assess hyperparameter sensitivity, we investigated the Trip Planning task in greater detail, choosing the harder setting with 10 cities to better reveal differences in performance. (Similar results are also

problem is difficult to formalize, it remains amenable to programmatic verification, which makes it addressable by the methods considered in this paper. In this task, a hidden message (𝑀) expressed by a sequence of numbers should be encoded in a piece of creative text about a particular topic, expressed in the form of an essay, story or poem. The goal is to both provide a number-to-word substitution cipher and a generated text that uses the cipher to encode the message. Figure 10 gives an example. We impose an additional constraint that there must be, on average, 𝐵 words between successive cipher words in the generated text, which ensures that simply listing the cipher words as the text portion does not qualify as solution when 𝐵 > 0.

improves the performance of Mind Evolution. The bottom three rows compare the effect of increasing the number of candidate solutions per generation versus having more generations while controlling for a similar number of candidates considered overall. In this case, it appears that deeper evolutionary search indeed has benefits, although it is also important to continue exploring broadly in each generation.

The difficulty of this problem varies along four axes:

- 1. Difficulty increases with the length of the hidden message, 𝑀. We set 10 ≤ |𝑀| ≤ 30.
- 2. The repetition of the numbers in 𝑀. The more repetition, the more stringent the constraints.
- 3. The “closeness” of the repeated numbers to each other. Each form of writing dictates how much repetition of the same word and proximity of occurrence is acceptable. The LLM must balance adherence to the form with the need to correctly encode the message.
- 4. Empirically, as 𝐵 (the mean distance between cipher words) grows, the problem becomes more difficult.

### 5. A Challenging New Task: StegPoet

We introduce a challenging new task, StegPoet, where a hidden message should be stenographically encoded [33] into a piece of creative writing. Even though the

In our tests, 3 ≤ 𝐵 ≤ 7.

We divide the problem instances into a validation split of 101 instances and a test split of 245 instances. See Appendix F for additional details about the StegPoet evaluation.

Detailed performance results for Mind Evolution and the baseline strategies are given in Table 6, while

- Figure 11 shows performance per difficulty level. Here the two-stage Mind Evolution (+pro) achieves 87.1% on validation and 79.2% on test. Best-of-N only manages to solve 1% of the validation tasks.

### 6. Conclusion

We have presented Mind Evolution, an evolutionary search approach for solving challenging natural language planning problems, by scaling inference-time compute for stochastic exploration and iterative refinement. An evaluation on the TravelPlanner and Natural Plan natural language planning benchmarks, as well as a new benchmark StegPoet introduced in this paper, demonstrates that Mind Evolution significantly outperforms Best-of-N and sequential revision. To our knowledge, this is the first approach that is able to achieve such a level of success on these tasks without explicitly leveraging a formal solver.

Limitations The main limitation of the current work is the focus on natural language planning problems where proposed solutions can be programmatically evaluated and critiqued. In future work, we aim to extend beyond this limitation by developing LLM-based evaluators that would enable broader applications.

### A. Implementation Details

Here we describe the implementation details of Mind Evolution. The code will be made available.

#### A.1. Prompt Design

We first use Meeting Planning as an example to illustrate the structure of the prompts used. The prompts, as well as the model responses when parent solutions are given, are shown in Figures 12-16. The prompts begin with general instructions and a general problem definition, few-shot examples, then a task description. The few-shot examples help the LLM understand the problem and generate solutions closer to the desired formats. For TravelPlanner, we take two 3-day example plans from the training set and use them across all tasks (3-7 days). For Trip Planning, we take two example plans from the few-shot examples provided by the benchmark and use them across all tasks. For Meeting Planning, we use the 5-shot examples provided by the benchmark for each task.

After the task description, we include parent solutions with corresponding evaluation feedback, followed by critical thinking instructions (in Figures 14– 15). These instructions lead the LLM to improve the parent solutions, following the Refinement through Critical Conversation (RCC) process described in Section 3.2. The critical thinking instructions include problem-specific Strategy/Question prompts based on findings in each validation set (ablated in Section 4.4). In the model responses, one can see that the LLM follows the critical thinking instructions in playing the critic role to analyze the parent solutions, and playing the author role to propose a new solution.

We also give an example of the prompt and a model response for TravelPlanner, which has the same structure, in Figures 17–22.

#### A.2. Evaluation Functions

In this work, solutions are evaluated programmatically with a function. As described in Section 3.2, an evaluation function has three main roles: (1) scoring solutions by measuring the optimization objective, if any; (2) verifying whether the solution satisfies given constraints; and (3) providing corresponding textual feedback. Specifically, we score natural language plans by penalizing the constraints that are not satisfied, the objectives that are not maximized, and for not following the required solution format. Thus the maximum score for all tasks is zero. We also provide textual feedback that describes how the constraints are not satisfied and how the objectives are not maximized.

TravelPlanner Our evaluation function for TravelPlanner is modified from the TravelPlanner evaluation code [42]. The evaluation code expects travel plans in JSON format. We modify the original evaluation code to make it output a cumulative score that reflects all the constraints that are not satisfied, instead of simply answering whether or not a plan satisfies all the constraints. We also make it provide textual feedback for the violated constraints.

In the TravelPlanner validation set, the constraints are provided in both user query text and a structured JSON format. However, in the test set, the constraints are only described in user query text. To make it easier for the evaluation function to consider the constraints, we extract them from user query into JSON using Gemini 1.5 Flash. For example, to extract the requested cuisines, we prompt Gemini with “Look at the following text and tell me if there are any cuisine requirements on the upcoming trip...” multiple times, and formulate the final answer via majority voting. To verify the reliability of this approach, we tested on the validation set and found complete agreement between the JSON extracted from user query and the provided JSON. In addition, we upload our test solutions to the TravelPlanner evaluation server, and found that the results agree with the official evaluation.

Trip Planning Similar to TravelPlanner, the Trip Planning evaluation function expects plans in JSON format. Since Trip Planning user queries are programmatically generated, we can parse the constraints specified in user queries. These constraints include number of days to stay in a city, specific days to be in a city (e.g., for events), and whether there are flights between cities. Our evaluation function scores a plan by the constraints that are not satisfied and whether it conforms with the desired JSON format, while also providing corresponding textual feedback.

Meeting Planning The Meeting Planning evaluation function also expects plans in JSON. Constraints are also provided in structured JSON format. Unlike TravelPlanner and Trip Planning, Meeting Planning has an optimization objective – the number of friends to meet with. We modify the original evaluation evaluation function to score a proposed plan by how many people that are not going to be met with; whether it conflicts with the schedules of other people; whether it includes meetings with the same person more than once; whether any part of the plan conflict with other parts; whether it follows the desired format as instructed. In Figures 23–24 we present the evaluation function that implements the simple logic described above as an example.

### B. Data Splits

TravelPlanner TravelPlanner has 45 training tasks, 180 validation tasks, and 1,000 test tasks in the original benchmark.

Natural Plan – Trip Planning The Trip Planning benchmakr has 1,600 example tasks. There are eight different difficulty levels, ranging from 3 to 10 cities. Each difficulty level has 200 examples. We split the dataset into validation and test sets by putting the first 40 examples from each difficulty level into validation, and the last 160 examples into test, giving 320 examples in validation (which we used for prompt development) and 1,280 for test. In Figure 4, we show the performance at each difficulty level.

Natural Plan – Meeting Planning The Meeting Planning benchmark has 1,000 example tasks. There are ten different difficulty levels, ranging from meeting one to ten different friends. Each difficulty level has 100 examples. We split the dataset into validation and test sets by putting the first 50 examples from each difficulty level into validation, and the last 50 examples into test, giving 500 examples in validation (which we used for prompt development) and 500 for test. In Figure 5, we show the performance at difficulty level.

In addition to Table 3, we present qualitative examples of TravelPlanner and Meeting Planning in Table 9 and Table 10, respectively.

### C. GPT Results

Table 7 presents the results of Mind Evolution using GPT-4o-mini with the same sets of prompts. Specifically, with 1-pass inference, GPT-4o-mini also struggles at planning tasks, achieving 0% on TravelPlanner, 9.1% success rate on Trip Planning, and 20.2% success rate on Meeting Planning. Again, Mind Evolution significantly improves the performance by over 100% relatively across different benchmarks.

### F. Additional Details for StegPoet

The prompt design used for StegPoet is given in Figure 26.

StegPoet Evaluation Each proposed solution should contain a cipher and text component. The first step is to calculate what is encoded in the text by finding all the cipher strings; this is done via simple capitalization-agnostic character-matches. We refer to the actual encoded string as 𝑀′. If 𝑀 = 𝑀′ the problem is solved correctly. The numeric evaluation of a proposed solution is computed as follows:

- 3. If a word appears an incorrect number of times (too few or too many) in the text, it is indicated, along with the error.
- 4. An annotated copy of the text is returned. The annotations indicate where the cipher-keywords were found (they are shown asterisked), and the first error is indicated.
- 5. If the text encodes the cipher correctly, but also encodes extra words, that is indicated.
- 6. If everything in 𝑀′ is correct, but |𝑀′| < |𝑀|, it is indicated as such.

For this task, we experimented with many different genre forms (poetry, short-story fiction, essay, monologue, etc.), as well as inspirations from contemporary to classic writers.

- 1. Invalid if the text or cipher component cannot be parsed or violates constraints.

- (a) Words in the cipher cannot be subsets of each other (e.g., origin and original).
- (b) Words in the cipher cannot be repeated.
- (c) Words in the cipher should be at least 4 characters long.
- (d) Words in the cipher should contain only alphabetic characters.

- 2. What is the first position, 𝑖, in which 𝑀𝑖 ≠ 𝑀′

𝑖? This is the integer part of the score.

- 3. Compute the Levenshtein distance between 𝑀 and 𝑀′. Levenshtein distance is often used in information theory and linguistics to measure the difference between two sequences [2]. This is scaled between (0,1) and added to the integer component above.

Additionally, textual feedback, without numeric penalties, is also provided in the revision request made to the LLM.

- 1. A clearly marked list of what 𝑀′ was found.
- 2. A list of number mappings missing from the cipher, or unnecessary numbers specified in the cipher.

For this task, you are the world’s best poet, linguist and hidden code creator! You strive to write in the style of shel silverstein. I would like you to come up with a 1:1 mapping from numbers to words for the list of numbers demarcated by <HIDDEN-MESSAGE START> and <HIDDEN-MESSAGE END>. Then, cleverly hide the numbers in an poem about the fun of walking.

SPECIFICS:

- * You can choose the words.
- * A number cannot have more than one word assigned to it.
- * A word cannot be used twice in the mapping.
- * Create a substitution-ENCODING-CIPHER for each number and then put those words into the poem in the order that they appear in the hidden message.
- * If you use a word in the ENCODING-CIPHER in the poem, then it can only be used to encode a number. Nowhere else. Otherwise it will be mistaken as part of the message.
- * The numbers must be encoded in the order that they appear in the hidden message.

<HIDDEN-MESSAGE START> 90 70 50 40 40 10 50 80 70 900 50 30 <HIDDEN-MESSAGE END>

Here are some guidelines to follow.

- * The poem must NOT contain any numbers.
- * Numbers should not be encoded with a word or words that directly represent the number. For example, DO NOT represent "2" : "Dual". Similarly, "4" : "four" is not acceptable.
- * In general, numbers should not be represented by words that are numeric in nature.
- * Numbers should not be represented by hyphenated words or using any other non alphabetic character. They should be encoded with single words.
- * The words used for ciphers should not be subsets of each other.
- * Your poem should make sense, be understandable, and be in the style of shel silverstein.
- * Your poem should not just be a list of words that look like jibberish. Try to have at least 4 words between your cipher words. Absolutely crucial:
- * Important -- make sure that each number in the hidden message is represented in the poem.
- * DO NOT SKIP ANY numbers. The numbers must be encoded in the SAME order as they are given to you.
- * PRECISION IS OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE.
- * Note that we did not use common words such as ’and’ and ’the’ etc. to encode the numbers, as such words may be difficult to use only at the specific times required to encode the hidden-message.
- * You should not use common words to encode the numbers in the cipher.
- * The words you use in the cipher should be at least 4 characters long.
- * Though you may have to use the same word multiple times, try to avoid using the same sentence or phrase multiple times. Please begin and end your poem with <POEM START> and <POEM END>. FORMATTING INSTRUCTIONS:
- * Please begin your answer by providing the mapping from the numbers in the hidden message to the words you select.
- * I’ve included 3 examples of successful ENCODING-CIPHERs below.
- * VERY, VERY IMPORTANT: You should come up with your own creative ENCODING-CIPHERs!
- * Note the semicolon that is required after each cipher entry in the ENCODING-CIPHER section. This must be present! EXAMPLE #1:

Can you please hide the message demarcated by <HIDDEN-MESSAGE START> and <HIDDEN-MESSAGE END> into a poem about computers.

<HIDDEN-MESSAGE START> 77 22 33 40 44 77 50 66 55 5 40 40 3 70 8 <HIDDEN-MESSAGE END>

<ENCODING-CIPHER START> "22" : "computers"; "33" : "become"; "44" : "vital"; "55" : "them"; "66" : "need"; "77" : "everyday"; "40" : "more"; "50" : "need"; "70" : "certain"; "3" : "grow"; "5" : "exist"; "8" : "future"; <ENCODING-CIPHER END>

<POEM START> Everyday, computers become more vital to our lives. Everyday, we need them to exist more and more. That will grow, for certain, in the future. <POEM END>
