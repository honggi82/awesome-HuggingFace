### Abstract

Recent advancements in LLM pretraining have featured ever-expanding context windows to process longer sequences. However, our controlled study reveals that models pretrained with shorter context windows consistently outperform their long-context counterparts under a fixed token budget. This finding motivates us to explore an optimal context window scheduling strategy to better balance long-context capability with pretraining efficiency. To this end, we propose SkyLadder, a simple yet effective approach that implements a short-to-long context window transition. SkyLadder preserves strong standard benchmark performance, while matching or exceeding baseline results on long-context tasks. Through extensive experiments, we pretrain 1B-parameter models (up to 32K context) and 3B-parameter models (8K context) on 100B tokens, demonstrating that SkyLadder yields consistent gains of up to 3.7% on common benchmarks, while achieving up to 22% faster training speeds compared to baselines2.

### 1 Introduction

The evolution of language models has been marked by a consistent expansion in context window sizes (Figure 1 left). While early models like GPT [39] and BERT [8] were limited to context windows of 512 tokens, subsequent models have pushed significantly beyond these bounds. GPT-2 [40] doubled this capacity to 1024 tokens, and with Large Language Models (LLMs) exceeding 1B parameters, this trend has continued: Llama [51] has a 2048-token window, followed by Llama-2 [52] (4096 tokens), and Llama-3 [13] (8192 tokens). The need for models to handle longer sequences during inference has fueled the rush to expand the context window. As models pretrained with longer context windows reduce document truncation and preserve coherence [9], there is a widespread belief that such models should perform comparably to, or even surpass, their shorter-context counterparts.

We question the common belief that larger context windows do actually improve performance. Close inspection of previous work reveals that there has yet to be a fair experimental setup for comparing models across different context windows while adhering to a fixed token budget. Using tightly controlled experiments, we test how changing only the context window size during pretraining impacts their performance. As shown in Figure 1 (right), our results indicate that models pretrained using shorter contexts always outperform long-context models, when assessed by their average performance across popular benchmarks. In addition, we verify that the performance gap is not eliminated by using advanced document packing strategies [13, 9, 44].

To ensure the model can ultimately process long sequences, the model still needs to be exposed to long sequences. However, given the finding that shorter context windows enhance performance on

downstream tasks, we face a trade-off between long-context capability and pretraining effectiveness. We propose SkyLadder, a simple yet effective context window scheduling strategy designed to balance both objectives. SkyLadder does this by progressively expanding the size of the context window during pretraining, beginning pretraining with a minimal short context window (e.g., 8 tokens) and progressively expanding it to the long target context window (e.g., 32,768 tokens).

Empirical results on 1B-parameter models (up to 32K context window) and 3B-parameter models (up to 8K context window) on 100B tokens demonstrate that SkyLadder outperforms naive longcontext pretraining baselines, in both short- and long-context evaluation tasks. For example, models trained with SkyLadder demonstrate significantly higher accuracy on standard benchmarks (e.g., HellaSwag), and reading comprehension tasks (e.g., HotpotQA), while still maintaining competitive performance on long-context evaluations like RULER. We further investigate the mechanisms behind the superior performance by observing the training dynamics, and discover that SkyLadder exhibits more concentrated and effective attention patterns.

Overall, we suggest that the length of the context window is an important dimension in pretraining and should be scheduled over the course of training. We recommend a progressive approach that begins with a small context of 8 tokens and gradually increases according to a linear function of training steps. Given a target context window (e.g., 32K), we suggest that allocating approximately 60% of the total training tokens to this expansion phase leads to stronger downstream performance compared to baselines. This scheduling strategy optimally enhances both training efficiency and model capability, offering a practical recipe for improving pretraining in language models.

[21] focused on training acceleration in 400M models. We extend these findings by demonstrating, for the first time, that context window scheduling significantly boosts both efficiency and performance at much larger scales (up to 3B parameters). A parallel approach from Pouransari et al. [38] segments training documents by length, but Fu et al. [10] caution that such segmentation can introduce domain biases, as longer texts often cluster in specific domains such as books. Recent developments in continual pretraining with long context windows [37, 55, 12], can also be viewed through the lens of context window scheduling with different strategies (illustrated in Figure 2). Our work represents the first demonstration of both effectiveness and efficiency of context window scheduling, providing empirical evidence of its benefits in both standard and long-context benchmarks.

- Figure 3: An illustration of the workflow for pretraining data preparation highlights several critical decisions. Key considerations include the method of data packing, the type of attention mask to employ (causal or intra-doc mask), and determining the appropriate context window length L.

approaches follow a continual pretraining paradigm [10, 57], which extends a pretrained backbone model to longer contexts through specialized fine-tuning or additional training. Several works propose to intervene in the positional embeddings to accommodate longer sequences [1, 31, 37, 4, 22], while others perform extended pretraining on longer-sequence corpora [12, 55, 32, 63]. Our approach differs from previous methods as we train native long-context models from scratch, rather than modifying a pretrained model in post-training. Compared with a naive long-context pretraining baseline with a constant schedule, our approach delivers substantial gains on multiple long-context tasks, underscoring the benefits of training from scratch. These findings show that our method can be a promising direction for future research on building language models with longer context windows.

### 3 How Context Window Affects Pretraining

How does context window affect pretraining? To investigate this in a fair and comparable manner, we pretrain language models from scratch with context windows ranging from 512 to 16,384 tokens under a fixed total number of tokens, evaluating via perplexity and downstream task benchmarks. We examine how the context window size impacts model performance, analyzing how data packing and masking strategies interact with window size.

#### 3.1 Packing, Masking and Context Window

Most modern LLMs are based on a decoder-only transformer architecture [54] with a fixed context window size denoted by L. In contrast, the pretraining corpus, D = {d1,d2,d3,...,dn}, consists of documents with varying lengths different from L. Therefore, a key step before pretraining is to pack the documents into sequences of length L. Formally, a packed sequence Ci is constructed as Ci = Trunc(di,1) ⊕ di,2 ⊕ ··· ⊕ di,n−1 ⊕ Trunc(di,n) , where ⊕ represents concatenation, and Trunc(·) denotes truncation of documents to ensure len(Ci) = L. Following previous works [44, 64], document boundaries within Ci are explicitly marked using end-of-sequence ([EOS]) tokens.

After the sequences are packed, the inputs are passed into transformer layers for next-token prediction training. A crucial component of these layers is the attention mechanism, which can be formulated as Ai,j = qi⊤kj, and then Attn(X) = Softmax(A + M). In decoder-only models, a mask M is applied to introduce constraints. A common approach is to use a causal mask, which ensures that each position can only attend to previous tokens by masking out (setting to −∞) attention scores corresponding to future positions: Mij = −∞ for j > i and Mij = 0 otherwise. A recently proposed masking scheme, known as intra-doc mask [64, 13], imposes a constraint that only allows tokens to attend to each other if they belong to the same document. Let each document d have start index sd and end index ed, the masking can be denoted as Mijintra = 0 when ∃d such that sd ≤ i,j ≤ ed and j ≤ i, and Mijintra = −∞ otherwise. The model is trained with the standard cross-entropy loss on the packed sequences of length L. The workflow for pretraining data processing is illustrated in Figure 3.

#### 3.2 Preliminary Study on Context Window Size

As per Section 1, we initiate our study by investigating the impact of context window size on model performance through a controlled experiment. Specifically, we pretrain language models with varying context window sizes, while preserving all other experimental settings. This enables a pure analysis of the context window’s influence on model performance. Through this analysis, we aim to understand whether longer context windows inherently lead to better or worse model performance.

(d) Distribution of context window sizes for IntraDoc and Random methods.

- Figure 4: Ablation studies of different factors on different context window sizes. Note that the validation PPL is obtained on the validation documents with a sliding window size of 512 tokens. The packing strategy in (a) is Random, and the model sizes in (b) and (c) are 1B and 120M, respectively. Note that the context window in (d) means the number of available preceding tokens when making next-token prediction (calculation details in Section A.6).

Key Variables. The context window size determines the number of tokens included in the context for each packed sequence. However, as discussed earlier, several additional factors influence the content within the context window: (1) Packing methods determine which documents constitute the context window, and different packing strategies can significantly alter the composition of token sequences; (2) Masking methods decide whether cross-document attention is enabled within the same context window. The choice of masking affects how the information from different documents interacts during training.

Packing and Masking. To study the impact of packing, we employ two strategies: random packing and semantic packing. For random packing, documents are randomly concatenated without a specific ordering. For semantic packing, inspired by Shi et al. [44], we retrieve and concatenate semantically relevant documents from the corpus, aiming to keep them within the same context window. After experimenting with both a dense retriever [20] and a lexical retriever BM25, we found that BM25 gives stronger performance and chose it as our focus. For masking, the baseline approach is causal masking, where each token can attend to all preceding tokens within the same context window, regardless of document boundaries. Conversely, recent studies [64, 9] show that disabling crossdocument attention, thereby enabling intra-document attention, improves performance. For clarity in subsequent discussions, we denote random packing with causal masking as Random, BM25 packing with causal masking as BM25, and random packing with intra-document masking as IntraDoc.

Training. We pretrain models from scratch using the TinyLlama codebase [61], and study models with 120M, 360M and 1B parameters. Given the substantial computational cost associated with retrieval in semantic packing, we randomly select around 30B tokens from the CommonCrawl (CC) subset of the SlimPajama dataset [46] as the pretraining corpus. All models undergo training for up to 100B tokens (∼3.3 epochs). To ensure consistency across experiments, we strictly control all other settings, retaining the same batch size and learning rate schedule for all context windows. All models also incorporate Rotary Positional Encoding (RoPE) [47] to encode positional information. Appendix A.3 and A.4 give further model architecture details and training settings.

Evaluation. For all model sizes, we use perplexity (PPL) on validation documents from the original dataset as a key metric, in line with established practices [10, 24, 17]. Note that when comparing models across different context windows (e.g., a 2K-context model and an 8K-context model), we must ensure the evaluation sequence fits within the shorter model’s context window to maintain a fair comparison. We also evaluate 1B models on downstream standard benchmarks: HellaSwag [60], ARC-Easy and ARC-Challenge [6], Winogrande [42], CommonsenseQA [48], OpenBookQA [34], PIQA [2], Social-QA [43], and MMLU [16]. We employ the OLMES suite [15] for the evaluation, as it has been shown to provide reliable and stable results with curated 5-shot demonstrations [12].

#### 3.3 Experimental Results

Figure 1 presents the main experimental result, obtained using the Random setting with 1B-parameter models. The results indicate that context window size significantly influences the performance of LLMs, with shorter contexts generally leading to better performance. To further investigate the

factors contributing to the observation, we perform a comprehensive analysis to examine potential variables that may affect the conclusion. Figure 4 shows our results, and we derive four key findings:

Findings: (1) The advantage of training on shorter contexts is consistent across model sizes; (2) This advantage is independent of the packing and masking methods employed; (3) It is also unrelated to the use of positional encoding; (4) The best packing and masking strategy is IntraDoc, which outperforms others probably because it introduces a larger number of short contexts during pretraining.

Findings (1) and (2). As shown in Figure 4, regardless of the model size in (a) or the packing and masking methods in (b), a shorter context window for pretraining generally results in higher average performance on benchmarks. The finding on benchmarks is consistent with the trend of validation PPL, where shorter context windows always yield lower PPL.

- Finding (3). When using shorter context windows, one might hypothesize that the model learns positional encoding patterns for nearer positions more frequently, leading to better performance on standard benchmarks. To test the hypothesis, we systematically ablate RoPE by completely excluding it during pretraining, following prior work [25]. In Figure 4(c), models trained with short-context windows still outperform their long-context counterparts, even in the absence of positional encoding. This suggests that the advantages of shorter contexts are independent of positional encoding.
- Finding (4). From Figure 4(b), we observe that IntraDoc achieves the best validation PPL across all context window sizes compared to Random and BM25, alongside consistently higher performance on standard benchmarks (c.f. Appendix A.7.1). This raises the question: why does IntraDoc excel? We attribute the advantage to the context window size distribution of IntraDoc, which implicitly increases the prevalence of shorter contexts. As illustrated in Figure 4(d), despite the sequence length of 8K, fewer than 1% of context windows actually reach this limit. While prior work links the success of IntraDoc to reduced contextual noise [64], we identify a complementary factor — reduced average context window size — as a key factor in its strong performance. That is, we hypothesize that the effectiveness of IntraDoc may also be closely tied to short context windows.

#### 4.1 Method SequenceLength:L

Sequence Length: L

Inspired by learning rate scheduling, we explore whether dynamically scheduling the context window from short to long during pretraining could lead to performance improvements. This method can be implemented by applying multiple local “mini” causal masks to a long, packed sequence. We illustrate this masking strategy in Figure 5.

Figure 5: An illustration of SkyLadder with Random and IntraDoc. The example shows a packed sequence (length L) consisting of two documents. For SkyLadder, the context window w starts from a small value and dynamically adjusts during training, eventually converging to the masking patterns of Random or IntraDoc.

Formally, we define a local window length w. The associated mask Mw is defined as follows: Mij = 0 when ⌊wi ⌋w ≤ j ≤ i, and Mij = −∞ otherwise, where ⌊wi ⌋w calculates the largest multiple of w that is less than or equal to i, effectively defining a block-wise attention mask for the query token at position i. We linearly adjust the window size upwards by a constant factor per training step t: w(t) = min(we,ws + ⌊αt⌋), where we and ws represent the ending and starting context window sizes, respectively. Here, α denotes the rate of expansion, and t corresponds to the training step. As the training progresses, when the dynamic context window size w(t) eventually reaches the desired (long) context window size L = we, it remains fixed at that value. At this point, the attention mask is equivalent to a full causal mask. Notably, this method modifies

the effective context window through masking, independent of how the sequences are packed. As such, this mask Mw can be integrated with MIntra, which maintains the attention boundaries between documents; it can be seamlessly combined with most packing and masking strategies.

#### 4.2 Experimental Setup

We follow the same setup in Section 3.2 to pretrain language models with 8K context on 100B tokens. We set ws = 32 and α = 1/8 by default, which means that a model roughly needs 64K steps (around 64B tokens) to reach the final desired context window of L = 8192. All baseline and SkyLadder models are implemented with Flash Attention 2 [7] (pseudocode in A.5). We fix all other hyperparameters, such as the learning rate schedule, batch size, etc., for fair comparison. Due to resource constraints, we do not perform extensive hyperparameter search to obtain the best combinations for w(t), α, and ws. In our ablation study, we show that these hyperparameters have a negligible impact on performance, as long as they are within a reasonable range.

For evaluation, we use the same suite mentioned in Section 3.2 with standard benchmarks. To evaluate the performance of long-context question answering within an 8K length, we utilize the 30-document setting from the Multi-Document QA (MDQA) benchmark [30]. This is a widely-adopted benchmark that is shown to be reliable for models of 1B scale [38, 64], with an average length of approximately 6K tokens. We also select synthetic tasks within RULER [18], as defined by Yen et al. [59]. We choose the setup of the task that fills up the model’s target context window L.

#### 4.3 Experimental Results

Tables 1 and 2 present the main results, highlighting significant improvements achieved by SkyLadder across standard benchmarks, reading comprehension tasks and long-context benchmarks. For instance, compared to the Random baseline, integrating SkyLadder yields notable performance gains on standard tasks such as MMLU (+2.5%), ARC-E (+7.4%), and HellaSwag (+4%). This suggests that models with SkyLadder excel at learning common knowledge during pretraining. Additionally, our method further improves the performance of the strong baseline IntraDoc across many benchmarks. Meanwhile, for realistic long-context benchmarks like MDQA, SkyLadder matches or exceeds baseline performance. For RULER, the performance difference is likely because of fluctuation caused by its synthetic nature and small size [55]. More long-context evaluation can be found in Section A.7.3, confirming that SkyLadder is comparable with or better than baselines on longcontext evaluation. In addition to Random and IntraDoc, we also verify that SkyLadder improves the performance of the BM25 model on both short and long tasks (Section A.7.4).

To address potential concerns that the benefits observed in short contexts may stem from the high level of noise in CC, we conduct additional experiments using the FineWeb-Pro dataset [65], a carefully curated high-quality dataset containing 100B tokens. As shown in Table 4, improved data quality indeed leads to substantial performance gains. However, our key findings remain consistent: IntraDoc

continues to outperform Random, and SkyLadder consistently delivers significant improvements over both baselines. This demonstrates that our method generalizes to corpora of varying quality.

We further examine whether SkyLadder is generalizable beyond natural language tasks. Following Ding et al. [9], we pretrain 1B code models on 100B Python code with the Starcoder tokenizer [29]. We observe a lower training loss (∼ 0.9) for code pretraining compared to natural language (∼ 2.1), suggesting that the structure in code makes the training easier. However, as shown in Table 3, there is still significant improvement when applying SkyLadder under both greedy decoding and sampling setups, especially when the target context length is 32K. This demonstrates the potential of SkyLadder to coding and possibly other reasoning tasks beyond natural language modelling.

#### 4.4 Scalability Experiments

We examine whether SkyLadder’s improvements persist as we scale up the model parameters and extend the context window size. We use the largest model and context size that our compute permits.

Model Size. We conduct experiments across three model sizes: 120M, 360M, and 3B parameters on the Fineweb-Pro dataset. Table 5 demonstrates that models utilizing SkyLadder consistently achieve better standard benchmark performance on all model sizes. For long context tasks, our method does not benefit 120M models, possibly due to their limited capacity in processing long sequences. However, the performance gain on 3B models is prominent. We observe a positive scaling trend: as the model size grows, the performance improvement also increases, indicating the potential of applying our method to even larger models beyond our current scale. We leave it as a future work to explore larger models as it requires significantly more compute.

Context Window Size. To examine whether SkyLadder can effectively scale to longer context windows, we train 1B models with a 32K context window on 100B FineWebPro tokens. We adjust α to 1/2 to ensure that the final context window expands to 32K before the end of pretraining. As shown in Table 6, our model demonstrates strong performance on both standard and long benchmarks. In addition, the performance difference of SkyLadder (0.9%) between the 8K and 32K models is largely reduced compared with the baseline approach (1.8%), which alleviates

the performance degradation described in our earlier study. Notably, compared to the baseline Random approach, SkyLadder trains the model on progressively shorter contexts during earlier stages. This reveals a counterintuitive insight: naively training a model with a long context window is not always optimal, even if the model is evaluated on long contexts. In contrast, strategic scheduling of the context window during pretraining can yield better results.

#### 4.5 Ablation Study

We now examine the impact of hyperparameters in SkyLadder scheduling. To manage computational costs, we adopt a default setup of pretraining 120M models with 8K context on 100B CC tokens.

Expansion Rate. We investigate the impact of the expansion rate α in Figure 6 (left). We choose different α ranging from slowest (1/12) to fastest (1). Our findings reveal that, for short contexts, performance generally improves as the expansion rate slows down. However, selecting an excessively slow rate (e.g., 1/12) can negatively affect long-context performance due to insufficient training on longer contexts. Therefore, we recommend setting α to 1/8 for a good balance.

Initial Context Window. As the final context window length we is fixed to L, the sole remaining hyperparameter is ws. Intuitively, setting ws to an excessively large value (e.g. close to L) leaves little room for scheduling, resulting in sub-optimal performance. In Figure 6 (right), we demonstrate that when ws is set to a relatively small value (e.g., 8), great performance can be achieved for both short and long contexts. This suggests that there is still potential for further improvement in our default setup. Therefore, we recommend starting with a small context window, such as 8 tokens.

Scheduling Type. The default scheduling method in SkyLadder is linear scheduling. We evaluate different context window scheduling types (more details in Table 20 and Figure 12 in Appendix A.7.4): (1) Stepwise Linear rounds window size w(t) to multiples of 1K, resulting in a step function; (2) Sinusoidal increases quickly at the early stage then slows down; (3) Exponential starts slow but accelerates sharply; (4) Continual pretraining setup trains with 4K context windows for ∼97B tokens, then switches to 32K context for the final 3B tokens. Table 7 shows that linear and sinusoidal schedules outperform the exponential variant on long tasks, likely because the exponential schedule, with extended short-context pretraining at the beginning, fails to adequately train on long contexts. Last, the most commonly used continual pretraining setup performs poorly overall, suggesting abrupt context changes harm both short and long performance. These findings suggest that context window scheduling is superior to both constant long-context pretraining and continual pretraining.

Overall, we conclude that the schedule should start from a small ws and the expansion should be gradual. We leave it to future work to study more advanced schedules and discover optimal configurations. For instance, it is possible that the schedule needs to be adjusted for various model sizes. More ablations for combination with BM25, hybrid attention, cyclic schedules and scheduling under a compute budget can be found in Appendix A.7.4.

#### 4.6 Analysis and Discussion

Training Efficiency. We observe a significant boost in training efficiency when employing SkyLadder in Table 8. On 8K models, SkyLadder accelerates training time by 13% due to the reduced context window in calculating attention. With a 32K context window, the efficiency gain becomes even more pronounced: our method saves 22% of training time while achieving better performance. The FLOPs saving is larger than the actual time because of reduced attention calculation.

Attention Pattern. We next investigate why SkyLadder, despite being trained on short contexts overall, consistently outperforms the baseline. As language models rely on attention mechanisms to encode context information, we study how attention patterns change. Specifically, during pretraining, we monitor the dynamics of (i) attention entropy (solid lines in Figure 7), where a lower entropy is associated with better downstream performance [62]; (ii) attention sink [56], where the initial token in the context receives disproportionately high attention. We utilize the metric in Gu et al. [14] to quantitatively measure the amplitude of attention sink. As shown in Figure 7 (dashed lines), compared with the baseline Random, SkyLadder demonstrates reduced attention entropy, suggesting a more concentrated attention pattern. However, a slower emergence and lower amplitude of attention sink are simultaneously observed. This suggests that SkyLadder’s attention is concentrated on the key information in the context instead of the initial token, which accounts for the performance gain.

Training Stability. To further understand the reasons behind SkyLadder’s better performance, we analyze the impact of pretraining context length on training dynamics. We pretrain 120M-parameter models with different context lengths. We first monitor the maximum attention logits (Smax = maxi,j qi · kj for all i,j) throughout pretraining, following the methodology of K2 [50]. A large attention logit indicates that an attention head is malfunctioning and may cause numerical instability. In Figure 8, we observe that pretraining with a long context of 16K tokens leads to exploding max attention logits, while a shorter window leads to lower attention logits.

Next, we study the loss and gradient behavior by computing four stability metrics over the first N = 30K steps of pretraining, where Lt denotes the training loss and Gt is the gradient norm before clipping:

• Average Gradient Norm: N1 Nt=1 min(Gt,1), where larger values indicate more aggressive gradient updates.

In Table 9, longer-context models show higher volatility, less smooth loss curves, more frequent upward spikes, and larger gradient norms, all indicating less stable optimization. In contrast, shortcontext models converge more smoothly with smaller fluctuations and more controlled gradient updates. Together, these results reveal that short-context pretraining is inherently more stable, both in attention behavior and optimization dynamics. The reduced numerical instability and smoother convergence likely enable more consistent gradient signals and better overall convergence, explaining their superior downstream performance.

Comparison with Related Work. We compare our method with another approach for improving pretraining in Table 10. As discussed in Section 2, Pouransari et al. [38] proposed Dataset Decomposition (DD) by segmenting a document into sequences of varying lengths and using a curriculum during pretraining. However, this approach inevitably introduces domain bias, as the document lengths in different domains are different [10]. This explains why DD with only one short-to-long cycle fails to outperform the IntraDoc baseline. To mitigate this, the authors suggested iterating through multiple cycles of long and short data, which does improve performance substantially. In contrast, our method achieves better performance by avoiding such biases by not altering the data order based on length. In Appendix A.7.4, we experimented with various cyclic schedules but did not observe any improvements. In fact, we noticed loss spikes between cycles (Figure 14), indicating potential issues with domain shifts. This further supports that our method is safer since it does not disrupt the natural ordering and distribution of the data. More discussion with other related works [28, 21] is in Section A.8, where we demonstrate that our work provides novel insights that scheduling the context window over the entire training time improves both efficiency and performance.

### 5 Conclusion

We conduct a comprehensive controlled study of the impact of context window on pretraining, revealing that a shorter context window is more beneficial to the model’s performance on standard benchmarks. This debunks the trend of pretraining with longer context windows. We therefore propose SkyLadder to schedule the context window from short to long during pretraining, which gives substantial improvement in downstream performance and computational efficiency. We conclude that context window scheduling is an important dimension for pretraining, and deserves more consideration. In the future, we plan to explore more dynamic and performant scheduling strategies that adapt according to model size or pretraining data distribution.

### NeurIPS Paper Checklist

#### 1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper’s contributions and scope?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Our abstract summarizes the findings of our preliminary study and the essence of the SkyLadder method: we systematically study the impact of context length on pretraining and empirically verify the effectiveness of our approach.

Guidelines:

- • The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper.
- • The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
- • The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
- • It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper.

##### 2. Limitations Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We discuss limitations of our study in Section A.1. Guidelines:

- • The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
- • The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
- • The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be.
- • The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
- • The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon.
- • The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size.
- • If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness.
- • While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.

#### 3. Theory assumptions and proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof?

Answer: [NA] Justification: This paper is not a theory paper and we do not include theoretical results. Guidelines:

- • The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
- • All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and crossreferenced.
- • All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
- • The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide intuition.
- • Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
- • Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.

#### 4. Experimental result reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We provide detailed hyperparameter setting (Section 3.2, A.4), implementation pseudocode (A.5) and model configuration (A.3). We implement most of the experiments in TinyLlama, a popular public project for pretraining, which makes it highly reproducible.

Guidelines:

- • The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
- • If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not.
- • If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
- • Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.
- • While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example

- (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm.
- (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.
- (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
- (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

#### 5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Our pretraining code is based on TinyLlama, an open-source pretraining framework. The data is based on open-source pretraining corpora like SlimPajama and Fineweb-Pro. We include the code in the supplementary materials, and will open source the code upon acceptance.

Guidelines:

- • The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
- • Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/ public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
- • While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark).
- • The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https: //nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
- • The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
- • The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
- • At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if applicable).
- • Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.

#### 6. Experimental setting/details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results?

Answer: [Yes] Justification: We describe the training and testing setup in detail in Section 3.2 for our preliminary study, and in Section A.7.3 for SkyLadder experiments. Guidelines:

- • The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
- • The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
- • The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.

#### 7. Experiment statistical significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We conduct McNemar test for our main results in Table 1. The details for testing are in A.7.3. Due to the excessive cost of pretraining, we do not perform repeated runs of the same setup. However, our claims are supported by multiple variations of the pretraining and comprehensive ablation studies in the main text and appendix.

Guidelines:

- • The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.

- • The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper.
- • The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions).
- • The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
- • The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
- • It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean.
- • It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified.
- • For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates).
- • If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

#### 8. Experiments compute resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments?

Answer: [Yes] Justification: We share the compute information in Section A.9. Guidelines:

- • The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
- • The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
- • The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
- • The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn’t make it into the paper).

#### 9. Code of ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?

Answer: [Yes] Justification: We fully anonymize the paper and the code. All experiments fully conform with the Code of Ethics. Guidelines:

- • The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
- • If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation from the Code of Ethics.
- • The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

#### 10. Broader impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed?

Answer: [Yes] Justification: We discuss the broader impact of our work in Section A.2.

Guidelines:

- • The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
- • If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
- • Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
- • The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.
- • The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
- • If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

#### 11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [NA] Justification: This work is not meant to release a pretrained language model or publish a dataset. Guidelines:

- • The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
- • Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters.
- • Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
- • We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.

#### 12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We explicitly mention and cite the source of the datasets (SlimPajama, FineWeb-Pro) and the implementation codebase in our paper (TinyLlama). License information is described in Section A.11. All of them are open-source projects available for public use.

Guidelines:

- • The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
- • The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.

- • The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL.
- • The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
- • For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of that source should be provided.
- • If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset.
- • For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
- • If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the asset’s creators.

#### 13. New assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided alongside the assets?

Answer: [Yes] Justification: We provide instructions to reproduce our experiments with the code in the supplementary materials. Guidelines:

- • The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
- • Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations, etc.
- • The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is used.
- • At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.

#### 14. Crowdsourcing and research with human subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)?

Answer: [NA] Justification: This project does not involve human subjects or crowdsourcing. Guidelines:

- • The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
- • Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main paper.
- • According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector.

#### 15. Institutional review board (IRB) approvals or equivalent for research with human subjects

Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained?

Answer: [NA] Justification: This project does not involve human subjects or crowdsourcing. Guidelines:

- • The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
- • Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state this in the paper.
- • We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for their institution.
- • For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.

#### 16. Declaration of LLM usage

Question: Does the paper describe the usage of LLMs if it is an important, original, or non-standard component of the core methods in this research? Note that if the LLM is used only for writing, editing, or formatting purposes and does not impact the core methodology, scientific rigorousness, or originality of the research, declaration is not required.

Answer: [NA] Justification: We did not use LLMs for developing our method. Guidelines:

- • The answer NA means that the core method development in this research does not involve LLMs as any important, original, or non-standard components.
- • Please refer to our LLM policy (https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2025/LLM) for what should or should not be described.

### A Appendix

#### A.1 Limitations

While we perform extensive experiments to study the impact of context window on pretraining and demonstrate the effectiveness of SkyLadder, we acknowledge that there are still limitations to be addressed. First, we conduct experiments up to a 3B-model scale and 32K context length, while the latest large language models are typically much larger and capable of processing longer contexts. However, pretraining a large model with a long context window requires prohibitive computational resources beyond our budget. Within our computational capabilities, we have tried to demonstrate the generalizability of SkyLadder across corpora, context window size, model size, and downstream tasks. Thus, we leave it as future work to apply SkyLadder to larger models. Second, we do not include a theoretical analysis to explain the effectiveness of SkyLadder as we mainly focus on empirical insights. We suggest that future work may investigate the relationship between the context window and the training compute to obtain the optimal context window schedule.

#### A.2 Broader Impacts

The work aims to investigate the impact of choices on context windows in language model pretraining and proposes a way to speed up pretraining by scheduling context windows. On the positive side, this improves the efficiency of language model pretraining, making it more accessible and reducing the carbon footprint. Moreover, it enhances the performance of pretrained language models, which may result in better downstream performance in applications. There might be potential misuse of pretrained language models, which is beyond the scope of this work.

#### A.3 Model Architecture

In Table 11, we list the architecture choices of the models trained, including the 120M, 360M, and 1B models based on the TinyLlama architecture [61]. The 3B model is based on Llama3.2 architecture [13].

#### A.4 Training Configurations

We include details of the training configurations in Table 12. All models, irrespective of size or context window length, are trained on this same set of hyperparameters. For most of the hyperparameter values, we follow the TinyLlama [61] project, therefore, our results are highly reproducible.

#### A.5 Implementation

We provide the pseudocode for implementing SkyLadder with Flash Attention 2 [7]. The only change is to apply local causal masking with size w, and combine them with the original document boundaries under the IntraDoc scenario. It can easily be integrated into any model before calculating attention. The rest of the training pipeline remains unchanged.

)

#### A.6 Definition of Per-token Context Window

In Figure 4(d), we show the context window distribution difference between IntraDoc and Random. To clarify, the context window size refers to the number of preceding tokens available in the context window when making the next token prediction. This is different from (a) and (b), where the context length L is the model’s pretrained context window.

Formally, consider a token at index i and an attention mask matrix M, where an entry Mi,j = 0 indicates that token i can attend to token j, and −∞ otherwise. The context window size Ci for the i-th token is defined as Ci = ij=1 1{Mi,j = 0}, where 1{·} is the indicator function that returns 1 when Mi,j = 0 and 0 otherwise. In essence, Ci is the number of tokens available as context for the i-th token, and the distribution of Ci over all pretraining tokens is in Figure 4(d).

For Random, the causal mask is triangular: the i-th token has a context window size equal to i (i.e., C1 = 1, C2 = 2, etc.). Thus, the distribution of Ci is uniform. In contrast, IntraDoc effectively shortens the context length by limiting the cross-document attention.

- In Figure 9. We plot the validation perplexity of models with different context windows under the Random, IntraDoc, and BM25 settings. We observe a consistent trend that a shorter-context model has lower evaluation perplexity on a shorter sequence under all settings.
- In Figure 10, we plot the evaluation perplexity and downstream performance of models with different packing or masking strategies. We conclude that overall, IntraDoc achieves the best performance, with a consistently lower PPL and a higher downstream accuracy. We think that this is partially due to the shorter context window that the IntraDoc model is trained on.

- A.7.2 Ablations for Context Window Study

Base of RoPE. It has been shown that the value of RoPE may have a significant impact on the model’s long context performance, and a longer context requires a larger base [33]. Therefore, we increase the RoPE base to 100,000, which is sufficiently large according to Men et al. [33]. In Figure 11, we observe an improvement for long-context models on long-context evaluation. However, the large gap between a shorter and a longer model still remains, therefore rejecting the hypothesis that the RoPE base is the key contributing factor to the superior performance of short-context models.

#### A.7.3 SkyLadder Evaluation

Statistical Test We test the statistical significance of the performance difference between our models and baselines in Table 1. We use a McNemar test as the two models are evaluated on the same set of questions. The original OLMES suite samples 1000 examples from each benchmark’s full evaluation suite. In contrast, when conducting the McNemar test, we evaluate models on the full set to obtain more statistically meaningful results. We note that OpenBookQA only has 500 questions, making it harder to obtain statistical significance.

Reading Comprehension For reading comprehension, we evaluate the following benchmarks: Hotpot QA (2-shot) [58], SQuAD (4-shot) [41], NaturalQuestions (NQ) (2-shot) [26], TriviaQA (2-shot) [23], and RACE-high (0-shot) [27]. We follow the setup by Zhao et al. [64], where NQ and TriviaQA use retrieved documents as contexts. For RACE, we use lm-evaluation-harness [11] to compare the PPL between options.

Long-context Evaluation We provide additional long-context evaluation on our largest 3B model with an 8K context. This is to mitigate the performance instability of using synthetic benchmarks on small models. We first follow [38] to evaluate model accuracy on reading comprehension benchmarks TOEFL [5, 53] and QuALITY [36]. Next, we evaluate the model’s performance on Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), where the model is provided with many relevant but potentially noisy contexts and needs to locate the correct information. As shown in Table 13, SkyLadder consistently performs better than the baseline across all evaluated RAG and reading comprehension datasets, highlighting its ability to locate correct answers within a lengthy context. In addition, we test the in-context learning ability of the models on text classification benchmarks [64, 44]. Results in Table 14 suggest that SkyLadder shows a significant gain for tasks with many labels, such as DBpedia, while achieving comparable high performance on binary tasks.

Closed-book QA We additionally evaluate the closed-book QA performance of our models without access to any document. We use the evaluation protocol Zhao et al. [64] to measure the exact match. In Table 15, we notice a significant improvement in our methods compared to the baselines for answering closed-book questions. This is consistent with the results that our models show improvements on standard benchmarks that contain commonsense knowledge.

#### A.7.4 SkyLadder Ablations

Combination with BM25 Packing As SkyLadder only changes the context length via masking without altering the underlying data, it is orthogonal to any advanced data packing method such as Shi

et al. [44], Ding et al. [9]. In Table 16, we combine the SkyLadder with the BM25 packing method. We show that the model achieves even better performance on both short and long context evaluation than BM25 without scheduling, which is also better than the Random baseline. This reveals that our method can be combined with more advanced packing techniques to further boost performance.

Combination with Hybrid Attention We note that a recent interesting trend in pretraining models with long context is to use a hybrid attention structure. For instance, Gemma3 [49] uses a mixture of global and local attention layers to balance efficiency and performance of the long-context model. We are curious about the generalizability of SkyLadder to such architecture, and follow Gemma3’s strategy with a global-to-local ratio of 6:1. The results are presented in Table 18. We observe that SkyLadder consistently outperforms the baseline across all evaluation lengths, verifying its applicability. Importantly, SkyLadder works along the time dimension and is combinable with different attention variants, as long as there is a context window to be scheduled. We also verified the effectiveness of SkyLadder on alternative model structures. In Table 19, we pretrain models following the Qwen2.5-0.5B structure, and obtain consistent gains as well.

Long-to-Short Schedule A possibility that SkyLadder works better than baseline on standard benchmarks, which are typically short, might be that the training data mix has more short-context data after applying the mask. To study the effect of pure data distribution, we conduct an ablation of reversing the original short-to-long schedule and name it as the long-to-short schedule. This schedule spends the same number of tokens (64B) in the changing phase, before the constant training phase in L = 8K for another 36B tokens. In Table 17, we show that the long-to-short schedule is not helpful to the model’s performance in both short and long evaluation tasks. This highlights that the context window needs to be scheduled, rather than simply having a data mixture of long and short contexts.

Alternative Schedule Types We explore various types of short-to-long scheduling following different functions as mentioned in Section 4.5. Table 20 shows the details of the schedule as a function of t, and Figure 12 shows an illustration of the different schedule types. In Table 7, we show

Expansion Rate We illustrate the effect of the rate of expansion α in Figure 13. As the evaluation is done on 8K contexts, models with a lower rate (and shorter context window) will have a higher loss as the evaluation length is out-of-distribution. However, eventually, all models’ loss converges to a low level after the schedule reaches 8K. The detailed numbers of validation loss after pretraining can be found in Table 21. Following previous work [10, 17, 24], we consider a loss difference larger than 0.01 as significant. We conclude that setting a reasonable rate of 1/8 balances both short and long-context loss, which is the default setup for our main experiments.

Cyclic Schedule Inspired by the cyclic schedule learning rate [45], we also wonder if cycles are helpful in the schedule. In Figure 14, we show two cyclic schedules. In the “Jump” schedule, w(t) will decrease to ws immediately after reaching L. On the other hand, the “Gradual” schedule means an “M” shape alternating between we and ws. Notably, in the discontinuous Jump schedule, we notice a significant increase in long-context perplexity when we train on only short contexts for an extended period. However, as long as w increases back to L, the performance will return.

In Table 22, we show that these schedules have no major impact on the final performance. This highlights that the method does not introduce additional bias in data selection: different from existing methods such as Pouransari et al. [38] that proposes to train on short data first, followed by long data, we do not assume such a curriculum on data. We argue that the context window size should be independent of the data lengths to avoid bias in training only on certain domains of data.

Initial Window Length We show the effect of having different ws, the initial window length when the training starts. In Table 23, we show that the optimal starting length is 8 tokens. The trend is the same across both α = 1/4 and α = 1/8. This suggests that the starting length should be sufficiently small, irrespective of the expansion rate. It also reveals that prior studies, such as Jin et al. [21] and Pouransari et al. [38] that start with an initial length of 256 could be suboptimal.

Compute Budget We show that when the total number of tokens is limited, our method can still improve language model performance. In Table 24, we choose 12.5B, 25B, and 50B total tokens as the computing budget, and vary the expansion rate so that w reaches L at the same point during training. We observe that under different token budgets, the performance trend is the best: gradually expanding the context window gives better performance than a rapid increase.

Sliding Window Expansion A possible alternative to SkyLadder (using local causal masks by default) is to use a sliding window attention with a window size of w(t) that changes with the training time. Formally, the mask becomes:

0 if i − w ≤ j ≤ i −∞ otherwise.

Mi,j =

so that each token in the context has a fixed preceding context of size w. When w(t) reaches L, the mask becomes equivalent to a causal mask. We compare the performance of the two in Table 25 and observe that the sliding window approach shows slightly better performance in long tasks and worse performance in standard benchmarks. This is likely because overall there are more tokens with longer preceding contexts for the sliding window approach. In both cases, SkyLadder outperforms the Random baseline. We think that future work could further investigate the differences between SkyLadder implementations with causal and sliding window attention, such as the formation of attention sink [14]. There could also be possible combinations of the two: for instance, using a local mask first to disable distraction, and enabling sliding windows as the training progresses.

#### A.8 Additional Comparison with Related Work

We acknowledge that there are several prior works discovering a similar pattern of short-to-long pretraining. For instance, Li et al. [28] discover that using a sequence-length warmup for the initial steps in pretraining improves model stability. However, they mostly focus on stability in training loss and do not show a clear performance gain across multiple evaluations and larger scales. Moreover, we demonstrate that the benefits of scheduling a model’s context window go beyond only the warmup stage. In Table 21’s first row, simply warming up the model with 8B tokens results in suboptimal performance compared to a slower expansion rate. This validates that the context window should be

- Table 25: Performance (%) of 1B models with different masking schemes. All models are trained on the same 100B FineWeb-Pro tokens with a final context length of 8K. Both implementations of SkyLadder outperform the baseline, and the sliding window approach excels at long tasks with a slight performance drop on standard benchmarks.

considered as a factor to schedule over the entire training course, which also differentiates us from Li et al. [28] that only consider the warmup stage.

Another related work is Jin et al. [21] where the authors use progressive sequence lengths to accelerate training. However, their method leads to worse performance under the same token budget, while our SkyLadder shows both time saving and performance improvement with the same number of tokens. We suspect that this might be because of the suboptimal schedule they used. Moreover, their study is limited to observing the training loss of small models (up to 410M parameters), while we comprehensively show performance gain across multiple corpora, model sizes, context sizes, and a wide variety of tasks. Overall, we systematically conduct controlled experiments on the impact of context window scheduling in pretraining, providing insights to explain these previous studies.

A.9 Compute Information

We conducted all of our experiments for models with ≤ 1B size on an internal cluster of NVIDIA A100 nodes with 40G memory. Experiments with 3B models were conducted on H100 nodes. There are additional preliminary experiments that we did not include in the paper, which account for a fraction of the total compute. The detailed computation for each experiment is as follows: For the preliminary study on context window, pretraining a 1B model with 100B tokens (with 8K context) takes around 200 hours on a node of 8 A100s. Models of different sizes scale accordingly. For instance, plotting Figure 4(a) and (b) requires a total of 159 days of pretraining on a single node. For SkyLadder experiments, the baseline pretraining using various corpora takes the same time, and SkyLadder speeds up the training by 13% to 22% depending on the context length.

A.10 Dataset Statistics

In this section, we provide detailed statistics of the datasets used in our study. These include the document length distributions of the pretraining corpora, the characteristics of the evaluation datasets, and the input length statistics of standard reasoning benchmarks.

- Table 26 reports the document length statistics for the two pretraining corpora, CommonCrawl and FineWeb-Pro. Both distributions are strongly right-skewed, indicating that long documents are rare. Compared to FineWeb-Pro, CommonCrawl generally contains longer documents, while FineWeb-Pro has been more carefully cleaned and filtered.

- Table 27 shows the input length characteristics of common reasoning and knowledge benchmarks, including ARC, CSQA, HellaSwag, OBQA, PIQA, SocialIQA, Winogrande, and MMLU. While these benchmarks consist of relatively short contexts, they remain standard for assessing a model’s factual consistency and reasoning ability. Importantly, a long-context model should maintain stable behavior even when the user provides a short query.
