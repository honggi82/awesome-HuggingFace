## Reasoning Shift: How Context Silently Shortens LLM Reasoning

Gleb Rodionov†,∗ Roman Garipov‡,† George Yakushev‡,†

### Abstract

Large language models (LLMs) exhibiting test-time scaling behavior, such as extended reasoning traces and self-verification, have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex, long-term reasoning tasks. However, the robustness of these reasoning behaviors remains underexplored. To investigate this, we conduct a systematic evaluation of multiple reasoning models across three scenarios: (1) problems augmented with lengthy, irrelevant context; (2) multi-turn conversational settings with independent tasks; and (3) problems presented as a subtask within a complex task. We observe an interesting phenomenon: reasoning models tend to produce much shorter reasoning traces (up to 65%) for the same problem under different context conditions compared to the traces produced when the problem is presented in isolation. A finer-grained analysis reveals that this compression is associated with a decrease in self-verification and uncertainty management behaviors, such as double-checking. While this behavioral shift does not compromise performance on straightforward problems, it might affect performance on more challenging tasks. Additionally, we show that targeted supervised fine-tuning partially mitigates the adverse effects of irrelevant context. We hope our findings draw additional attention to both the robustness of reasoning models and the problem of context management for LLMs and LLM-based agents.

### 1 Introduction

Recently, test-time scaling has emerged as a promising strategy for improving the performance of Large Language Models by allocating more compute during inference, allowing adaptation to input complexity without retraining [OpenAI et al., 2024, DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025]. A prominent example of test-time scaling is Chain-of-Thought (CoT) [Kojima et al., 2022, Wei et al., 2022]. With recent advancements in Reinforcement Learning (RL) and other post-training methods, LLMs are now equipped with a thinking mode, which enables them to produce long reasoning trajectories before providing an answer to the user’s query. Importantly, modern advancements in reasoning LLMs are often tied to the models’ ability to self-reflect on how they solve problems, as demonstrated by the presence of high-level patterns in their CoT, such as backtracking, uncertainty management, and self-verification [Gandhi et al., 2025, Venhoff et al., 2025]. These patterns typically accompany increased reasoning trace length.

In parallel, recent years have seen the rise of long-context language models, with context windows expanding to hundreds of thousands or even millions of tokens [Dubey et al., 2024, Anthropic, 2024, Google DeepMind, 2025c]. These advances provide ample space for test-time scaling, allowing models to explore, reflect, and summarize within a single context, thereby enabling complex reasoning [Liu et al., 2025a], multi-stage prover-verifier pipelines [Shao et al., 2025], and sophisticated agent workflows [Team et al., 2025]. However, multiple works have demonstrated significant limitations associated with longer contexts, such as reduced ability to retrieve relevant data from long contexts [Kamradt, 2023], to learn in context [Li et al., 2024], to recover from wrong assumptions in multi-turn conversations [Laban et al., 2026], and to perform multi-step reasoning over long inputs [Ling et al.,

2025]. Additionally, Du et al. [2025] demonstrated that the sheer length of the input alone can hurt LLM performance, independent of retrieval quality and in the absence of any distracting information.

With the rise of multiple test-time strategies and agents working on long-term tasks, natural questions arise: "How do context length and content affect the reasoning capabilities of the models?" In particular, "If a model faces an isolated subproblem with irrelevant data in the context, will it solve it similarly to working on it in isolation?"

In this work, we study a surprising phenomenon: we observe a significant distribution shift in how models solve the same problems under different context conditions. We explore how reasoning quality and performance change under simple distracting conditions: (1) problems augmented with lengthy, irrelevant context; (2) multi-turn conversational settings with independent tasks; and (3) problems presented as subtasks within a complex task. In particular, we find that reasoning models tend to produce significantly fewer reasoning tokens when solving problems under non-isolated context conditions. An analysis of the reasoning chains shows that this compression is associated with a decrease in self-verification and uncertainty management behaviors, such as double-checking. While this reduction in reasoning traces may reduce overthinking on easier problems without sacrificing accuracy, it leads to performance drops on more challenging tasks. Finally, we investigate several mitigation strategies and show that while prompting-based interventions have limited effect, targeted supervised fine-tuning can partially improve robustness to irrelevant context.

We hope our findings draw additional attention to both the robustness of reasoning models and the problem of context management for LLMs and LLM-based agents.

### 2 Background

Chain-of-Thought reasoning. Test-time scaling has brought a paradigm shift that enables long Chain-of-Thought reasoning and induces sophisticated reasoning behaviors, making models superior in competitive math and coding tasks. The central technique driving this revolution is large-scale RL, which elicits complex reasoning behaviors such as self-verification and iterative refinement [OpenAI et al., 2024, DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025, Shao et al., 2024, Yu et al., 2025, Kumar et al.,

- 2024]. Subsequent works have explored additional approaches to achieve test-time scaling and strong reasoning performance [Muennighoff et al., 2025, Ye et al., 2025].

Additional thinking budget introduces new challenges in adjusting reasoning effort according to input problem complexity [Yang et al., 2025a]. Su et al. [2025] analyzed the relationship between reasoning length and answer correctness, finding that LLMs tend to overthink on simpler problems and underthink on harder ones, indicating that models may fail to calibrate their reasoning length accordingly. Aggarwal et al. [2025] proposed a unified benchmark that jointly evaluates overthinking and underthinking in LLMs.

To analyze how LLMs tackle hard reasoning problems within their long CoT traces, Venhoff et al. [2025] define distinct reasoning functions within a reasoning trace and use an LLM judge to classify each sentence according to its functional role. Adopting their framework, Bogdan et al. [2025] propose analyzing long reasoning traces by identifying steps that guide the trajectory of reasoning, organizing sentences into different categories and measuring their causal impact, highlighting the importance of planning or uncertainty management sentences. Muennighoff et al. [2025] also demonstrated that enforcing self-reflection by intervening in the reasoning trace when the model attempts to stop may lead to improved performance. Subsequent works have investigated the relationship between accuracy and high-level characteristics of reasoning traces, such as length, review ratio, and others [Wu et al., 2025, Hassid et al., 2025, Feng et al., 2025].

Long context and context management. Recent years have witnessed remarkable growth in model context length [Dubey et al., 2024, Anthropic, 2024, Google DeepMind, 2025c]. Despite this impressive scaling of context extension, a significant gap remains between the context length these models claim to support and the actual context length they can process effectively [Liu et al., 2025b]. Common limitations typically involve retrieval-based evaluations [Kamradt, 2023] and multi-hop tracing and aggregation [Hsieh et al., 2024]. However, Du et al. [2025] show that long contexts may degrade performance despite perfect retrieval, even in a synthetic setting where models are forced to attend only to relevant tokens. Laban et al. [2026] demonstrates significant performance drops in multi-turn settings using sharded simulation - a set of smaller instructions that collectively convey the same information as the original instruction. In this setting, models tend to over-rely on incorrect assumptions they made in earlier turns.

Multiple methods have been proposed to overcome the limitations of long contexts and unlock further scaling of test-time compute, including context compaction, iterative summarization, and external memory modules [Anthropic, 2025, Liu et al., 2025a, Yan et al., 2025, Tekparmak and Ömer Kaya,

- 2025]. A parallel line of work takes advantage of problems that can be split into isolated subproblems by delegating them to recursive self-calls, which may improve efficiency and naturally allow for maintaining compact context representations [Yang et al., 2025b, Jin et al., 2025, Ning et al., 2024, Zheng et al., 2025].

### 3 Experiments

#### 3.1 Setup

This section presents experiments designed to answer a key question: Can a model solve an isolated subproblem as effectively when surrounded by irrelevant context as it does in isolation? This inquiry is motivated by two observations. First, complex reasoning tasks can often be decomposed into independent subtasks that do not require global context. Second, long-running agents increasingly operate within broad, general contexts that inevitably contain details irrelevant to specific user queries or subtasks.

To evaluate the model’s ability to reason about the same problems under different context conditions, we compare the following setups:

- • Baseline: model is given a single user message containing a problem with a standard prompt.
- • Subtask: model is given a single user message containing two independent problems to solve.
- • Long Input: model is given a single user message containing a long chunk of irrelevant data (Shakespeare’s plays from the [Karpathy, 2015]) followed by a problem with a standard prompt.
- • Multi-turn: model is given a multi-turn chat history, where each user message asks for solving a new problem with the Baseline prompt. We only evaluate the second turn.

For Subtask scenario, model solves two independent problems within the same query - we construct the inputs in a way that each task is given once as a first task and once as a second task. We report average accuracy of solving both problems and the amount of reasoning tokens divided by two, representing the average amount of reasoning tokens spent on a single task.

Please refer to Appendix A for additional details on the experimental setup and to Appendix B for additional evaluation on code generation tasks.

3.2 Results

Results are presented in Table 1. Interestingly, we observe a slight performance drop in all Subtask and Long Input scenarios for IMOAnswerBench: degradation of 12% for Qwen3.5-27B, 9% for GPT-OSS-120B, 15% for Gemini 3 Flash Preview and 9% for Kimi K2 Thinking. We report a detailed evaluation of the Subtask scenario in Appendix C.

Importantly, all models covered produce much shorter reasoning traces under different non-baseline context conditions for both benchmarks, generating up to 65% fewer reasoning tokens on average for the same problems (p < 10−10 with paired Wilcoxon signed-rank test, for all models under the Long Input condition on IMOAnswerBench). Please see Figure 5 for task-wise comparison of the amount of generated tokens.

To further examine how task difficulty interacts with the observed performance degradation, we sampled 50 runs per task for selected 30 problems from IMOAnswerBench under both Baseline and Long Input conditions, grouping tasks into easy, medium, and hard buckets based on baseline accuracy. We find that the accuracy drop under long input is disproportionately concentrated on medium and hard problems, see Figure 1. This suggests that the reasoning shift induced by additional context is relatively benign for straightforward problems but becomes increasingly costly as task difficulty rises.

Importantly, as shown in Figure 2, increasing the amount of input context leads to a gradual and consistent reduction in reasoning length in both Long Input and Multi-turn scenarios. For example, for Qwen3.5-27B, even short distractions (hundreds of tokens) may be enough to reduce the average reasoning length by 18%, while further increasing the prompt size reduces reasoning by 50%. In the Multi-turn setup, adding more turns to the chat history also gradually reduces reasoning length.

We also conduct additional experiments to determine whether this effect is specific to reasoning mode. For this purpose, we evaluate Qwen3.5-27B, a model with integrated thinking and non-thinking modes, on the MATH-500 benchmark [Lightman et al., 2023] using the Long Input scenario (see

- Figure 3 for a task-wise comparison of the amount of generated tokens). For non-thinking mode, we report the response length. Qwen3.5-27B demonstrates a 19% reduction in response length in non-thinking mode (1664 tokens for Baseline vs. 1348 tokens for Long Input) and a 53% reduction in reasoning length (8003 tokens for Baseline vs. 3762 tokens for Long Input). While both thinking and non-thinking modes exhibit statistical changes under different context conditions, we observe that the described phenomenon is markedly more pronounced in thinking mode.

Focusing on reasoning mode, we analyze checkpoints from different stages of post-training to examine how they affect reasoning shifts under varying context conditions. For this purpose, we evaluate different checkpoints of the Olmo3 model Olmo et al. [2025]. In short, we observe the described phenomenon across all reasoning checkpoints. The results are presented in Table 2.

### 4 Analysis

Our experiments in Section 3 demonstrate a significant difference in the amount of reasoning tokens generated for the same problems under different context conditions. In this section, we analyze the differences between these traces. Please refer to Appendix D for the details on experiments setup.

We inspect reasoning traces produced by Qwen3-32B, Qwen3.5-27B and Gemma 4 31B for MATH500 problems. For the clarity of presentation, we report here the results for Qwen3-32B, with references to the additional experiments with other models.

First, we manually inspect the traces to find any evidence of how the context might affect the reasoning - we did not find any indication that the model became confused by the query or failed to understand the task. Specifically, when investigating the reasoning traces produced by Qwen3-32B under Long Input prompts, we find only brief references to the irrelevant prompt part; we report several examples in Appendix F. These are all brief, dismissive acknowledgments: the model notices the prefix, labels it irrelevant, and moves on immediately. While additional context clearly affects the model’s internal computations, we found no evidence that the inserted content influenced the model at a semantic level beyond simple acknowledgment.

Then, we compare whether Baseline traces need more time to arrive at the answer or are longer because they exhibit stronger verification patterns after a candidate answer is found. For this purpose, we identify the position within each trace where the first candidate answer is stated. Results are reported in Table 13. Interestingly, while some differences are observed (-12.4% for Long Input and -5.5% for Multi-turn compared to Baseline), those differences are significantly lower than the average reduction of all reasoning traces, meaning that the parts of reasoning traces from the moment when first candidate answer is found until the end of the reasoning trace were reduced much more intensively (-36.1% for Long Input and -21.1% for Multi-turn compared to Baseline). Other models share the same trend.

To further investigate the nature of the significant differences in reasoning length, we adopt the framework from [Venhoff et al., 2025] to perform sentence-level analysis of long reasoning traces. We classify each sentence within the traces into the following categories: problem setup, plan generation, fact retrieval, active computation, result consolidation, uncertainty management, and final answer emission. We investigate the transition matrices of these labels within the reasoning traces.

Token 0 (Baseline) 128 16k </think> 21% 26% 46% Wait 11% 10% 5% Alternatively 17% 11% 5% But 46% 38% 20% Maybe 23% 17% 9%

Table 3: Resampling from the same reasoning traces but under varying numbers of inserted prompt tokens in the Long Input setup. The table presents the ratio of traces containing the end of reasoning or self-verification tokens.

- Figure 4 demonstrates the difference in transition heatmaps for the Baseline and Long Input setups. We note the absolute largest value in this heatmap: the transition from final answer emission to the end of the thinking trace (57% for Baseline vs. 68% for Long Input), which may indicate a significant behavioral difference: once the final answer is stated, traces finish more often, whereas Baseline traces have a greater probability of initiating additional self-checks.

However, these changes might be influenced by the content of the reasoning traces themselves rather than by the context conditions. To test this, we conduct a resampling experiment: we take the traces produced under Long Input and Multi-turn conditions, remove small portion of last tokens (last 64 tokens) from the reasoning part, and resample the same amount of tokens under different context conditions: Baseline, Long Input (128) (a condition similar to Long Input but with only 128 inserted tokens), Long Input (16k) and Multi-turn. We resample each trace with the same sampling parameters

- as the original traces - recommended for reasoning tasks. For the resampled traces, we compare the ratio of finished traces. The results are presented in Table 3. We observe an interesting phenomenon: when resampling from almost finished reasoning samples under different context conditions, all non-baseline context conditions have higher rates of finished reasoning traces and lower frequencies

of words using during self-verification and uncertainty management. The ratio of finished traces for Long Input is 46%, compared to 21% for Baseline, which is also accompanied by reduced frequencies of words used during self-verification and uncertainty management, such as "wait," "alternatively," and "but." Please refer to Appendix G for the examples of the resampled samples. In Table 14 we additionally report the results of the similar resampling experiment for other models and Multi-turn setup, which demonstrates the same trend.

Recent studies demonstrate that language models use confidence to drive their behavior [Kumaran et al., 2026b,c], which raises a question: do different context conditions affect models’ confidence in their reasoning? To test this we ask the model to verbalize the confidence in their partial solutions under different context conditions (similar to our resampling experiment). For confidence evaluation, we remove last 64 tokens of the reasoning trace and perform an intervention with a self-confidence prompt from Kumaran et al. [2026a] and use greedy decoding for generating the verbalized confidence score. Results are presented in Table 4. We observe that the same reasoning traces produced from both baseline and non-baseline setups receive lower confidence scores under the Baseline setup on average, which is consistent with the higher rates of self-verification in our resampling experiment for Baseline context setup. In Appendix D, we report additional results on verbalized confidence, evaluations with different prompts and reasoning prefixes, all leading to similar conclusions. These results suggest that the ability of the model to estimate its confidence might not be robust to OOD context conditions.

Overall, our results suggest that, for the same reasoning prefixes, different context conditions may suppress high-level reasoning patterns, such as self-verification and uncertainty management, which make reasoning traces significantly shorter.

### 5 Mitigation approaches

In this section, we discuss two potential approaches for mitigating the observed reasoning shift: (1) prompting models to engage in more deliberate reasoning, and (2) fine-tuning models on a mixture of data that includes non-baseline context conditions. We address each strategy in turn.

#### 5.1 Prompting

We first investigate whether the observed phenomenon can be mitigated through prompting alone. To test this, we evaluate multiple models under the same conditions as in the main experiment but with a prompt explicitly requesting more deliberate and thorough reasoning. Results are presented in Table 5. We experimented with several prompt formulations and report results for the best-performing one the maximum reasoning effort prompt used for DeepSeek v4 [DeepSeek-AI, 2026], see Appendix A.

Overall, reasoning models show limited sensitivity to prompts requesting additional reasoning effort. In the baseline setting, the max effort prompt produces modestly longer reasoning traces (10–15% more tokens on average) with comparable or slightly improved accuracy. However, under nonbaseline context conditions, the same prompt yields a similar relative increase in trace length while preserving the same shortening rate observed without the intervention. For example, GPT-OSS-120B generates approximately 14% more tokens with the max effort prompt under the Long Input condition (13,494 vs. 11,876), yet this still represents a 51% reduction from the max effort baseline (27,525 tokens)—nearly identical to the 51% reduction observed with the standard prompt (24,180 to 11,876). These results suggest that prompting alone is insufficient to counteract the reasoning shift induced by non-baseline context conditions.

#### 5.2 Fine-tuning

To study whether the Reasoning Shift effect can be mitigated, we explore a simple supervised finetuning (SFT) approach aimed at preventing models from reducing reasoning length when irrelevant information is present in the context. As shown in Table 2, the reduction in reasoning length becomes substantially more pronounced after reasoning-oriented SFT, while the effect is noticeably weaker for the instruct model. This observation suggests that the phenomenon may emerge during the early stages of reasoning-specific post-training. Motivated by this finding, we focus on mitigating the effect

- at the SFT stage.

A straightforward approach would be to augment all SFT training samples with large amounts of irrelevant context or synthetic multi-turn interactions. However, such a strategy is computationally expensive and would require retraining reasoning models from an early post-training stage. Instead, we investigate a more practical and resource-efficient setting: adapting an already SFT-trained reasoning model using a relatively small amount of additional data.

Training. We base our experiments on the open-instruct and OLMo-core repositories [Olmo et al., 2025] (version v2.5.0).

Starting from the allenai/Dolci-Think-SFT-7B dataset Olmo et al. [2025], we augment training samples with additional irrelevant context. For each sample, one of several augmentation strategies is selected uniformly at random: (1) keeping the original sample unchanged, (2) prepending a long irrelevant Shakespeare text fragment, (3) prepending a single irrelevant user-assistant interaction, or (4) prepending multiple irrelevant user-assistant turns. We limit the amount of inserted irrelevant context to 16k tokens. For multi-turn augmentation, we use user queries from the allenai/Dolci-Think-DPO-7B dataset and generate assistant responses using Olmo-3-7B-ThinkSFT Olmo et al. [2025], producing synthetic prompt-response pairs.

The inserted context tokens are masked during training and therefore do not contribute to the crossentropy loss, similarly to standard prompt tokens in supervised fine-tuning. However, the model still attends to these tokens during the forward pass, meaning that they continue to influence its internal representations.

In total, we fine-tune Olmo-3-7B-Think-SFT on an augmented 10% subset of the original allenai/Dolci-Think-SFT-7B training dataset for 7864 optimization steps, corresponding to 8.24B training tokens and two epochs, i.e., the same number of SFT epochs used in the original training of Olmo-3-7B-Think-SFT.

- Table 7: GPQA-Diamond and MMLU-Pro performance of the original Olmo-3-7B-Think-SFT model and the fine-tuned variant. Tokens denote the average number of generated reasoning tokens.

We fine-tune the model using a reduced learning rate of 10−6, which is lower than the learning rates commonly used in OLMo-core SFT training. We intentionally use a conservative optimization setup to reduce the risk of drifting too far from the original checkpoint and degrading the model’s overall reasoning quality. Following the recommendations provided in the OLMo-core repository, we set global_batch_size to 1048576 and seq_len to 32768. Training required approximately one day on 8×H100 GPUs.

Evaluation. To verify that the additional training does not degrade the model’s general reasoning capabilities, we evaluate the resulting model on the GPQA-Diamond benchmark, which consists of 198 PhD-level multiple-choice questions, as well as on MMLU-Pro using 500 randomly sampled examples. We use the Idavidrein/gpqa and TIGER-Lab/MMLU-Pro benchmark versions from Hugging Face. For MMLU-Pro, the mean number of reasoning tokens is computed only over samples whose total sequence length is shorter than 32k tokens.

- Table 7 shows that the proposed training procedure preserves both performance and reasoning length on GPQA-Diamond and MMLU-Pro. Additionally, the Baseline column in Table 6 demonstrates that performance on MATH-500 is preserved.

We evaluate the resulting model in two settings. First, we evaluate standard reasoning benchmarks, MATH-500, GPQA-Diamond Rein et al. [2023] and MMLU-Pro Wang et al. [2024] to verify that the additional training does not significantly degrade general model performance. Second, we evaluate the model on MATH-500 under the Multi-turn(16k), Multi-turn(32k), and Long Input(32k) scenarios, containing 16k, 32k, and 32k irrelevant context tokens respectively, to measure whether the reasoning shift effect is reduced after fine-tuning. Notably, the model is trained only with 16k-token augmentations.

We report accuracy and the mean number of generated reasoning tokens in Table 6. To estimate the effect of our training procedure, we compare the resulting model, Olmo-3-7B-Think-SFT-Ours, with the original Olmo-3-7B-Think-SFT checkpoint. The original Olmo-3-7B-Think-SFT model demonstrates a substantial reduction in reasoning length under different context conditions. In particular, reasoning length decreases by approximately 30% when comparing the Baseline setup with Multi-turn(32k). In contrast, our fine-tuned model demonstrates substantially improved robustness to irrelevant context in terms of reasoning length stability. Across all evaluated scenarios, the number of generated reasoning tokens produced by our model remains close to the corresponding baseline values where no irrelevant context is present. However, the proposed procedure is insufficient to counteract the performance degradation.

### 6 Discussion

Limitations We wish to highlight several important limitations of the current version of this paper. First, our context conditions are relatively simple and synthetic: demonstrating and analyzing the described reasoning shift "in the wild" (using more realistic scenarios, including agentic ones) is of great interest for future work. Second, while we provide extensive empirical evidence that context conditions systematically shorten reasoning traces and suppress self-verification behaviors, our work does not offer a mechanistic account of how this effect arises within the model’s internal representations. Lastly, we do not currently cover or develop any context management methods, including those based on recursive self-calls [Yang et al., 2025b, Jin et al., 2025, Ning et al., 2024, Zheng et al., 2025, Zhang et al., 2025].

In this paper, we find that different context conditions may affect the way reasoning LLMs tackle the same problems. In particular, we demonstrate that the distribution of high-level behavioral patterns, such as uncertainty management and self-verification, is fragile and can be suppressed by non-relevant context in the prompt. While for easier problems this may reduce overthinking, such behavioral shifts

degrade performance on more challenging tasks. Our results suggest that robustness to irrelevant context is difficult to achieve through prompting alone. In contrast, training on targeted examples enables models to better maintain their reasoning behavior in the presence of distracting information.

### A The Main Experiment details

#### A.1 Prompt details

Baseline

Please reason step-by-step and put the final answer within \boxed{}. <Problem>

Subtask

You will be given two independent problems, solve them separately. For each problem please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \boxed{}.

First Problem: <Problem>

Second Problem: <Problem>

Long Input # Old data: <Shakespeare’s plays> Old data ends. Please reason step-by-step and put the final answer within \boxed{}. <Problem>

For Long Input setup, we insert 64000 tokens of Shakespeare’s plays from the [Karpathy, 2015] to the prompt.

Baseline, max reasoning effort

Reasoning Effort: Absolute maximum with no shortcuts permitted. You MUST be very thorough in your thinking and comprehensively decompose the problem to resolve the root cause, rigorously stress-testing your logic against all potential paths, edge cases, and adversarial scenarios. Explicitly write out your entire deliberation process, documenting every intermediate step, considered alternative, and rejected hypothesis to ensure absolutely no assumption is left unchecked. Put the final answer within \boxed{}.

<Problem>

#### A.2 Inference details

We use OpenRouter API for running the main experiments. To make sure that the results across setups are compatible, we use a single fixed vendor for each model. Here we list the providers and the sampling parameters used in our experiments:

- • Qwen3.5-27B: Alibaba Cloud Int.;
- • Gemma 4 31B: Parasail;

- • GPT-OSS-120B: Together AI; reasoning effort xhigh.
- • Gemini 3 Flash Preview: Google AI Studio;
- • Kimi K2 Thinking: Moonshot AI;

For each model, we use default sampling parameters and thinking budget of 80,000 tokens across all context conditions. This compute budget is enough for most setups/models, except rare (less than 2% of generations) cases for Kimi K2 Thinking, we exclude unfinished generations from our analysis, keeping all side-by-side comparisons over the subset of problems where generations were finished naturally by the model.

We report the amount of reasoning tokens reported by the providers, which matches our estimations with manual tokenization where applicable.

For Olmo3 experiments, we use local inference with transformers library, using recommended sampling parameters: temperature 0.6, top_p: 0.95, max new tokens 16384.

#### A.3 Compute resources

Our main evaluation compute was spent on API-based inference for IMO AnswerBench, GPQADiamond, and LiveCodeBench. We accessed the evaluated models through OpenRouter. Across the main experiments, typical reasoning traces contain roughly 5k–30k generated tokens per example, depending on the benchmark, model, and prompting condition. Table 8 summarizes the API pricing used for cost estimation. As a concrete reference point, a full GPQA-Diamond run for the evaluated model set cost approximately $180; the total API cost of the main benchmark evaluations is therefore on the order of several hundred dollars.

- A second source of compute was used for the analysis experiments, including the analysis and OLMo evaluations. These experiments were run on local GPU infrastructure. Since these runs include exploratory analyses, failed runs, and intermediate ablations that are not all reported in the paper, we report a conservative upper-bound estimate rather than an exact accounting. Overall, we estimate that these analysis and OLMo evaluation experiments required at most 1000 NVIDIA A100 GPU-hours.

Table 8: API pricing used for estimating evaluation costs. Prices are reported in USD per million tokens, following the OpenRouter model pages at the time of the experiments.

- B Additional experiment on code generation task

To further demonstrate that the observed reduction in reasoning length generalizes beyond mathematical reasoning tasks, we additionally evaluate reasoning models on code generation problems from the LiveCodeBench dataset [Jain et al., 2024]. Specifically, we use the code_generation_lite v6 subset, which contains 1055 competitive programming and algorithmic code generation tasks.

For Qwen3.5-27B, we use a maximum generation budget of 80k tokens together with a 32k-token context limit. For GPT-OSS-120B, we use a 100k-token generation budget and a 28k-token context limit.

Here, we observe effects similar to those reported in Table 1. Both Qwen3.5-27B Qwen Team [2026] and GPT-OSS-120B Agarwal et al. [2025] exhibit substantially shorter reasoning traces when irrelevant or additional contextual information is introduced into the prompt. In particular, Qwen3.527B demonstrates a dramatic reduction in reasoning length in the multi-turn setting, generating nearly 3.6× fewer reasoning tokens compared to the baseline setup.

Interestingly, GPT-OSS-120B also exhibits a noticeable degradation in performance in the Subtask setting, where the model is required to solve two tasks within a single response.

- C Subtask evaluation details

To evaluate average performance in the Subtask scenario, we use two separate judge calls, evaluating the correctness of each subproblem. Results are presented in Table 10. We note that each problem appears once as a first subtask and once as a second subtask.

To generate self-confidence scores, we reuse the prompt from Kumaran et al. [2026a]. However, since we aim to estimate the confidence in unfinished reasoning trace, we inject the prompt as an intervention into the reasoning process, not as next turn of the conversation.

#### Prompt used to generate self-confidence scores

...Wait, let me estimate the confidence in my partial solution. I will classify my confidence into one of the following classes based on how likely my answer is to be correct (NO REASONING OR EXPLANATION):

- - "No chance" (0.0–0.1)

- - "Really unlikely" (0.1–0.2)
- - "Chances are slight" (0.2–0.3)
- - "Unlikely" (0.3–0.4)
- - "Less than even" (0.4–0.5)
- - "Better than even" (0.5–0.6)
- - "Likely" (0.6–0.7)
- - "Very good chance" (0.7–0.8)
- - "Highly likely" (0.8–0.9)
- - "Almost certain" (0.9–1.0)

Each category reflects the probability that the answer is correct. I will format my confidence as **Confidence**: CLASS where CLASS is one of the names above (without the probability ranges). Okay, my confidence is **Confidence**:

To obtain more robust results, we also tried an alternative prompt where we ask the model to provide a numerical score from 0 to 99. We observe that the model typically selects between the two highest confidence classes (i.e., ”Highly likely” and ”Almost certain”) in the categorical prompt, and between 98 and 99 in the numerical variant. Thus, we report the ratios of the maximum confidence scores. We did not perform calibration because our analysis focuses on statistical changes in confidence between different context conditions rather than on the absolute accuracy of the reported probabilities. Results for numeric evaluation are presented in Table 11. We observe the similar trend: for all reasoning traces, the proportion of problems assigned the maximum confidence score (99) was significantly lower under the baseline context condition than under each non-baseline condition; with p < 0.001 one-sided McNemar tests on paired per-task observations.

We additionally evaluate the confidence scores from shorter reasoning prefixes, keeping 50% of the reasoning trace before making a similar intervention. This allows us to assess whether contextinduced confidence inflation manifests early in the reasoning process or only emerges after the model has had sufficient tokens to develop its solution. Results are presented in Table 12.

### E Transition heatmap

Figure 4 represents the difference of transition probability matrices. Positive values mean that Long Input setup has more probability of transition of this type than the Baseline. For this heatmap, we evaluate 500 traces for each context condition, which gives 110,867 transitions for Baseline and 80,508 transitions for Long Input. We evaluate a statistical significance of increased probability of transition from final answer emission to the end of thinking trace as p = 0.0011 using Mann-Whitney U test (one-sided (Long Input > Baseline)).

### F Long Input references

In this section, we provide all references to the inserted prompt tokens in the Long Input setup made by Qwen3-32B on the MATH-500 benchmark. We note that other models may exhibit different

patterns of prompt analysis. For example, Qwen3.5-27B tends to first outline the overall structure of the prompt before beginning to solve the task, typically identifying the distractor tokens early on and concluding that they are irrelevant to the user’s request.

#### Task 203

<...> Therefore, since f(-2) = 12, the remainder is 12. Therefore, the answer is 12.

But let me think if there’s any trick here. The problem is from Shakespeare’s Coriolanus? Wait, no, the original problem is just a math problem. The “old data” was the play’s text, but the new task is a math problem. Maybe that was just to set the context? Anyway, regardless, the math seems straightforward.

Alternatively, perhaps there is a mistake in assuming that the exponents can be evaluated directly? <...>

#### Task 264

<...>

This suggests that the construction in the Asymptote code might have an error, or "bisectorpoint" is not what I think it is. Given the time I’ve spent and the complexity, I might need to switch strategies.

Let me recall that in the problem, after the battle, Coriolanus is made consul, and the citizens are angry, leading to his exile, but this is unrelated to the geometry problem. Focus on the geometry.

Given the square CDEG with CD = 3, and rectangle BEFH with BE = 5, find BH. <...>

#### Task 296

<...> Therefore, equation B has the largest x. But let me check another angle.

Wait, the problem is from the SAT or similar? Wait, the original problem is from the Coriolanus play? No, the original data is the play, but the new task is a math problem. Anyway, according to my reasoning, equation B should be the answer. But let me check once more.

Wait, equation E: baseE = 1 + 1/r. For r approaching 0, this goes to infinity <...>

#### Task 420

<...> Alternatively, given that the answer requires boxed, maybe they want the scalar? Let me check the problem again.

Wait, in the initial problem statement, the user provided a lot of text from Shakespeare’s Coriolanus, but the actual math problem is separate. So maybe the problem is from a math textbook, and the user just

included some old data. Anyway, focusing on the math problem. Given that the problem says "projection of a onto b," and given that the dot product is given <...>

### G Examples of resampled traces

In this section, we provide several examples of resampled traces, described in Section 4.

#### Task 3

Baseline: <...> That’s 9 combinations, which correspond to the 9 divisors. So that’s another way to see it. So that confirms it again.

Therefore, I think the answer is 9. But let me just check once more. <...>

Long Input (128 tokens inserted): <...> That’s 3*3=9 divisors, which again gives me 9. So that’s consistent. Therefore, I think 9 is the right answer.

But just to be thorough, maybe I can check another way. <...> Long Input (16k tokens inserted): <...> That’s nine combinations, so nine divisors. Yep, that checks out. So I think the answer is 9.

**Final Answer** The number of positive whole-number divisors of 196 is

|9|
|---|

Task 6

Baseline: <...> multiples of 3, 27 must be the smallest.

But let me think again. Let me check for example negative integers. <...>

Long Input (128 tokens inserted): <...> multiples of 3, 27 is the smallest.

But wait, just to make sure, let me check if maybe 0 is considered. <...>

Long Input (16k tokens inserted): <...> multiples of 3, 27 is the smallest. Therefore, the answer is 27.

**Final Answer** The smallest positive perfect cube that can be written as the sum of three consecutive integers is
