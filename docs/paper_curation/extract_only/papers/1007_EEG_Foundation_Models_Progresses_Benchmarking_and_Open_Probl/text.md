Abstract—Electroencephalography (EEG) foundation models have recently emerged as a promising paradigm for braincomputer interfaces (BCIs), aiming to learn transferable neural representations from large-scale heterogeneous recordings. Despite rapid progresses, there lacks fair and comprehensive comparisons of existing EEG foundation models, due to inconsistent pre-training objectives, preprocessing choices, and downstream evaluation protocols. This paper fills this gap. We first review 50 representative models and organize their design choices into a unified taxonomic framework including data standardization, model architectures, and self-supervised pre-training strategies. We then evaluate 12 open-source foundation models and competitive specialist baselines across 13 EEG datasets spanning nine BCI paradigms. Emphasizing real-world deployments, we consider both cross-subject generalization under a leave-onesubject-out protocol and rapid calibration under a within-subject few-shot setting. We further compare full-parameter fine-tuning with linear probing to assess the transferability of pre-trained representations, and examine the relationship between model scale and downstream performance. Our results indicate that: 1) linear probing is frequently insufficient; 2) specialist models trained from scratch remain competitive across many tasks; and, 3) larger foundation models do not necessarily yield better generalization performance under current data regimes and training practices. The code will be available on GitHub1.

I. INTRODUCTION

Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) establish a direct communication pathway between neural activities and external devices by decoding various brain signals [1]. They can be diagnostic and therapeutic tools for a wide range of neurological and psychiatric diseases, e.g., epilepsy [2], disorder of consciousness [3], and mood disorders [4], and can support communications and interactions for individuals with severe motor or speech impairments [5] caused by amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, brainstem stroke, high level spinal cord injury, etc.

BCI systems are commonly categorized into invasive, noninvasive, and partially-invasive ones. This paper focuses on non-invasive BCIs, which do not require implanting sensors inside the brain. Electroencephalogram (EEG), collected by electrodes placed on the scalp of the subject, is the most widely used input in non-invasive BCIs [6].

Classical EEG-based BCI paradigms include motor imagery (MI), steady state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP), event related potentials (ERP), epilepsy recognition, and so on. Recent years have witnessed some emerging paradigms that target higher level cognitive states, such as mental workload [7] and imagined speech [8], [9]. Together, these developments underscore the potential of EEG as a versatile interface to cognitive and neural processes.

Deep learning has driven substantial progress in EEG decoding over the past decade. Convolutional neural networks [10], recurrent neural networks [11], and more recently Transformer-based architectures [12], have been adapted to model the complex spatiotemporal structure of multichannel EEG signals. These methods often outperform classical pipelines that rely on handcrafted features.

Despite these advances, real-world deployment of deep learning models remains challenging. First, most approaches require large amounts of labeled data, whereas EEG acquisition and expert annotation are costly and time consuming. Second, EEG devices differ widely in channel counts and electrode layouts, and conventional architectures often fail to accommodate heterogeneous inputs [13], [14]. Third, many existing models are trained for a single task with limited capacity and limited transferability, which restricts their generalization to new BCI paradigms.

Built on recent progresses on large language models [15] and vision foundation models [16], EEG foundation models [17], as illustrated in Fig. 1, have emerged as a promising direction for addressing these challenges. The core premise is that a model pre-trained on large-scale heterogeneous EEG data can learn general-purpose representations that transfer effectively to diverse downstream tasks with minimal taskspecific adaptation. This paradigm offers a principled solution to the data scarcity problem, as self-supervised pre-training can leverage vast amounts of unlabeled recordings that would otherwise remain unutilized. Furthermore, foundation models can be designed to accommodate diverse electrode configurations, enabling a single pre-trained model to generalize across heterogeneous devices.

Numerous EEG foundation models were proposed in the past two years, with diverse pre-training objectives, architec-

tures, and target applications. Some models focus on generalpurpose representation learning across multiple paradigms, whereas others on specific clinical or cognitive applications. Pre-training strategies range from masked signal reconstruction and contrastive learning to codebook-based discrete modeling and autoregressive sequence prediction. Architecturally, these models have evolved from Transformer-based encoders to Mamba-based designs that offer improved efficiency for long sequences. The scale of pre-training data has also increased substantially, with some recent models leveraging thousands of hours of EEG recordings from dozens of public datasets.

Unfortunately, different studies evaluated their proposed models on different datasets using inconsistent protocols, making direct comparison difficult. Moreover, several fundamental questions regarding the capabilities and limitations of these models have not been rigorously examined. These considerations motivate the following three research questions in this paper:

- Q1. Can EEG foundation models extract generalizable EEG representations, so that they can be easily adapted to various different downstream tasks?
- Q2. Do EEG foundation models consistently and significantly outperform traditional and deep learning methods trained from scratch using only the fine-tuning data?
- Q3. Does the scaling law principle hold for EEG foundation models? Specifically, do larger model sizes and greater volumes of pre-training data lead to better generalization performance on downstream BCI tasks?

Our main contributions are: A comprehensive overview of existing BCI foundation models.

- • We survey 50 BCI foundation models, constituting the most comprehensive collection to date.
- • We provide a detailed and structured comparison of their

technical designs, encompassing basic information, pretraining data scale, preprocessing pipelines, pre-training strategies, and architectural choices.

• We propose a unified taxonomic framework for EEG foundation models that organizes existing work into a coherent design space.

Fair and comprehensive benchmarking for open source EEG foundation models.

- • We systematically compare “full parameter fine-tuning” with “classification head fine-tuning” across various models and tasks to assess whether pre-trained encoders provide broadly transferable EEG representations. Beyond the commonly used leave one subject out (LOSO) scenario, we introduce a within-subject few-shot adaptation scenario in which the fine-tuning data volume is approximately 1/20 ∼ 1/100 of that typically used in LOSO protocols.
- • We comprehensively compare traditional machine learning methods, CNN-based models, and Transformer-based models trained from scratch against fine-tuned EEG foundation models to evaluate whether conventional approaches remain competitive.
- • We evaluate EEG foundation models of varying parameter sizes pre-trained on diverse datasets to investigate whether a larger model necessarily leads to better generalization performance.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section II reviews 50 different BCI foundation models. Section III presents the benchmark. Section IV discusses the limitations and open problems. Section V draws conclusions.

II. OVERVIEW OF EXISTING BCI FOUNDATION MODELS

This section introduces the conceptual framework of BCI foundation models, provides a comprehensive summary of existing approaches, and organizes prevalent pre-training strategies into a unified taxonomic framework, as shown in Fig. 2.

A. Advances and Trends of BCI Foundation Models

Fig. 3 presents overviews of 50 existing BCI foundation models. As shown in Fig. 3(a), 18.0% of the surveyed studies were published in 2024 and 64.0% in 2025 or 2026, indicating a clear surge in research activity. This accelerated progress is accompanied by increasing diversity in model scope, signal modalities, backbone architectures, and training methodologies. Table I summarizes the 50 surveyed models in chronological order, reporting the affiliation of the first author, publication date, targeted modality, pre-training data scale, computational cost, and parameter size (bold represents open source).

Model scope has begun to bifurcate. As shown in Fig. 3(b), while most studies aim to develop generalized EEG foundation models, a nontrivial subset focuses on paradigm-specific foundation models. In practical BCI deployment, the target paradigm is often known prior to downstream data collection. Motivated by this observation, paradigm-specific models are pre-trained exclusively on data from a single paradigm to

prioritize domain-aligned representation learning, potentially at the expense of cross-paradigm generalizability.

The distribution of signal modalities further reflects this diversity. Fig. 3(c) shows that non-invasive scalp EEG remains the dominant modality, largely because it does not require surgical implantation and is substantially easier to collect at scale than invasive recordings. However, scalp EEG signals are attenuated and spatially blurred due to volume conduction through the scalp and skull, which limits both signal strength and spatial resolution [68]. To improve robustness and enrich the supervisory signal, several studies incorporate auxiliary physiological modalities such as electrocardiogram (ECG) [21], electromyogram (EMG) [30], or magnetoencephalography (MEG) [42], suggesting that representation learning can benefit from correlated biosignals.

From an architectural perspective, Fig. 3(d) indicates that Transformer-based backbones dominate current EEG foundation models. Model capacity and training resources, however, exhibit substantial variability rather than a monotonic scaling trend. Fig. 3(e) reveals a wide distribution of parameter scales, and Table I confirms that model sizes range from fewer than one million parameters to several billion parameters.

In summary, BCI foundation models have entered a phase of rapid exploration characterized by diverse model scopes, modalities, architectures, and pre-training strategies. However, existing models employed heterogeneous pre-training objectives and were evaluated under diverse downstream scenarios and fine-tuning protocols, which complicates the derivation of consistent conclusions on the factors that truly drive generalization. This observation motivates the unified framework illustrated in Fig. 2, which standardizes the major design axes of EEG foundation models. The need for systematic comparison further calls for a comprehensive benchmark, which is presented in Section III.

B. Definition of BCI Foundation Models

EEG foundation models aim to learn transferable and generalizable neural representations from large scale EEG data. In contrast to conventional BCI pipelines that are optimized for a single task and dataset, often through hand crafted features and supervised training from scratch, BCI foundation models are typically pre-trained on heterogeneous EEG data collected under different devices and paradigms. After pretraining, they can be adapted to downstream BCI tasks using fine-tuning or prompting, with the expectation of improved generalization and reduced dependence on task specific labels. Due to their versatility, foundation models have become a prominent research direction in the BCI community.

A commonly used definition of an AI foundation model is [69]:

Definition 2.1 (Foundation Model): A foundation model is any model that is trained on broad data and can be adapted to a wide range of downstream tasks.

While this definition captures the essence of general purpose foundation models, the design of EEG foundation models exhibits several domain-specific characteristics:

(1) BCI-FMs are pre-trained on large scale EEG data, including both scalp EEG and intracranial EEG (iEEG).

Additionally, other physiological signals such as electrocardiogram (ECG) and electromyogram (EMG) may serve as auxiliary data during pre-training.

- (2) General-purpose foundation models are expected to handle highly heterogeneous downstream tasks, such as semantic segmentation, object detection, long form question answering, and video generation [70]. In contrast, current EEG foundation models primarily target classification tasks across various electrode configurations and BCI paradigms.
- (3) EEG data acquisition is resource-intensive, requiring participant recruitment, paradigm design, and stringent environmental control. As a result, EEG corpora are typically smaller than text or image corpora, and current EEG foundation models are often trained with considerably fewer parameters and lower computational budgets.

Based on these domain specific considerations, we propose the following definition for BCI foundation models:

Definition 2.2 (BCI Foundation Model): A BCI foundation model is pre-trained on large scale electrophysiological data, and can be adapted through fine-tuning or prompting to heterogeneous EEG devices and downstream BCI tasks (categories).

C. Problem Definition

Assume the pre-training corpus be Dpre = {D(m)}Mm=1, where D(m) = {Xi(m)}N

i=1, M is the number of datasets and Nm is the number of trials in dataset m. Each raw trial is a multi-channel time series Xi(m) ∈ RC

m

m×Tm, where Cm is the channel count and Tm is the number of sampled time points.

Let the downstream task be T = {τj}Jj=1, where each task τj specifies a paradigm, a device configuration, and a label space of size Cj. For each task τj, we define a labeled dataset:

D(τj) = Dtask(j) = {(Xk(j),yk(j))}Nk=1j , Xk(j) ∈ RC

j×Tj,yk(j) ∈ {1,2,...,Cj}. (1)

We further denote the corpus of all downstream task datasets as

Ddown = {Dtask(j) }Jj=1. (2)

A BCI foundation model is expected to be pre-trained on Dpre and then adapted to each downstream task in T . Let fΘ denote a pre-trained model with parameters Θ, which maps an input trial to a predictive distribution over Cj classes for task τj. The pre-training stage estimates

For each downstream task τj, we split its labeled dataset into a fine-tuning set and a test set:

with Dft(j) = {(Xk(j),yk(j))}nk=1j , Dte(j) = {(Xk(j),yk(j))}Nk=jnj+1.

We expect a BCI pre-trained model could achieve strong generalization performance on Dte(j) after fine-tuning on Dft(j).

1) Data Collection and Curation: Constructing EEG foundation models begins with data collection, where the primary sources include public datasets and self-collected recordings. Fig. 4 presents the frequency of dataset usage in pre-training and downstream evaluation across existing EEG foundation models. Most existing approaches aim to develop generalpurpose models that accommodate various paradigms, and therefore aggregate large volumes of unlabeled data spanning diverse tasks for pre-training.

However, directly collected EEG data often exhibit inconsistent quality, including recordings from poor-performing subjects, corrupted channels, and various artifacts. Curating a large-scale, high-quality dataset is therefore critical for effective foundation model training [35], [71]. Common curation strategies include subject-level screening to exclude participants with abnormally low task performance or excessive noise, and channel-level screening to remove channels exhibiting persistent artifacts or disconnections. Filtering out such noisy data facilitates more stable optimization and improves the quality of learned representations.

2) Data Preprocessing: EEG signals exhibit substantial variability across subjects and devices. Variations in electrode placement, impedance, environmental noise, and physiological state can induce considerable distribution shifts, which may impair large scale pre-training and downstream transfer. Therefore, BCI foundation model pipelines incorporate preprocessing and normalization to reduce nuisance variability and stabilize optimization, the specific information is shown in Table II.

To maintain notational consistency throughout this section, we denote a raw trial by X ∈ RC×T and use the symbol X for the model input after preprocessing. Specifically, we define a preprocessing operator

## X = G(X), (5)

where G represents a specific alignment or normalization strategy.

Channel Unification. EEG signals exhibit substantial spatial heterogeneity, as different devices adopt varying electrode layouts and channel counts. This heterogeneity makes it diffi-

cult to directly reuse conventional task-specific models across datasets. In contrast, many Transformer-based backbones can process variable-length token sequences, which has enabled a broader set of strategies to accommodate heterogeneous channel configurations. Among the surveyed EEG foundation models, the prevailing solutions can be categorized as follows.

- (1) Common montage pre-training. A straightforward strategy is to restrict pre-training to datasets that share a common set of channels, typically using a fixed montage with a standardized channel count, and subsequently transfer to downstream tasks within the same montage family.
- (2) Template-based channel mapping. Another line of work defines a channel-level or region-level template. Channels present in the recording that match the template are retained directly, while missing channels are mapped into the template space through interpolation or related mapping functions.
- (3) Spatial encoding for channel structure. Since simple channel selection does not explicitly model spatial relationships, several models augment the input with channel position encodings. Both fixed spatial encodings derived from electrode coordinates and learnable channel embeddings have been employed to inject spatial inductive bias.
- (4) Channel projection to a unified space. Some pipelines predefine a target channel space and incorporate an input projection module, often implemented as convolutional layers, to map the raw channels into this unified space before the Transformer backbone. This strategy explicitly learns a dataset-agnostic channel transformation and can be combined with tokenization.

Resampling and bandpass filtering. Resampling and filtering are widely adopted to standardize temporal resolution and suppress nuisance components in EEG signals. Fig. 3(f) summarizes the resampling choices across the surveyed studies. Specifically, 50.0% of the studies resample signals to 200 Hz, while 34.1% resample to 250 Hz or 256 Hz. Bandpass filtering is commonly applied to attenuate slow drifts and high-frequency noise, and notch filters at 50 Hz or 60 Hz are frequently employed to reduce power-line interference. Model-specific resampling and filtering configurations are

summarized in Table II.

Normalization and Marginal Alignment. Below we describe several widely adopted normalization or data alignment approaches used in preprocessing.

- (1) z-score Normalization. z-score normalization rescales each channel to zero-mean and unit variance, ensuring comparable magnitude across channels. This technique is widely employed in the preprocessing stage of BCI foundation models. For a trial X, the channel-wise statistics are defined as

µc =

1 T

T

t=1

Xc,t, σc =

1 T

T

t=1

(Xc,t − µc)2 + ϵ,

(6) and the normalized signal is given by

Gz(X)c,t =

Xc,t − µc σc

, (7)

where ϵ > 0 is a small constant for numerical stability. Depending on the protocol, the statistics can be computed per trial, per session, or over the entire training set. Representative foundation models that adopt z-score normalization include BrainBERT [19], Neuro-GPT [25], Brant-X [30], EEGPT [32], BrainGPT [33], LEAD [37], ALFEE [41], BrainOmni [42], UniMind [45], EpilepsyFM [53], BioCodec [58], REVE [61], and LUNA [63].

- (2) Common Average Reference (CAR). Another standard preprocessing technique is CAR, which suppresses com-

mon mode activity shared across all channels. Let 1C ∈ RC denote an all-ones vector. CAR transforms X as follows:

Gcar(X) = X −

1 C

1C1⊤CX. (8)

The underlying assumption of CAR is that signals recorded at all electrodes contain a common noise component, such as reference electrode drift or environmental interference. By subtracting the instantaneous average across all electrodes from each individual electrode, CAR effectively attenuates this common mode component while preserving spatially localized neural activity. Representative foundation models employing CAR include EEGPT [32], E3GT [43], HEAR [59], and mdJPT [62].

- (3) Euclidean Alignment (EA). EA [72], [73] performs subject-wise or session-wise whitening to reduce covariance shifts and improve cross-subject consistency.

Assume a subject contains n trials {Xi}ni=1, where each Xi ∈ RC×T. EA first computes the mean covariance matrix as

n

1 n

R¯ =

XiXi⊤, (9)

i=1

and then applies the whitening transformation

Gea(Xi) = R¯−1/2Xi. (10)

After this transformation, the mean covariance of the aligned trials becomes the identity matrix, thereby reducing discrepancies in second-order statistics across subjects. Representative foundation models adopting EA include EEGPT [32] and MIRepNet [49].

- (4) Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Normalization. To handle gradual drift in long recordings, some approaches adopt exponential moving average normalization, in which normalization statistics are updated sequentially.

Let xt ∈ RC denote the multichannel sample at time t. EMA maintains exponentially decaying estimates of the first and second moments as follows:

mt = αmt−1 + (1 − α)xt, (11)

st = αst−1 + (1 − α)xt ⊙ xt, (12) where α ∈ (0,1) is the decay factor and ⊙ denotes the element-wise product. The variance estimate is given by vt = st − mt ⊙ mt, and the normalized sample is computed as

Gema(x)t =

xt − mt √vt + ϵ

. (13)

EMA normalization is particularly suitable for online or streaming settings, as it does not require precomputed global statistics and can adapt to non-stationarities in the signal. A representative foundation model employing EMA normalization is FoME [31].

- (5) Summary. z-score normalization, CAR, and EMA normalization are widely adopted as generic preprocessing components, whereas EA provides an explicit mechanism to reduce session-level covariance shifts. In practice, G can be instantiated as a composition of these operations. For notational simplicity, we use the unified notation X = G(X) to denote the preprocessed model input throughout the remainder of this section.

3) Model Pre-training: Most EEG foundation models are pre-trained with self-supervised objectives that remove or corrupt part of the input and require the model to recover the masked information. Table III summarizes the pre-training strategies of 50 foundation models, and Fig. 3 highlights eight empirical trends across these models. Several insights can be drawn from this analysis. First, Transformer-based backbone is adopted by approximately 82.0% of the models. Second, masked reconstruction constitutes the dominant pre-training paradigm. Among masking strategies, random masking is the most prevalent choice, accounting for approximately 70.8%, while causal masking and mixed masking together occupy a smaller portion. Third, regarding reconstruction targets, raw signal reconstruction is the most frequent strategy, accounting for approximately 24.0%, while token reconstruction and hybrid approaches that combine raw and token reconstruction together constitute a comparable fraction. Codebook-based objectives and frequency-domain objectives appear less frequently as standalone targets, but they are often employed as auxiliary supervision in multi-target designs. Based on these observations, we organize the mainstream pre-training strategies into five categories: masked reconstruction of raw signals, masked reconstruction of embedded tokens, frequency-domain

reconstruction, codebook-based objectives, and autoregressive pre-training.

Given a raw EEG trial X ∈ RC×T, we denote the model input after preprocessing by X = G(X). Since EEG is typically sampled at high temporal resolution, most EEG foundation models further aggregate time steps into patches to reduce sequence length and capture local temporal structure. Let the patch length be M and the stride be S, with overlap O = M − S. We segment X along the temporal axis into Np

patches, where

Np =

T − M S

+ 1, (14)

and denote the resulting patch tensor by

p×C×M, (15)

P = S( X) ∈ RN

where S denotes the patching operator. The k-th patch of channel c is denoted by pk,c ∈ RM.

a) Masked Reconstruction of Raw Signals: Raw signal reconstruction is the most prevalent pre-training strategy, employed by representative models such as Brant, FoME, CBraMod, CSBrain, EEGMamba, BrainPro, REVE, and EEGX.

For mask-based reconstruction pre-training, masking is applied directly to the patched raw signal:

## Pmsk = Mx(P), (16)

and the encoder consumes the masked patches. The model learns to reconstruct the original patches using the canonical mean squared error loss:

X = Dϕ Eθ(Pmsk) , Lrsmse = X − X 22. (17) This approach is intuitive because it directly constrains the encoder to preserve waveform structure and cross-channel dependencies, which are critical for event-related components and oscillatory bursts. However, non-invasive EEG typically exhibits a low signal-to-noise ratio and contains substantial nuisance variability arising from artifacts, impedance fluctuations, and background activity. When the pre-training target is the waveform itself, a model with sufficient capacity may devote representation power to reconstructing idiosyncratic noise patterns that are not predictive for downstream tasks and the risk is amplified when the masking ratio is inappropriate.

Several works have therefore attempted to modify Lrsmse to improve robustness. For example, FEMBA employs the smooth ℓ1 loss Lrss-l1, BrainPro uses a weighted variant Lrsw-mse together with a decomposition loss Ldec, and REVE incorporates an auxiliary loss Laux. EEG-X further emphasizes denoising by reconstructing noise-removed signals via Lnrsmse and incorporates teacher-student distillation Lteakd -stu, which aligns with the practical need to suppress artifacts rather than reproduce them. Overall, raw signal reconstruction serves as a strong baseline when data quality is controlled and masking is sufficiently challenging, but it benefits from explicit regularization that discourages memorization of noise.

b) Masked Reconstruction of Embedded Tokens: Token reconstruction is conceptually similar to raw signal reconstruction, but operates in a learned embedding space. In this approach, EEG signals are first passed through a neural tokenizer or patch embedding module, typically implemented as a CNN, to obtain embedded tokens, and the model is trained to reconstruct these representations. This strategy is adopted by models such as BENDR, BIOT, GEFM, CEReBrO, LUNA, ELASTIQ, and MIRepNet.

For token-based pre-training, each patch is mapped into an embedding through a tokenizer:

p×d, (18)

Z = Tψ(P), Z ∈ RN

where d denotes the embedding dimension. Masking is then applied in the token space:

Zmsk = Mz(Z). (19) The model learns to predict the original token embeddings:

Z = Dϕ Eθ(Zmsk) , Letmse = Z − Z 22, (20)

or alternatively employs a contrastive learning objective in the embedding space, denoted by Letcl and related terms in Table III.

Compared to raw signal reconstruction, token-level objectives aim to reduce sensitivity to amplitude scaling and local waveform noise, as the tokenizer compresses the input into a representation that can be designed to emphasize spatiotemporal structure. This design often improves optimization stability for large encoders and naturally supports patch-based processing, which is consistent with the high prevalence of patching observed in Fig. 3.

However, the learned representation inherits the inductive bias of the tokenizer. If tokenization is too coarse, fine-grained transient features may be lost. Conversely, if tokenization is too shallow, the objective may degenerate into reconstruction of near-identity embeddings. Several models address this tension by combining token-level objectives with auxiliary terms. CEReBrO incorporates Laux to enrich the learning signal. LCM combines contrastive learning Lembcl with a weighted reconstruction term λLetmse. MIRepNet integrates Letmse with a classification loss Lcls to bias the representation toward discriminative structure relevant to its target paradigm. These examples suggest that token reconstruction often benefits from complementary objectives that encourage global semantic learning rather than pure local reconstruction.

c) Frequency-Domain Reconstruction: This family of methods defines the reconstruction target in the spectral domain to emphasize oscillatory structure. Following the unified notation, let X = G(X) denote the preprocessed trial and P = S( X) ∈ RN

p×C×M denote the patched signal. We introduce a spectral transform operator F that maps P to a frequency-domain representation:

## S = F(P). (21)

Depending on the choice of F, S may represent a spectrogram, spectral amplitude, band power, or an amplitude-phase decomposition. A pre-trained model predicts S from masked inputs and minimizes a spectral reconstruction loss.

Spectrogram reconstruction. Let Fspec denote a timefrequency transform, and define

Sspec = Fspec(P). (22) A decoder predicts Sspec and optimizes

Lspecmse = Sspec − Sspec 22. (23) This objective is adopted by BrainBERT and BrainWave.

Spectral amplitude reconstruction. Let Famp extract spectral amplitude, yielding

Samp = Famp(P). (24) The corresponding objective is

Lampmse = Samp − Samp 22, (25) which is employed by EEGFormer. Some approaches additionally align predictions with codebook-related embeddings through

## Lcbmse = Ecb − Ecb 22, (26)

where Ecb denotes the selected codebook embeddings and Ecb denotes the corresponding predictions.

Band power reconstruction. Let Fbp compute band power features, yielding

Sbp = Fbp(P). (27) The reconstruction objective is

Lbpmse = Sbp − Sbp 22, (28) which is employed by Uni-NTFM as a frequency-domain supervision signal.

Amplitude-phase reconstruction. HEAR supervises a compact Fourier representation of each temporal patch. Let P denote an EEG patch and Ffour its frequency-domain transform:

Sfour = Ffour(P), Sfour = Ffour( P). (29) For models that jointly supervise amplitude and phase, we decompose Sfour = {A(i,j),ψ(i,j)}, where A(i,j) and ψ(i,j) denote the ground-truth amplitude and phase of patch (i,j), respectively. Similarly, Sfour = { A(i,j), ψ(i,j)} represents the reconstructed counterparts. The frequency loss employed by HEAR is formulated as

CiTi/w

n

A(i,j) − A(i,j) 22 + ψ(i,j) − ψ(i,j) 22 ,

Lfourmse =

i=1

j=1

(30) where Ci denotes the number of channels, Ti denotes the number of time points, and w denotes the patch length. Both terms employ squared ℓ2 norms, penalizing amplitude and phase discrepancies equally.

Multi-scale spectral reconstruction. BioCodec employs a richer spectral loss based on short-time Fourier transforms (STFT) computed at multiple scales. The composite spectral feature at scale i is defined as:

## Φi(x) = log |Si(x)|, cos ∠Si(x) , sin ∠Si(x) , (31)

where Si(·) denotes the STFT with window length 2i, and x and x represent the original and reconstructed waveforms, respectively. The log-magnitude and phase components are weighted as [1.0,0.2,0.2], respectively. The two frequency losses reported in Table III are:

- Lstftℓ1 =

nh

i=nl

Φi(x) − Φi( x) 1, (32)

- Lstftℓ2 =

nh

Φi(x) − Φi( x) 22, (33)

i=nl

where nl and nh define the lower and upper bounds of the scale set. The ℓ1 loss encourages sparsity, while the ℓ2 loss penalizes large spectral deviations.

The motivation for frequency-domain reconstruction is neurophysiological. Many BCI paradigms are characterized by rhythmic modulations in specific frequency bands, and spectral supervision emphasizes oscillatory regularities that are comparatively robust to amplitude scaling and certain artifacts. This property can mitigate the tendency of raw waveform regression to memorize recording-specific noise, which is a

practical concern for non-invasive EEG with low signal-tonoise ratio. The limitation is that the chosen transform F may underrepresent transient dynamics or phase information, depending on the specific representation employed. Consequently, frequency-domain reconstruction is often adopted as the primary objective when rhythmic structure dominates the signal of interest, or combined with a time-domain target within the same model. For example, Mentality and SAMBA jointly optimize raw signal and frequency-domain supervision to capture complementary temporal and spectral characteristics.

d) Codebook-Based Objectives: Codebook-based pretraining introduces discrete units that can be predicted as indices or reconstructed as codebook embeddings. Models such as LaBraM, BrainOmni, CodeBrain, EpilepsyFM, NeuroRVQ, NeuroLM, and THD-BAR adopt codebook index supervision, as reflected in Table I. Let a quantizer map embeddings to discrete indices:

## I = Q(Z), I ∈ {1,2,...,K}L, (34)

where K denotes the codebook size and L denotes the sequence length. A common formulation predicts an index distribution P ∈ [0,1]L×K and optimizes a cross-entropy loss:

L

Lcicls =

Lce Iℓ, Pℓ . (35)

ℓ=1

Autoregressive index modeling employs negative loglikelihood objectives such as Lcinll, which is adopted by NeuroLM and THD-BAR. An alternative branch aligns predicted embeddings with codebook embeddings, represented by Lcemse or related terms, as employed by HEAR.

The primary advantage of codebook-based objectives is that discretization can suppress low-amplitude noise and provides a compact symbolic sequence that is compatible with largescale sequence modeling. This design also facilitates causal generation and prompt-based adaptation when combined with decoder-only architectures. However, codebook learning introduces additional design considerations, including codebook size, commitment regularization, and update schedules. If not carefully controlled, the codebook can collapse or exhibit highly imbalanced usage, which undermines representation quality. Several surveyed models mitigate these issues through carefully designed quantizers or by decoupling codebook learning from masked modeling, though this generally increases training complexity and implementation overhead.

e) Autoregressive Pre-training: Autoregressive pretraining enforces causal factorization and is instantiated by models such as Neuro-GPT, BrainGPT, NeuroLM, and THDBAR. Notably, NeuroLM and THD-BAR additionally pre-train a codebook to facilitate reconstruction. For token sequences, the objective can be formulated as

L

log pΘ Zℓ | Z1:ℓ−1 , Z = Tψ( X),

arg max

Θ

ℓ=1

X∈Dpre

(36) while for codebook indices it naturally corresponds to likelihood-based objectives such as Lcinll.

Autoregressive modeling is appealing because it aligns with decoder-only Transformer architectures and supports sequence continuation and prompting. It also provides a principled framework for modeling temporal dynamics. However, strictly causal objectives can be more challenging to optimize than bidirectional masked reconstruction, particularly when tokens are high-dimensional or when the temporal discretization is not well matched to EEG dynamics. Furthermore, causal objectives may emphasize short-range predictability, which can bias the representation toward local continuity rather than task-relevant global structure, unless the model architecture and context length are sufficiently expressive.

f) Hybrid Objectives and Practical Selection: Several models adopt hybrid designs that combine two or more complementary targets. Examples include Mentality, which combines Lrsmse and Lspecmse ; EEGPT, which combines Lrsmse with an embedding reconstruction term Lembmse; DMAE-EEG, which combines Lrsmse and Letmse; and SAMBA, which combines timedomain and frequency-domain reconstruction. These hybrid formulations should be interpreted as deliberate design choices to constrain the representation from complementary perspectives, rather than an indiscriminate aggregation of all available losses.

In practice, the appropriate pre-training objective depends on the intended deployment setting. When cross-dataset heterogeneity and low signal-to-noise ratio are the dominant challenges, token-level and codebook-based objectives often provide stronger invariances than raw waveform regression. When rhythmic structure is central to the target paradigm, frequency-domain supervision can be beneficial, particularly when paired with a time-domain constraint. When promptbased adaptation or causal generation is required, autoregressive objectives become a natural choice, although they may require careful tokenization and context design to avoid overly local predictions.

g) Summary: Existing EEG foundation models largely adhere to a masked prediction paradigm, but differ substantially in their target space and implied inductive biases. Table I summarizes these design choices through the reconstruction objective and loss function columns, encompassing Lrawmse and its robust variants, Ltokmse and Ltokcl , spectral losses such as Lspecmse and Lampmse , codebook index losses such as Lcicls and Lcinll, as well as additional auxiliary terms that refine the learning signal. This taxonomy provides a consistent framework for comparing pre-training strategies under heterogeneous EEG settings and clarifies why different approaches may be preferable for specific BCI paradigms and deployment constraints. Detailed experimental analysis is presented in the following section.

4) Downstream Generalization: After pre-training on largescale EEG corpora, downstream evaluation is required to assess whether the learned representations transfer effectively to practical BCI tasks. Fig. 4 (b) summarizes the most frequently used downstream datasets. These datasets span multiple representative paradigms. For example, TUAB, TUEV, and CHBMIT are clinical EEG datasets; BCIC-IV-2A and PhysioNetMI are motor imagery datasets; FACED, SEED, and SEED-V are emotion recognition datasets; and Sleep-EDF is a sleeprelated dataset. This distribution indicates that downstream

evaluation in existing work is largely concentrated on clinical applications, motor imagery, affective decoding, and sleep analysis.

Following the problem definition in Section II-C, each downstream task τj is associated with a dataset Dtask(j) , which is partitioned into a fine-tuning set Dft(j) and a held-out test set Dte(j). Given a pre-trained model fΘ⋆, task-specific fine-tuning estimates

L(clsj) y,fΘ(X) , (37)

Θ⋆j = arg min

Θ

(X,y)∈Dft(j)

where L(clsj) denotes a supervised loss for task τj. The finetuned model fΘ⋆

is then evaluated on the held-out test set. Taking classification accuracy as an example, the evaluation is formulated as follows:

j

, (38)

## (X)

y = arg max

fΘ⋆

j

c∈{1,2,...,Cj}

c

1 |Dte(j)| (X,y)∈D(j)

## 1( y = y), (39)

Acc(τj) =

te

where 1(·) denotes the indicator function.

Regarding evaluation scenarios, most existing studies adopt a leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) setting or perform subjectdisjoint splits into training, validation, and test sets. Such protocols are valuable for assessing cross-subject generalization, as the test subject remains unseen during fine-tuning. However, these protocols typically require a substantial amount of labeled data from the same device and paradigm for fine-tuning, since data from multiple training subjects are aggregated for adaptation. This requirement can be restrictive in practical deployment scenarios where only limited calibration data may be available for a new user.

In principle, a foundation model is expected to reduce dependence on task-matched labeled data and enable effective adaptation with minimal calibration. This motivates the need for a more comprehensive evaluation suite that encompasses both data-rich cross-subject transfer and data-limited calibration regimes under consistent protocols. Section III presents our benchmark design, which is constructed to address these complementary requirements.

III. BENCHMARK OF BCI FOUNDATION MODELS

This section presents a comprehensive benchmark for EEG foundation models. We evaluate 12 open-source foundation models and 7 traditional baselines, including conventional machine learning and deep learning methods, on 13 datasets spanning 9 representative BCI paradigms. To assess model generalization under realistic deployment constraints, we design a set of comprehensive and fair evaluation scenarios.

imagery, emotion recognition, and sleep staging emerge as the dominant evaluation paradigms. However, this concentration on a limited set of paradigms may not fully reflect the generalization capability of foundation models across diverse BCI applications. To address this limitation, we select 13 datasets spanning 9 paradigms for downstream evaluation, providing broader coverage of representative BCI scenarios. The dataset characteristics are summarized in Table IV, with detailed descriptions provided in Appendix B.

B. Evaluation Scenarios

Most existing EEG foundation model studies evaluated downstream transfer under a leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) scenario or subject-disjoint splits into training, validation, and test sets. While this setting is widely adopted, it remains unclear whether it provides a comprehensive assessment of foundation model generalization and whether it aligns with practical deployment requirements.

a) LOSO Scenario: The LOSO scenario evaluates crosssubject generalization within the same task and headset configuration. Concretely, a model is fine-tuned using labeled data from a subset of subjects recorded with the same EEG

device and paradigm, and is subsequently evaluated on heldout subjects. The primary advantage of LOSO is that the target subject is evaluated in a zero-calibration manner, as no labeled data from the test subject are used during finetuning. However, LOSO has two important limitations. First, it typically requires a substantial amount of labeled data from multiple subjects, which increases the fine-tuning cost. Second, it implicitly assumes the availability of a corpus collected with the same device configuration and task as the target deployment setting, which may not hold in practice, particularly for new devices or customized paradigms.

In our benchmark, LOSO fine-tuning followed the common practice of using all available trials from the finetuning subjects for most datasets. However, for the MI and P300 datasets (BNCI2014001, BNCI2014004, BNCI2015001, BNCI2014009, and BNCI2014008), we used only a single session from each subject for fine-tuning. For CHB-MIT, we used the ictal segments together with the 10-minute pre-ictal segments of each seizure for model adaptation and evaluation. For TUAB, we used the first 3 minutes of each recording as input segments. For Things-EEG2, we used three out of ten images per class. For Sleep-EDFx and TUAB, which contain a large number of subjects, we adopted a ten-fold subject split, where subjects were evenly partitioned into ten folds for crossvalidation.

b) Within-Subject Few-Shot Scenario: To better reflect deployment settings where only limited calibration data are available for a new user, we designed a within-subject fewshot evaluation protocol. In this setting, the model was finetuned using a small labeled subset from the target subject and evaluated on the remaining data of the same subject. The within-subject scenario offers two advantages. First, it substantially reduces the amount of fine-tuning data and lowers the adaptation cost. Second, it does not require an external training corpus that matches the target device and paradigm, thereby supporting rapid personalization for new devices, tasks, and users. The primary limitation is that it requires collecting labeled calibration data from the target user during deployment, which may be inconvenient in certain applications.

Specifically, for the MI datasets (BNCI2014001, BNCI2014004, and BNCI2015001), we fine-tuned using 30% of one session from the target subject, with fewer than 30 trials per class. For P300 datasets, we fine-tuned using 10% of one session for BNCI2014009 and 5% of one session for BNCI2014008. For CHB-MIT, we fine-tuned using the first seizure’s ictal segments from the target subject together with its 10-minute pre-ictal segment, and evaluated on the remaining seizures’ ictal segments with their corresponding pre-ictal segments. For Sleep-EDFx, we used 10% of the target subject’s data for fine-tuning. For SEED, we used one video per class for fine-tuning. For Nakanishi2015 and EEGMat, we fine-tuned using 80% and 60% of the target subject’s data, respectively. For Things-EEG2, we used three out of ten images per class for each subject. For SEED-VIG, we fine-tuned using 10% of the data from a single subject. We did not include a within-subject few-shot setting for TUAB, as each subject is associated with a fixed diagnostic

label (normal or abnormal).

- c) Fine-Tuning Strategies: For both LOSO and withinsubject few-shot scenarios, we compared two fine-tuning strategies to assess the quality of pre-trained representations. The first strategy, full-parameter fine-tuning, updated all model parameters during fine-tuning, allowing the entire network to be optimized for the downstream task. The second strategy, linear probing, froze the pre-trained encoder and trained only the classification head, which directly evaluated the transferability of the learned representations without task-specific feature adaptation. By comparing these two strategies, we aimed to disentangle the contributions of pre-trained representations from those of end-to-end fine-tuning.
- d) Summary: The LOSO and within-subject few-shot protocols evaluate complementary aspects of generalization. LOSO measures cross-subject transfer under a fixed paradigm and device configuration without test-subject calibration, whereas within-subject few-shot evaluates rapid personalization with limited calibration data. Furthermore, the comparison between full-parameter fine-tuning and linear probing provides insights into the quality and transferability of pre-trained representations. By reporting results under both scenarios with both fine-tuning strategies, our benchmark provides a more comprehensive assessment of EEG foundation model generalization and better reflects practical deployment constraints.

C. Evaluated Approaches

In this benchmark, we compared traditional machine learning baselines, 6 deep learning models (including 3 CNN-based and 3 Transformer-based architectures), and 12 EEG foundation models. The following provides a detailed description of each category.

- a) Traditional Machine Learning Baselines.: For each

dataset, we selected a paradigm-specific traditional machine learning algorithm as the baseline, which remains competitive against deep learning methods in the respective domain. CSP+LDA (linear discriminant analysis) [74] was used for BNCI2014001, BNCI2014004, BNCI2015001, TUAB, SEED, and EEGMat. xDAWN+LDA [75] was employed for the P300 datasets BNCI2014009 and BNCI2014008. PSD+SVM (Power Spectral Density with Support Vector Machine) [76] was used for CHB-MIT. PSD+LDA [77] was applied to SleepEDFx. TRCA (task-related component analysis) [78] was used for Nakanishi2015. PSD+Ridge [79] was employed for SEEDVIG.

- b) Deep Learning Baselines: We evaluated six task-

specific deep learning models trained from scratch. For CNNbased architectures, we included EEGNet [10], ShallowConvNet [80], and LMDA-Net [81]. For Transformer-based architectures, we included CNN-Transformer [82], Deformer [83], and Conformer [84]. These models represent widely adopted architectures in the EEG decoding and serve as strong baselines for comparison with foundation models.

- c) EEG Foundation Models: We evaluated all EEG foun-

dation models with publicly available code and pre-trained weights, including BENDR [18], BIOT [21], LaBraM [23], Neuro-GPT [25], EEGPT [32], CBraMod [35], TFM [40],

BrainOmni [42], EEGMamba [48], MIRepNet [49], SingLEM [54], and LUNA [63]. Among these, MIRepNet is a paradigm-specific foundation model designed exclusively for motor imagery tasks, while the remaining 11 models are general-purpose EEG foundation models intended to support multiple BCI paradigms.

D. Main Results

We performed all benchmarking experiments on 24 NVIDIA A800 GPUs and 8 NVIDIA A100 GPUs. All results are averaged over 3 random seeds, and we report the performance on the test set at the final epoch of fine-tuning. The main results are summarized in Tables V and VI. We reported balanced classification accuracy (BCA) as the primary metric for all classification tasks. We adopted 2-way accuracy for the Things-EEG2 dataset and root mean square error (RMSE) for the SEED-VIG regression task. Note that BIOT includes three variants: BIOT-1D, BIOT-2D, and BIOT-6D, which are pre-trained on 1, 2, and 6 datasets, respectively. Tables V and VI report results for BIOT-6D, the variant trained on the largest data scale, while results for BIOT-1D and BIOT-2D are provided in Appendix C. Comprehensive per-subject results are also provided in Appendix C.

1) Can Foundation Models Learn Generalized Representations?: Tables V and VI present the performance of 12 EEG foundation models across 13 downstream datasets. A notable observation was that head-only fine-tuning (linear probing) consistently yielded inferior, and in many cases substantially lower, performance compared to full-parameter fine-tuning for most foundation models. This finding suggested that adapting foundation models to diverse downstream tasks cannot rely solely on features extracted by pre-trained encoders; taskspecific fine-tuning of the encoder parameters remains essential. While several models such as EEGPT exhibited superior head-only performance relative to full fine-tuning, neither adaptation strategy achieved consistently strong results across the benchmark.

Furthermore, EEG foundation models exhibited considerable variability in their task-specific performance. For instance, CBraMod demonstrated competitive results across most tasks, achieving first and second place on the SEED dataset under LOSO and few-shot scenarios, respectively. However, it yielded the highest RMSE among all evaluated methods on SEED-VIG in the LOSO scenario. Similarly, LUNA attained state-of-the-art performance on TUAB but failed to generalize effectively to paradigms beyond clinical applications, a limitation likely attributable to its pre-training exclusively on TUEG and Siena datasets.

An encouraging finding emerged from the Nakanishi2015 dataset, an SSVEP paradigm with extremely limited finetuning data (12 trials per class). Despite this constraint, several foundation models, including BENDR, EEGPT, and Neuro-GPT, achieved strong performance. Since the SSVEP paradigm relies on decoding neural responses to target stimuli flickering at distinct frequencies, the resulting signals exhibit pronounced periodicity and temporal structure. Consequently, the masked reconstruction objectives employed during pre-

training may endow these models with enhanced capability to capture temporal dynamics in EEG signals.

Fig. 6 visualizes the encoder features using t-SNE. We selected Subject 2 from BNCI2014008 and Subject 7 from SEED, both of which exhibited relatively strong performance compared to other subjects in their respective datasets. The visualization revealed that full-parameter fine-tuning yielded more discriminative feature structures than linear probing, with clearer separation between classes in the embedding space.

In summary, pre-trained EEG foundation models demonstrated a capacity to extract transferable representations to a certain extent. However, this generalization capability remained insufficiently robust: the majority of models required full-parameter fine-tuning on downstream tasks and could not directly leverage pre-trained encoders to obtain features for effective decoding. Even the best-performing foundation models in our evaluation exhibited notable performance degradation on specific tasks, indicating that achieving truly universal EEG representations remains an open challenge.

2) Can Foundation Models Consistently Outperform Specialist Models?: With the proliferation of EEG foundation models, whether traditional deep learning methods remain competitive is a question worth investigating. We compared existing foundation models against seven specialist models, including 1 traditional machine learning method, 3 CNN-based methods, and 3 Transformer-based methods. These specialist models were trained from scratch using the same fine-tuning data as the foundation models and evaluated on identical test sets. Fig. 7(a) and (b) present the ranking of each model based on the number of top-1 and top-3 placements across all tasks and scenarios. Notably, EEGNet achieved the highest number of top-1 placements, demonstrating remarkable performance despite having only 2K parameters. ShallowConv obtained the highest number of top-3 placements. Among the top five models in both Fig. 7(a) and (b), four were specialist models. Specifically, EEGNet, Conformer, Traditional ML, and Deformer ranked 1st, 2nd, 4th, and 5th in top-1 counts, respectively, while ShallowConv, EEGNet, Conformer, and Deformer ranked 1st to 4th in top-3 counts.

Furthermore, Fig. 7(c) and (d) compare the total number of top-1 and top-3 placements achieved by specialist models versus EEG foundation models. To ensure a fair comparison given the larger number of foundation models, we selected the seven foundation models with the highest top-3 counts for this analysis. Specialist models achieved 15 first-place finishes and 47 top-3 placements, outperforming the selected foundation models.

Overall, specialist models achieved higher average decoding accuracy than EEG foundation models. It is also worth noting that the fine-tuning computational cost of foundation models is significantly higher than that of CNN-based and traditional machine learning methods. These results indicate that traditional deep learning architectures remain highly competitive in the era of foundation models.

3) Do Larger EEG Models Achieve Better Performance?:

achieved the highest overall ranking with an average rank of 5.96 and a model size of 4.0M parameters. EEGNet, a widely utilized lightweight EEG decoding backbone, attained second place with only 2K parameters. These results demonstrated that larger models do not necessarily yield better performance. This observation may be attributed to two factors: (1) EEG data acquisition incurs high costs in terms of time, labor, and resources, resulting in limited data availability and substantial noise levels, with a notable lack of large-scale, high-quality datasets [71]; (2) existing pre-training strategies for foundation models may be suboptimal, suggesting that developing pretrained decoding models capable of learning universal representations remains an essential research direction.

E. Comparison of Different Fine-tuning Ratios

In the within-subject few-shot scenario, a pre-trained model is expected to achieve satisfactory performance with minimal calibration data. However, many models exhibited suboptimal performance under this setting. To investigate whether this limitation is primarily attributable to insufficient fine-tuning data, we conducted an analysis across different fine-tuning data ratios, varying from 10% to 90% in increments of 20%. We selected three specialist models (EEGNet, ShallowConv, and LMDA) and the top three EEG foundation models (CBraMod, Neuro-GPT, and LaBraM). The results are presented in Fig. 9, with detailed results for all models across various datasets provided in Appendix C-B. Most models exhibited consistent

performance improvements as the amount of fine-tuning data increased, which aligns with intuitive expectations. However, minimal calibration or even calibration-free adaptation remains a critical requirement for practical deployment. Developing models that can rapidly adapt to downstream tasks with limited data remains an open and pressing challenge.

IV. DISCUSSION This section presents additional discussions.

- A. Paradigm-Specific Foundation Models

In real-world applications, the paradigm for a downstream task is generally determined prior to data collection. For example, stroke patients requiring exoskeleton-assisted rehabilitation are naturally suited to MI-based systems [85], while epilepsy monitoring demands epilepsy-specific approaches [86]. Therefore, when user information such as patient demographics and target applications is available, employing a paradigm-specific foundation model for direct adaptation represents a practical and effective strategy.

In recent years, several researchers have attempted to develop paradigm-specific foundation models tailored to particular tasks, such as MEET [26] for emotion recognition,

MIRepNet [49] for motor imagery, PSGFM [50] for sleep staging, and EpilepsyFM [53] for epilepsy detection. Among these, we compared MIRepNet, which provides open-source pre-trained weights, against existing general-purpose foundation models on MI tasks. Tables XV to XX in Appendix C present detailed results on three MI datasets: BNCI2014001, BNCI2014004, and BNCI2015001. MIRepNet achieved stateof-the-art performance in terms of both subject-averaged accuracy and Cohen’s Kappa. This superior performance may be attributed to the fact that paradigm-specific foundation models are pre-trained exclusively on datasets from the target task and incorporate neurophysiological principles relevant to that paradigm in their pre-training strategies. Consequently, the pre-trained encoder is capable of extracting task-specific representations that facilitate rapid adaptation to downstream applications.

Given that the required paradigm is typically known before data acquisition in practical BCI deployment, developing paradigm-specific pre-trained foundation models represents a viable and promising research direction. Furthermore, whether auxiliary data from other paradigms can enhance pre-training for a target paradigm remains an open question worthy of further investigation.

- B. Effectiveness of EA

As mentioned in Section II-C2, Euclidean alignment (EA) [72], [73] aligns the marginal distributions across EEG trials. Fig. 10 illustrates that trials from different subjects are mapped onto a common feature space after applying EA.

We compared model performance with and without EA on the BNCI2014001 dataset. As shown in Fig. 11, incorporating EA during training or fine-tuning improved generalization performance for the majority of models.

- C. Future Research Directions

1) Large-scale High-quality Data Construction: Noninvasive EEG signals inherently suffer from low signal-tonoise ratios due to hardware limitations, environmental interference, and variations in subject attention during acquisition. Several existing approaches attempt to reconstruct raw signals during pre-training, which may inadvertently encourage models to fit noise patterns rather than learn generalizable representations beneficial for downstream tasks. Furthermore, current EEG foundation models do not exhibit scaling law behavior, potentially due to the lack of large-scale, highquality EEG datasets. Liu et al. [71] demonstrated the importance of data quality in the MI paradigm by performing channel selection based on neurophysiological principles and removing low-quality subjects. Models trained on this cleaner and smaller dataset achieved superior performance compared to those trained on uncleaned data. Therefore, constructing

large-scale, high-quality EEG corpus through systematic data collection and rigorous cleaning procedures across diverse paradigms represents a critical direction for future research.

- 2) Paradigm-specific Foundation Models: As discussed

above, the target paradigm is typically known prior to downstream data acquisition, making paradigm-specific foundation models a practical and well-motivated approach. Recent works have explored this direction, including MEET [26] for emotion recognition, MIRepNet [49] for motor imagery, PSGFM [50] for sleep staging, and EpilepsyFM [53] for epilepsy detection. The results reported in Appendix C for MIRepNet demonstrate its superior performance on MI tasks. This advantage may stem from pre-training exclusively on paradigm-specific data while incorporating neurophysiological principles into the pretraining pipeline, enabling the model to learn more effective representations for the target paradigm. These findings support the validity, feasibility, and practicality of paradigm-specific foundation models as a promising research direction.

- 3) Efficient Pre-training Strategies: Most existing ap-

proaches adopt masked reconstruction as the primary pretraining objective, targeting raw signals, frequency-domain representations, or embedded tokens. However, no single model has demonstrated consistently strong performance across all tasks. Future research should address the following challenges: (1) developing more effective solutions for crossdevice heterogeneity; (2) designing pre-training strategies that enable models to learn truly universal and transferable representations; and (3) exploring efficient fine-tuning strategies

- (b) Accuracy comparison on the Nakanishi2015 dataset across different fine-tuning ratios.

V. CONCLUSION

This paper has presented a comprehensive benchmark for EEG foundation models in BCIs. We reviewed 50 studies and distilled their common pipeline components and pre-training objectives into a unified framework that enables structured comparison across heterogeneous devices and paradigms. Based on this analysis, we established a benchmark that evaluates 12 open-source EEG foundation models alongside competitive specialist baselines across 13 datasets spanning 9 representative BCI paradigms, under both cross-subject LOSO and within-subject few-shot evaluation protocols.

The experimental results indicate that current EEG foundation models have not yet achieved universally transferable representations. Specifically, full-parameter fine-tuning consistently provides substantial advantages over linear probing, suggesting that pre-trained encoders cannot be directly employed as fixed feature extractors across diverse downstream tasks. Furthermore, specialist models trained from scratch remain highly competitive, and increasing model size alone does not guarantee improved generalization. These findings highlight the need for future research on advancing pretraining strategies, as well as enhancing robustness to noise and cross-task heterogeneity. We hope that this benchmark serves as a standardized reference and accelerates the development of more reliable and practical foundation models for brain-computer interfaces.

APPENDIX A PRE-TRAINING AND DOWNSTREAM DATASETS

The pre-training and downstream datasets utilized by existing EEG foundation models are summarized in Tables VIII through XIV. These tables provide a systematic overview of the data resources employed by each foundation model, documenting both the datasets used during pre-training and those adopted for downstream evaluation.

APPENDIX B DATASET DESCRIPTIONS

The 13 datasets used in this benchmark are summarized below.

- 1) BNCI2014001 contains EEG data from 9 subjects performing four motor imagery tasks: left hand, right hand, both feet, and tongue. Each subject participated in two sessions, with each session consisting of 6 runs, yielding a total of 288 trials per session.
- 2) BNCI2015001 contains EEG data from 12 subjects performing sustained motor imagery of the right hand and both feet. The data were recorded at 512 Hz using 13 electrodes, with a bandpass filter between 0.5 and 100 Hz and a notch filter at 50 Hz.
- 3) BNCI2014004 contains EEG data from 9 right-handed subjects performing two motor imagery tasks: left hand and right hand. Each subject participated in five sessions, with the first two sessions for screening without feedback and the remaining three sessions with feedback. The data were recorded using three bipolar EEG channels (C3, Cz, C4) at 250 Hz, with 120 trials per subject for each motor imagery class.
- 4) BNCI2014009 contains P300 evoked potentials from 10 healthy subjects performing a 6 × 6 matrix speller task under overt attention conditions. EEG was recorded from 16 channels (Fz, FCz, Cz, CPz, Pz, Oz, F3, F4, C3, C4, CP3, CP4, P3, P4, PO7, PO8) at 256 Hz with 0.1–20 Hz bandpass filtering. Each subject completed four sessions with three runs per session.
- 5) BNCI2014008 contains P300 evoked potentials from 8 subjects with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) performing a 6×6 matrix speller task. EEG was recorded from 8 channels (Fz, Cz, Pz, Oz, P3, P4, PO7, PO8) at 256 Hz with 0.1–30 Hz bandpass filtering. Each subject completed seven runs of five-character spelling, yielding 35 trials in total.
- 6) CHB-MIT contains EEG recordings from 23 pediatric subjects with intractable seizures, recorded using a 16channel bipolar montage at 256 Hz. The dataset is used for seizure detection, a binary classification task to identify the presence of epileptic seizures from EEG signals.

Corpus, containing recordings from 2,383 adult patients with over 1,000 hours of data in total. The dataset is used for abnormal EEG detection, a binary classification task to distinguish pathological brain activity from normal recordings.

- 8) Sleep-EDFx (Sleep-EDF Expanded) is a polysomnographic dataset containing 197 whole-night recordings from 78 healthy subjects. Each recording includes EEG signals from Fpz–Cz and Pz–Oz derivations, annotated into five sleep stages: Wake, N1, N2, N3, and REM. The dataset serves as a standard benchmark for automatic sleep stage classification.
- 9) SEED (SJTU Emotion EEG Dataset) is a benchmark dataset for EEG-based emotion recognition, containing recordings from 15 subjects who watched 15 film clips across three sessions spaced one week apart. The 62channel EEG was recorded at 1,000 Hz using an ESI NeuroScan system, with each clip labeled as positive, neutral, or negative.
- 10) Nakanishi2015 is an SSVEP benchmark dataset for multi-class target identification. It contains EEG recordings from 9 subjects responding to 12 visual stimuli with frequencies ranging from 9.25 to 14.75 Hz. Each subject completed 15 blocks of 12 trials, yielding 180 trials per subject. EEG was recorded at 256 Hz using 8 occipital channels.
- 11) EEGMat is a cognitive workload dataset collected from 36 subjects during mental arithmetic tasks. EEG was recorded using 19 channels at 500 Hz following the international 10–20 system. Subjects were categorized into good and poor performers based on task accuracy, enabling analysis of individual differences in workloadrelated brain activity.
- 12) Things-EEG2 is a large-scale dataset for visual object decoding, containing EEG recordings from 10 participants viewing natural object images. The dataset comprises 16,740 image presentations covering 1,854 object classes from the THINGS image collection, supporting research on neural representations of visual semantics.
- 13) SEED-VIG is a dataset for EEG-based vigilance estimation collected during simulated driving. Vigilance levels are quantified using the PERCLOS (percentage of eye closure) metric derived from eye-tracking data. EEG was recorded at 200 Hz using 17 channels and segmented into 8-second epochs, supporting continuous vigilance prediction as a regression task.

all specialist and foundation models. The results are presented in Figs. 12 - 17.

Most models exhibited consistent performance improvements as the fine-tuning data ratio increased from 10% to 90%, which aligns with intuitive expectations. Notably, the relative ranking among models remained largely stable across different fine-tuning ratios. For instance, TRCA consistently achieved the highest accuracy on the Nakanishi2015 dataset regardless of the data ratio, while EEGNet maintained competitive performance across all settings on the BNCI2014008 dataset. This observation suggests that model superiority is relatively independent of fine-tuning data availability, and that a well-performing model under low-data conditions tends to preserve its advantage as more data becomes available. However, minimal calibration or even calibration-free adaptation remains a critical requirement for practical BCI deployment. Developing models capable of rapid adaptation to downstream tasks with limited calibration data continues to be an important and open challenge.
