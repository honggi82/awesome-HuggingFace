Figure 1: Overview of MATHNET. MATHNET contains 30K+ Olympiad-level problems across 47 countries, 17 languages, and 143 competitions over 40 years with expert-authored solutions. We evaluate several leading models on problem solving and math-aware retrieval.

ABSTRACT

Mathematical problem solving remains a challenging test of reasoning for large language and multimodal models, yet existing benchmarks are limited in size, language coverage, and task diversity. We introduce MATHNET, a high-quality, large-scale, multimodal, and multilingual dataset of Olympiad-level math problems together with a benchmark for evaluating mathematical reasoning in generative models and mathematical retrieval in embedding-based systems. MATHNET spans 47 countries, 17 languages, and two decades of competitions, comprising 30,676 expert-authored problems with solutions across diverse domains. In addition to the core dataset, we construct a retrieval benchmark consisting of mathematically equivalent and structurally similar problem pairs curated by human experts.

MATHNET supports three tasks: (i) Problem Solving, (ii) , Math-Aware Retrieval, and (iii) Retrieval-Augmented Problem Solving. Experimental results show that even state-of-the-art reasoning models (78.4% for Gemini-3.1-Pro and 69.3% for GPT-5) remain challenged, while embedding models struggle to retrieve equivalent problems. We further show that RAG performance is highly sensitive to retrieval quality; for example, DeepSeek-V3.2-Speciale achieves gains of up to 12%, obtaining the highest scores on the benchmark. MATHNET provides the largest high-quality Olympiad dataset together with the first benchmark for evaluating mathematical problem retrieval, and we publicly release both the dataset and benchmark at mathnet.mit.edu.

- 1 INTRODUCTION

Recent large language models (LLMs) and large multimodal models (LMMs) have made rapid improvements on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, from grade-school problems to competition mathematics (Cobbe et al., 2021; Hendrycks et al., 2021b; Achiam et al., 2023). Recently, public reports claimed unprecedented gold-medal–level performance at the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) by advanced multiple models (Luong et al., 2025; Shao et al., 2025). Moreover, there have been multiple incidents of AI systems reportedly solving open mathematical problems (Nie et al., 2025; Feldman & Karbasi, 2025).

Despite these advances, the lack of open, high quality, and diverse benchmarks constrains research progress. Existing Olympiad-level datasets are typically drawn from community platforms such as AoPS and cover only a handful of competitions in the U.S and China (see Table 1). To address this gap, we present MATHNET: a large-scale, multimodal, and multilingual collection of Olympiad-level mathematics problems sourced from 47 countries across four decades. The full dataset collection, MATHNET, contains 30K+ problems with high-quality official solutions written by experts across a wide range of mathematical domains. Its scale, diversity, and expert quality provide an unprecedented foundation for exploring mathematical generalization and analogical reasoning.

We use MATHNET to study two main capabilities: Problem Solving, or the ability to solve mathematical problems, and Math-Aware Retrieval, or the ability to recognize and retrieve mathematically equivalent or related problems. In particular, unlike existing semantic retrieval (Izacard et al., 2021; Khattab & Zaharia, 2020; Formal et al., 2021), our problem retrieval task must be aware of symbolic structure, invariances, and transformations. For example, the problem of solving x2 + y2 = 1 is equivalent to √a2 + b2 = 1, and is also equivalent to the set of 2D vectors with unit norm |u|2 = 1. Crucially, these are not equivalent to solving x + y = 1. Current retrieval models fail to make this distinction: due to superficial lexical overlap (Das et al., 2025), they often rank a problem containing x+y = 1 as closer to x2 +y2 = 1 than to the truly equivalent formulations. Despite the foundational importance of math-aware retrieval, we note this task remains largely unexplored in recent literature.

These challenges arise even in expert workflows such as the annual IMO exam selection process. During shortlist construction, problems may sometimes resemble problems that already exist in books, problem collections, or online sources, illustrating how difficult it can be to recognize mathematical equivalence across different notations, formats, and languages. Similar issues arise in mathematical research. For example, a mathematician studying bounds on gaps between consecutive primes may search for phrases such as “upper bounds on prime gaps” rather than a specific formula like pn+1−pn ≤ C(log pn)2 (where pn is the n-th prime and C is a constant). However, existing retrieval systems are often sensitive to superficial features such as variable naming or textual phrasing, making it difficult to connect mathematically equivalent statements expressed in different forms.

To make progress on these challenges, we introduce MATHNET, a collection of mathematics problems of unprecedented size supporting model analysis across three tasks: (i) Problem Solving, (ii) MathAware Retrieval, and (iii) Retrieval-Augmented Problem Solving. Our contributions are:

- 1. Main Corpus. MathNet-Solve, a 30K-problem collection of Olympiad-level math with aligned LaTeX and natural-language statements, expert solutions, and metadata spanning 47 countries, 17 languages, and 65+ mathematical domains.
- 2. Datasets for Retrieval. MathNet-Retrieve, a dataset for Math-Aware Retrieval comprised of 40K additional synthetic problems derived from 10K anchor problems, each paired with 1 equivalent positive and 3 hard negatives. MathNet-RAG, a dataset for Retrieval-Augmented Problem Solving built from 70 IMO-level expert-curated structurally similar problems.
- 3. Benchmark Evaluation. Benchmarking across 27 state-of-the-art models on three primary benchmarks: Problem Solving accuracy on MathNet-Solve, Math-Aware Retrieval using Recall@k on MathNet-Retrieve, and Retrieval-Augmented Problem Solving accuracy on MathNet-RAG, using both automatic grading and human expert grading.

- 4. Analysis: Solving vs. Retrieving. We demonstrate embedding model performance in MathAware Retrieval lags behind LLM and LMM performance in Problem Solving. Moreover, for Retrieval-Augmented Problem Solving, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) improves reasoning only when retrievers surface structure-aligned, mathematically relevant neighbors.

- 2 RELATED WORK

Mathematical problem solving has long been a core benchmark for evaluating AI reasoning capabilities. Early efforts focused on text-based arithmetic problems, while recent research has expanded to competition-level reasoning, theorem proving, and multimodal problem-solving. Existing datasets can be broadly categorized into text-only benchmarks, multimodal benchmarks, and aggregates.

Text-Only Mathematical Benchmarks. Several datasets evaluate LLMs’ mathematical reasoning using text-only problems. Cobbe et al. (2021) introduced GSM8K, grade-school level problems for elementary arithmetic reasoning. Hendrycks et al. (2021b) proposed MATH, which consists of problems spanning high school to competitive mathematics. Gao et al. (2024b) presented OmniMATH, with 4,428 Olympiad-level problems. He et al. (2024) and Wang et al. (2024) further extend coverage with bilingual and competition-level datasets, though most are limited in scale, language diversity, or structured similarity annotations.

Multimodal Mathematical Benchmarks. Multimodal benchmarks integrate visual information with textual descriptions, primarily for geometry or diagram-based reasoning. Datasets such as MATH-Vision (Wang et al., 2024) and MathVista (Lu et al., 2024) incorporate broad visual contexts, including charts and diagrams. Despite this added modality, these datasets remain comparatively easy and do not capture the full difficulty of Olympiad-level problem solving. Large-Scale Aggregates. Large datasets aggregate problems from multiple sources such as NuminaMath (Li et al., 2024b) and (Albalak et al., 2025). Although valuable for large-scale training and evaluation, these datasets typically lack curated multimodal content, multi-lingual coverage, and fine-grained annotations.

Math-Aware Retrieval. There has been work on formula-aware indexing (Zanibbi et al., 2025; Das et al., 2025), but such systems predate LLMs and typically operate at the formula level, missing broader conceptual and structural similarities expressed in natural language. Meanwhile, modern IR excels at semantic paraphrase but is often blind to symbolic equivalence and cross-modal cues.

Limitations of Prior Work and Motivation for MATHNET. Despite these advances, current benchmarks exhibit three main limitations: (i) limited expert solutions, (ii) lack of visual multilingual content, especially for high-difficulty problems, and (iii) limited analysis of mathematical problem retrieval. MATHNET addresses these gaps by offering a large-scale, multilingual, multimodal dataset of Olympiad-level problems. It includes expert-validated problem pairs and a fine-grained taxonomy of mathematical similarity, enabling rigorous study of analogical problem solving in generative models, retrieval quality in embedding-based systems, and retrieval-augmented reasoning across languages and modalities.

We include both unimodal and multimodal datasets, spanning grade-school to Olympiad-level mathematics. Our Proposed MATHNET expands coverage to 17 languages and focuses on proof- and process-based evaluation.

- 3 DATASET AND BENCHMARK DESIGN

MATHNET consists of Olympiad-level problems together with benchmarks in three tasks that evaluates mathematical reasoning in generative models, mathematical retrieval in embedding-based systems, and analogical reasoning with retrieval augmented generation.

A key feature of MATHNET is its fine-grained taxonomy of mathematical similarity, which enables systematic analysis of both solver and retriever performance across varying levels of structural and semantic overlap. To complement the dataset, we define a novel retrieval task that measures whether embedding-based systems can identify related problems based on deeper structural relationships rather than surface-level features. We further provide baselines and evaluations for both generative reasoning and retrieval, demonstrating the utility of the benchmark built on top of the dataset.

- 3.1 DATASETS AND TASKS

MATHNET consists of three datasets: MathNet-Solve, MathNet-Retrieve, and MathNet-RAG. The associated tasks are Problem Solving, Math-Aware Retrieval, and RetrievalAugmented Problem Solving. Benchmarks combine a task, a dataset, and an evaluation criterion.

- 1. MathNet-Solve: 30,676 expert-written Olympiad problems with solutions, spanning 47 countries, 17 languages, and 143 competitions. Divided into 3 splits: MathNet-Solve-train (23776 samples), -test (6400 samples), and -test-hard (500 samples). Serves as the source collection from which retrieval datasets are built. Supports Problem Solving via generated solutions graded against reference solutions. Figure 2 summarizes main statistics of the corpus.
- 2. MathNet-Retrieve: an evaluation dataset for Math-Aware Retrieval built from 10,000 anchor problems from MathNet-Solve. For each anchor, we construct 1 equivalent positive and 3 hard negatives, yielding 40,000 synthetic problems in total. Used to evaluate embedding models on retrieving mathematically equivalent problems.
- 3. MathNet-RAG: an evaluation dataset of 35 anchor problems and 35 expert-paired real problems all drawn entirely from MathNet-Solve; it is used for Retrieval-Augmented Problem Solving under both retrieved and oracle contexts.

- 3.2 DATA COLLECTION, EXTRACTION AND ANNOTATION

Data sources. Each year, participating IMO countries contribute original problems for use in their national contests and team selection examinations. To construct the dataset underlying the benchmark, we collect official problem booklets from 47 countries spanning 1985–2025, comprising 1595 PDF volumes and more than 25,000 pages in total. Unlike prior math benchmarks that often rely on community-sourced platforms such as AoPS, MathNet is built exclusively from officially published national materials. All included problems and solutions are authored and disseminated by national teams themselves, ensuring expert-level quality, consistency in style, and immunity from noisy or informal annotations. For more details, refer to section A.

Problems Extraction. We first convert all contest booklets into a Markdown format using the multilingual document parsing framework dots-ocr (Li et al., 2025; Zheng et al., 2026). This step establishes a uniform input format for downstream processing. The underlying source material spans a wide range of formats including both digital typeset documents and scanned copies, with some documents spanning several languages. We leverage the multilingual recognition and layout analysis capabilities of dots-ocr to robustly handle this variation and ensure consistent and faithful text extraction across diverse document types.

Problem-Solution Matching and Annotation In general, it is a difficult problem to extract aligned problem-solution pairs from large corpora of heterogeneous mathematical documents. In our dataset, some documents present problems and solutions in separate sections, while others interleave them. Numbering schemes and naming conventions vary not only across countries but often within a single document. These inconsistencies render traditional parsing techniques (e.g., regex-based heuristics) brittle and difficult to scale. To address this, we designed a novel LLM-based pipeline for problem–solution alignment (illustrated in Figure 3). Our approach operates in three stages:

- Stage 1: Document Ingestion and Problem Segmentation. To process each contest booklet, we first extract section-level segments, then pass these pages to Gemini-2.5-Flash to identify problem and solution corresponding segments by outputting only their line numbers. We also record the problem authors, hints and remarks (if present), as well as the and source file and page number to maintain provenance information for each problem.

- Stage 2: Problem and Solution Extraction. Given the line segments from Stage 1, we extract the text within these segments, along with additional buffer text before and after them in case any content is missing. We then use the prompt GPT-4.1 to extract the corresponding problem and solution in

a LATEX-friendly format. This strategy addresses the issue of problems and solutions appearing in different sections of the booklet, which may exceed the extraction model’s context window.

- Stage 3: Extraction Verification. We validate the extracted problem–solution pairs through a three-stage verification process of (1) a rule-based analytical checker, (2) GPT-4.1, and (3) human annotators. First, we compute text similarity between the extracted content and the original OCR output to ensure that LLM editing is restricted to formatting adjustments and introduces no hallucinated content. Second, we prompt GPT-4.1 to compare screenshots of the source pages with the extracted problem–solution pairs, acting as a judge (see Appendix F) to detect OCR errors, incorrect figure associations, or mismatches between problems and solutions, and determine whether the solution is complete. Finally, we manually review cases with low confidence scores. A problem–solution pair is retained only if all three verification mechanisms reach unanimous agreement.

- 3.3 RETRIEVAL IN MATHEMATICS

- 3.3.1 UNDERSTANDING DIFFERENT TYPES OF MATHEMATICAL SIMILARITY

Mathematical progress often depends on recognizing when different problems share common structure. These structural commonalities can take several forms, from strict equivalence to looser thematic connections. We distinguish three modes of similarity: Invariance, Resonance, and Affinity. For examples see Table 2.

Invariance refers to strict equivalence under transformation. Two problems are invariant when they differ only in representation but share the same underlying structure. Examples include syntactic renaming, algebraic reformulation, geometric re-characterization, or cross-domain isomorphism.

Resonance refers to partial similarity. Problems are not identical, but they can be addressed using the same idea, proof strategy, or structural analogy. Resonance highlights opportunities to transfer tools or insights across contexts.

Affinity refers to a broad sense of relatedness without structural equivalence. Problems may belong to the same conceptual or disciplinary area (e.g., number theory, geometry) even if they do not share a method or solution strategy. Affinity provides a way to group problems by theme, context, or historical development.

Mode Problem A Problem B Invariance Syntactic Equivalence Find f : R → R such that f(x2 − y2) = (x − y)(f(x) + f(y)). Find g : R → R such that (g(a) + g(b))(a − b) = g(a2 − b2). Reformulation Let ai > 0. Prove ni=1 ai

ab+1 is a perfect square. If a2 + b2 + c2 = k(ab + bc + ca), show that k ∈ {1,2,3}. Structural Reduction Prove that 4n + 2n + 1 is never a prime number. Prove that 22n + 2n + 1 is divisible by 3 for all n. Affinity (Thematic) Show that the largest prime factor of 2nn is greater than n2/3. For every n > 1, there is a prime p such that n < p < 2n.

Table 2: Taxonomy of mathematical similarity with Olympiad-style examples. Invariance captures strict equivalence under reformulation, Structural Resonance reflects shared lemmas or reductions, and Affinity denotes looser thematic clustering.

- 3.3.2 BUILDING MATHNET-RETRIEVE

We constructed this dataset to support Math-Aware Retrieval, whcih aims to distinguish between surface-level lexical overlap and deep mathematical equivalence. MathNet-Retrieve is built from 10,000 anchor problems drawn from MathNet-Solve. For each anchor, we use GPT-5 (prompt details in the Appendix) to generate exactly 1 equivalent positive and 3 hard negatives, yielding 40,000 synthetically derived problems in total.

Equivalent Positives. For each anchor problem, we generate one mathematically equivalent variant via variable renaming (e.g., x → a), algebraic manipulation, and paraphrasing using GPT-5 (prompt details in the Appendix). For example, the functional equation f(x) + f(y) = f(x + y) can be rewritten as an algebraically equivalent variant such as g(a) − g(a + b) = −g(b).

Hard Negatives. For each anchor, we also generate three adversarial hard negatives that preserve much of the surface form while changing the underlying mathematics (e.g., f(x2)+f(y) = f(x−y)). These near-miss distractors make it difficult for models to succeed by relying only on lexical similarity.

- 3.3.3 BUILDING MATHNET-RAG

We also construct MathNet-RAG as a non-synthetic evaluation dataset of expert-paired real Olympiad problems, supporting Retrieval-Augmented Problem Solving. The dataset is organized

- as 35 anchors paired with 35 expert-curated pairs, 70 problems total drawn from real Olympiad competitions. Each pair lies in the Structural Resonance category of our taxonomy and exhibits similarities such as Generalization, Common Lemma, or Structural Reduction. These pairs capture a human expert notion of similarity that goes substantially beyond simple algebraic transformation.

##### Example Conceptual Problem Pair from MathNet-RAG

- Problem A. [Chinese TST 2014] Show that there are no 2-tuples (x, y) of positive integers satisfying (x + 1)(x + 2) · · · (x + 2014) = (y + 1)(y + 2) · · · (y + 4028).
- Problem B. [Russia 2009] Alireza multiplied a billion consecutive natural numbers, and Matin multiplied two million consecutive natural numbers. Prove that these two got different results or one of them has made a mistake.

- 4 EXPERIMENTS

- 4.1 EXPERIMENTAL SETUP

We evaluate 27 models on MATHNET using three benchmarks: Problem Solving accuracy on MathNet-Solve, Math-Aware Retrieval using Recall@k on MathNet-Retrieve, and Retrieval-Augmented Problem Solving accuracy on MathNet-RAG.

On MathNet-Solve, we evaluate two types of models: (i) LLMs and LMMs, including gpt-4o, Llama-4-Maverick-17B-128E-Instruct-FP8, and Grok-3. For models that accept images, we provide both the text and image as input; otherwise, we supply a textonly description of the image. (ii) LLMs and LMMs with deliberate reasoning, including gemini-3.1-pro-preview, gemini-3-flash-preview, gemini-2.5-flash, claude-opus-4.6, gpt-5, gpt-5-mini, gpt-5-nano, and DeepSeek-R1.

On MathNet-Retrieve, we evaluate retrieval performance using embeddings derived from a diverse set of state-of-the-art models, including all-mpnet-base-v2, multi-qa-mpnet-base-dot-v1, cohere-embed-v4.0, qwen3-embedding-4B, gemini-embedding-001, text-embedding-ada-002, text-embedding-3-small, and text-embedding-3-large. We compute similarities between problem statements using cosine similarity over the embedding representations.

On MathNet-RAG, we limit the evaluations to seven state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary models, as this benchmark requires human grading. The models are gemini-3-pro-preview, gpt-5, claude-opus-4.5, DeepSeek-V3.2-Speciale, oLMO-3-Think, Grok-4.1-Fast, and Phi-4-reasoning-plus. For each model we evaluate three inference settings: (i) Zero Shot, where the model receives only the target problem; (ii) Embed-RAG, where we retrieve one related problem using embeddings from gemini-embedding-001 and provide that retrieved problem together with its official solution; and (iii) Expert-RAG, where we instead provide the expert-paired related problem from MathNet-RAG together with its official solution.

- 4.2 EVALUATION PROTOCOL

Problem Solving on MathNet-Solve. Similar to the protocol introduced in IMO-Bench (Luong et al., 2025), we adopt a score-based model grading procedure using GPT-5. For each problem, the judge model is provided with the problem statement, the reference solution, and the model-generated solution, and is asked to assess whether the output is consistent with the correct answer using a numeric score from 0–7. We binarize the score by marking outputs with score ≥ 6 as correct (fully correct or containing only minor errors) and scores < 6 as incorrect. This allows us to distinguish between models that arrive at the correct final answer by coincidence versus those that demonstrate consistent reasoning ability. We also report performance by subject domain (algebra, geometry, combinatorics, number theory), enabling a fine-grained analysis of model strengths and weaknesses.

Math-Aware Retrieval on MathNet-Retrieve. The primary evaluation metric for our retrieval task is Recall@k, which measures whether any of the top-k retrieved problems correspond to a “correct” match from our equivalent versions of each problem. We report Recall@1 and Recall@5. To better understand embedding behavior, we further analyze cosine similarity distributions between equivalent problem pairs, unrelated pairs, and near misses (hard negatives), highlighting cases where models struggle to separate fine-grained distinctions.

Retrieval-Augmented Problem Solving on MathNet-RAG. To assess the impact of retrieval on downstream problem solving, we evaluate three settings. In Zero Shot, the model receives only the target problem. In Embed-RAG, we retrieve one related problem using gemini-embedding-001, then provide the retrieved problem and its official solution as additional context. In Expert-RAG, we replace the retrieved example with the expert-paired related problem from MathNet-RAG, again together with its official solution. Comparing Zero Shot, Embed-RAG, and Expert-RAG isolates the effect of retrieval quality: the gap from Zero Shot to Embed-RAG measures the value of retrieved context from an embedding retriever, while the gap from Embed-RAG to Expert-RAG measures how much performance is still limited by retrieval errors.

- 4.3 MAIN RESULTS 4.3.1 PROBLEM SOLVING ON MATHNET-SOLVE

- Table 3 reports Problem Solving accuracy on MathNet-Solve across four core domains: Algebra, Number Theory, Geometry, and Discrete Mathematics. The strongest overall model is gemini-3.1-pro, which achieves 76.3% overall accuracy, followed by gemini-2.5-pro at 71.9%, and gpt-5 and gemini-3-flash-preview, both at 68.1%. Across models, Algebra is consistently the easiest domain, with the top systems reaching 82.9%, while Geometry and Discrete Mathematics remain the most challenging: even gpt-5, despite strong Algebra (79.4%) and Number Theory (73.0%) performance, drops to 56.3% on Geometry and 64.1% on Discrete Mathematics. A clear performance stratification emerges. Frontier reasoning models—especially the Gemini

- 3.1/2.5 and GPT-5 families—substantially outperform earlier or smaller models. Mid-tier systems such as claude-opus-4-6, gpt-5-nano, DeepSeek-V3.2, and gemini-2.5-flash achieve overall scores between 38.8% and 43.9%, while weaker baselines including grok-3, DeepSeek-V3-0324, gpt-4.1, Llama-4-Maverick-17B-128E-Instruct-FP8, gpt-4o, and Ministral-3B lag far behind. Notably, the gap between the top and bottom of the table is large: gemini-3.1-pro-preview outperforms Ministral-3B by 72.7 points overall. Overall, these results highlight that Olympiad-level mathematical reasoning remains challenging even for state-of-the-art systems, with the largest appearing in Geometry and Discrete Mathematics. For more detailed breakdowns by language and multimodality, see Appendix D.

- 4.3.2 MATH-AWARE RETRIEVAL ON MATHNET-RETRIEVE

- As shown in Table 4, Math-Aware Retrieval on MathNet-Retrieve remains highly challenging at the top-1 level, with even the strongest models (Qwen3-embedding-4B and Gemini-embedding-001) achieving only ∼5% Recall@1. Performance improves markedly

at higher cutoffs, with Recall@10 exceeding 80% in several domains. Among all models, Gemini-embedding-001 provides the most consistent gains, delivering the highest Recall@5 and Recall@10 across domains and the strongest aggregate performance (68.88% and 83.79%, respectively). In contrast, legacy embedding models such as text-embedding-ada-002 and text-embedding-3-small perform substantially worse across all settings.

These results suggest that current general-purpose embedding models fail to capture the deep structural and symbolic relationships that define mathematical equivalence. A critical failure mode is that both LLMs and LMMs often rely on superficial textual overlap (e.g., matching on keywords such as “triangle” or “polynomial”) rather than reasoning over the underlying mathematical concepts. The weak top-1 retrieval performance highlights that these models lack a robust internal representation of mathematical knowledge that would support analogical reasoning across problem variants. This gap underscores the need for embeddings explicitly trained to encode mathematical structure, rather than depending on incidental surface-level cues.

To further illustrate this issue, Figure 6 shows the distribution of cosine similarities between equivalent and non-equivalent problems. Surprisingly, non-equivalent pairs often exhibit higher similarity scores than equivalent ones. This counterintuitive trend highlights that embeddings frequently capture superficial lexical or symbolic overlap rather than true structural relationships, leading models to mis-rank distinct problems as closer than genuinely equivalent ones. This explains the weak Recall@1 performance observed in Table 4.

Table 4: Math-Aware Retrieval on MathNet-Retrieve (10,000 anchor problems). Results are reported as Recall@1 and Recall@5 across four domains and overall, with best results in bold and second-best results underlined. Takeaway: Across domains, Recall@1 remains low even for the strongest models, while gemini-embedding-001 and qwen3-embedding-4B achieve the best overall Recall@5, highlighting that current embedding models retrieve mathematically equivalent problems only reliably at larger retrieval depths.

4.3.3 RETRIEVAL-AUGMENTED PROBLEM SOLVING ON MATHNET-RAG

- As shown in Table 5, Expert-RAG is the strongest setting overall, but the gains are not uniform across models or grading protocols. Under human grading, DeepSeek-V3.2-Speciale reaches the best result in the table at 97.3% with Expert-RAG, and GPT-5 also improves substantially from 76.8% in Zero Shot to 86.6% in Expert-RAG. At the same time, the table also shows that stronger retrieved context does not guarantee gains for every model: for example, Gemini-3-Pro is best under human grading in Zero Shot and Embed-RAG, while Claude-4.5-Opus and oLMO-3-Think show smaller or mixed changes under human grading. Under average LLM grading, the same overall pattern holds: Expert-RAG is often competitive or best, but Embed-RAG is less reliable and can fall below Zero Shot, as seen for Grok-4.1-Fast, Gemini-3-Pro, and oLMO-3-Think. Taken together, the table suggests that retrieval helps most when the added example is truly structure-aligned. Embed-RAG can help, but its benefits are inconsistent because embedding-based retrieval sometimes returns near-miss problems that add noise rather than useful mathematical guidance.

- Table 5: Retrieval-Augmented Problem Solving on MathNet-RAG (35 problems). Results are reported as accuracy (%) ± standard error under human grading and average LLM grading across three inference settings: zero-shot, Embed-RAG, and Expert-RAG; best results are shown in bold and second-best results are underlined. Takeaway: Expert-RAG yields the most consistent gains, but improvements remain model-dependent and grading-dependent.

- 5 DISCUSSION AND LIMITATION

Results on MATHNET reveal a clear gap between strong generative performance on Problem Solving and weak performance on Math-Aware Retrieval for mathematical equivalence. While frontier LLMs and LMMs achieve impressive scores on answer-generation benchmarks, our retrieval results show that current embedding-based systems still struggle to capture mathematical structure. The limited gains from visual augmentation further suggest that multimodal integration for symbolic tasks remains underdeveloped.

The strong performance of the formula-aware baseline indicates that structured, non-textual representations are crucial for retrieval. Progress in true mathematical reasoning may require moving beyond next-token prediction toward architectures that explicitly integrate symbolic reasoning.

- 6 CONCLUSION

In this work, we introduced MATHNET to analyze current models in Problem Solving, Math-Aware Retrieval, and Retrieval-Augmented Problem Solving. By providing a corpus of 30,676 problems with a fine-grained taxonomy of equivalence, we enabled a rigorous study of mathematical generalization and analogical reasoning. To ensure reliability, we complemented automated extraction with systematic human validation: expert annotators reviewed problem similarity labels, and student evaluators assessed the alignment and completeness of extracted problem–solution pairs. These human contributions establish a strong ground-truth foundation, ensuring that MATHNET captures deep mathematical structure rather than superficial overlap.

Our comprehensive evaluations show that while frontier generative models can solve complex problems, current retrieval systems still struggle with a fundamental yet overlooked task: retrieving mathematically equivalent or structurally related problems from large corpora. This deficiency in retrieval highlights a key limitation in current learned representations of mathematical knowledge. We hope MATHNET will serve as a valuable resource for the community, paving the way for research into improved retrieval-augmented reasoning, symbolic AI, and ultimately, more capable and reliable problem-solving models.

### C DATASET EXAMPLES AND ADDITIONAL STATISTICS

###### Example from MathNet-Solve

Problem. Given positive integers m and n, find the smallest integer N (≥ m) with the following property: if an N-element set of integers contains a complete residue system modulo m, then it has a nonempty subset whose sum is divisible by n.

###### Answer.

- 1

- 2

N = max m, m + n −

m (m, n) + 1 .

Solution. Let d = (m, n), and write m = dm1, n = dn1. We first prove the lower bound

- 1

- 2

N ≥ max m, m + n −

m(d + 1) .

Assume n > 12m(d + 1). Choose a complete residue system modulo m, say x1, . . . , xm, whose residues modulo n consist of exactly m1 copies of each of 1, 2, . . . , d. For instance, one may take

###### i + dn1j, i = 1, 2, . . . , d, j = 1, 2, . . . , m1.

Now let k = n − 12m(d + 1) − 1, and choose k further integers y1, . . . , yk, all congruent to 1 modulo n. Then

A = {x1, . . . , xm, y1, . . . , yk} contains a complete residue system modulo m. However, no nonempty subset of A has sum divisible by n: indeed, the sum of the least nonnegative residues modulo n of all elements of A is at least 1 and at most

- 1

- 2

m1d(d + 1) + k = n − 1. Hence no nonempty subset sum can be congruent to 0 modulo n. Therefore

m1(1 + 2 + · · · + d) + k =

- 1

- 2

N ≥ m + n −

m(d + 1),

which gives the claimed lower bound. Next we show that

- 1

- 2

N = max m, m + n −

m(d + 1)

does have the required property. We need the following standard fact: among any k integers, there exists a nonempty subset whose sum is divisible by k. Indeed, for integers a1, . . . , ak, let

Si = a1 + · · · + ai (1 ≤ i ≤ k).

If some Si ≡ 0 (mod k), we are done. Otherwise, two of the Si have the same residue modulo k, say Si ≡ Sj (mod k) with i < j, and then

ai+1 + · · · + aj = Sj − Si ≡ 0 (mod k). A useful corollary is: among any k integers each divisible by a, one can find a nonempty subset whose sum is divisible by ka. We now split into two cases.

- Case 1: n ≤ 12m(d + 1), so N = m. Let x1, . . . , xm be a complete residue system modulo m. Since m = dm1, these may be partitioned into

- m1 groups, each of which is a complete residue system modulo d. Call a finite set of integers a d-set if the sum of its elements is divisible by d. If d is odd, write a complete residue system modulo d as y1, . . . , yd with yi ≡ i (mod d). Then each such group can be partitioned into d+12 d-sets, for example

{y1, yd−1}, {y2, yd−2}, . . . , yd−1

, {yd}.

, yd+1

(see next page)

###### Continue; Example from MathNet-Solve

Thus altogether we obtain 12m1(d + 1) d-sets. Since

- 1

- 2

n1 ≤

m1(d + 1),

the corollary implies that some collection of these d-sets has total sum divisible by n1d = n. If d is even, similarly each complete residue system modulo d yields d2 d-sets, with one element left over; pairing leftovers from two such groups gives one more d-set. In total, from x1, . . . , xm we obtain

m1 2 d-sets. Since

- 2

m1d +

- 1

- 2

- 1

- 2

- 1

- 2

n1 ≤

m1(d + 1) =

m1d +

m1,

we again have enough d-sets to apply the corollary and obtain a nonempty subset whose sum is divisible by n.

- Case 2: n > 12m(d + 1), so

- 1

- 2

N = m + n −

m(d + 1).

Let A be an N-element set containing a complete residue system modulo m, say x1, . . . , xm, together with n − 12m(d + 1) additional elements. If d is odd, then as in Case 1 the elements x1, . . . , xm can be partitioned into

- 1

- 2

m1(d + 1) d-sets. Partition the remaining elements arbitrarily into

- 1

- 2

n1 −

m1(d + 1)

groups of size d. From each such group, by the corollary, one can extract a d-set. Hence altogether we obtain exactly n1 d-sets. Applying the corollary once more to the sums of these n1 d-sets, we find a nonempty union of them whose total sum is divisible by n1d = n. If d is even, then from x1, . . . , xm we obtain

- 1

- 2

m1 2

m1d +

d-sets, as in Case 1. If m1 is even, the remaining elements can be grouped so as to produce another n1 −

- 1

- 2

m1(d + 1)

d-sets, giving again a total of n1 d-sets. If m1 is odd, one element xi remains with

d 2

d | xi −

. Partition the other remaining elements into

2n1 − m1(d + 1)

groups of size d2. Each such group contains a subset whose sum is divisible by d2, and any two such d2-sets combine to form a d-set. Together with {xi}, this again yields enough d-sets to obtain n1 of them in total. Applying the corollary as above gives a nonempty subset with sum divisible by n.

Therefore, in all cases,

- 2

N = max m, m + n −

m (m, n) + 1 .

###### Example from MathNet-Solve with figures

Problem. Andrew and Olesya take turns cutting out either a 2 × 2 square or a 1 × 1 square from a 2 × 2n rectangle, always along the grid lines, in such a way that after every move the remaining figure stays connected. The player who cannot make a move loses. Determine who wins if both play optimally and Olesya moves first.

[Figure 33]

Solution. We proceed by induction on n. For n = 1, the board is 2 × 2, and Olesya wins immediately by removing the whole 2 × 2 square. For

- n = 2, the board is 2 × 4, and Andrew wins by direct case analysis. Now suppose n = 2m + 1 is odd. Then Olesya can remove a 2 × 2 square from one end of the strip, reducing the game to the case of even n. Thus it remains to prove that for even n, the second player has a winning strategy. Consider therefore a board of size 2 × 2k. Until and including the first time the first player cuts a 1 × 1 square from a bordering column of the active strip, the second player follows a symmetric strategy. This is always possible, and the first such move must occur when the active playing field has size 2 × ℓ with ℓ even. From that point onward, it suffices for the second player to prevent the first player from ever removing a 2 × 2 square. Indeed, once this is impossible, all remaining moves consist of removing 1 × 1 squares, so the game ends after an even number of further moves, which is favorable to the second player. The only positions from which a 2 × 2 square can be removed are the two ends of the active strip. Hence the second player simply ensures that no end becomes a removable 2 × 2 block. Concretely, whenever there is a “free” end, he removes one 1 × 1 square from that bordering 2 × 2 block. There can never be more than one free end at a time: Olesya cannot create two in a single move, and initially there are none. If there is no free end, then one of the following applies at a bordering column:

- 1. If the bordering column has no removed square, Andrew removes one unit square from it.
- 2. If the bordering column has exactly one removed square:

- a) if the second-to-border column also has a removed square, Andrew removes the second square from the bordering column;
- b) if the second-to-border column has no removed square, then:

- i. if the third-to-border column is empty, or has a removed square in the same row, Andrew removes a unit square from the second-to-border column in that row;
- ii. if the third-to-border column has a removed square in the other row, Andrew removes a unit square from the bordering column, shrinking the active strip without creating a free end.

In every case, Andrew can respond so that no removable 2 × 2 square appears at an end. Therefore the parity of the remaining 1 × 1 moves is controlled in his favor, and the second player wins for even n. Combining this with the odd case, we conclude:

|Olesya wins when n is odd, and Andrew wins when n is even.|

###### Example from MathNet-Solve

Problem. Fatima and Asma are playing the following game. First, Fatima chooses 2013 pairwise different numbers, called a1, a2, . . . , a2013. Then, Asma tries to know the value of each number a1, a2, . . . , a2013. At each time, Asma chooses 1 ≤ i < j ≤ 2013 and asks Fatima "What is the set {ai, aj}?" (For example, if Asma asks what is the set {a1, a2}, and a1 = 17 and a2 = 13, Fatima will answer {13, 17}). Find the least number of questions Asma needs to ask, to know the value of all the numbers a1, a2, . . . , a2013.

###### Solution.

The least number of subsets is 28. Suppose that Bibi has 3 lists 1, 2, 3 which enable her to find N with certainty. Let the lists contain a1, a2, a3 subsets respectively. For list i = 1, 2, 3 Alex announces the number xi of subsets in the list that contain N, and the ordered triple x1, x2, x3 is the only information Bibi obtains. So being able to guess N with certainty means that each triple x1, x2, x3 yields a certain N ∈ {1, 2, ..., 1001} as a solution. Because there are 1001 possible numbers N and Alex can choose any of them, it is then necessary that the number of different triples x1, x2, x3 is at least 1001. This number equals (a1 + 1)(a2 + 1)(a3 + 1) as there are ai + 1 possible values of xi, namely 0, 1, ..., ai (i = 1, 2, 3). Hence we must have

(a1 + 1)(a2 + 1)(a3 + 1) ≥ 1001.

Now use the AM-GM inequality to estimate the total number a1 + a2 + a3 of subsets used by Bibi:

3

a1 + a2 + a3 3

1001 ≤ (a1 + 1)(a2 + 1)(a3 + 1) ≤

+ 1

It follows from here that a1 + a2 + a3 ≥ 28. Indeed if a1 + a2 + a3 ≤ 27 then the right-hand side of the displayed inequality is at most 273 + 1 3 = 1000. Now we show that 3 lists with a total of 28 sets suffice. Use the factorization 1001 = 7 · 11 · 13, consider a 7 × 11 × 13 parallelepiped with the numbers 1, 2, ..., 1001 written in its unit cubes. Let the vertical dimension be 13, then there are 13 horizontal layers of unit cubes (of dimensions 7×11). For i = 1, 2, ..., 12 let Si be the union of the first i horizontal layers. Let list 1 consist of the 12 sets S1, S2, ..., S12, and let Alex say that x1 of them contain N. Observe that this answer enables Bibi to determine the horizontal layer containing N, whatever the announced value x1 ∈ {0, 1, ..., 12}. Indeed, since S1 ⊂ S2 ⊂ ... ⊂ S12, the answer x1 = 0 means that N is in layer 13, x1 = 1 means that it is in layer 12, etc. In general x1 = i ∈ {0, 1, ..., 12} implies that N is in horizontal layer 13−i. Thus a list of 12 sets is enough to single out the necessary layer out of 13 possible ones. Analogous lists in the other two directions, with 7 − 1 = 6 sets and 11 − 1 = 10 sets, can determine the layers in those directions that contain N. As a result N becomes known with 12 + 6 + 10 = 28 sets, with 3 lists used. If Bibi uses 2 lists with a1 and a2 sets then by the same reasoning it is necessary that

2

a1 + a2 2

, hence a1 + a2 ≥ 61. Finally it is clear that one list alone would require at least 1000 sets.

1001 ≤ (a1 + 1)(a2 + 1) ≤

- E LLM GRADERS VS HUMAN EXPERT GRADERS ON MATHNET-RAG

We benchmark the accuracy of a wide range of LLM graders and compare their judgments to human expert grading for Retrieval-Augmented Problem Solving on MathNet-RAG. This evaluation quantifies how reliably current models can act as automatic graders for Olympiad-level mathematical reasoning. For each model, we report Retrieval-Augmented Problem Solving performance under three settings: zero-shot, embed-RAG, and expert-RAG. This measures both cross-model grading consistency and alignment with human scoring.

- Table 11: LLM Grading vs. human expert grading on MathNet-RAG (35 problems). For each solver and retrieval setting, we report the score assigned by four LLM graders, their mean (LLM Avg.), and the corresponding human expert score; all entries are accuracy (%) ± standard error. Takeaway: LLM graders broadly track the same solver ranking as human experts.

GRADING_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """ You are an expert grader for the International Mathematics Olympiad (IMO). Your task is to strictly and rigorously evaluate a proposed solution

using official IMO standards. Only fully justified, logically sound arguments may receive credit.

===================================================================== GENERAL SCORING RUBRIC (0-7)

=====================================================================

- - 7 points: Correct A complete, correct, fully rigorous solution. Earlier incorrect attempts

do not reduce the score if the final solution is fully correct.

- -6 points: Almost Correct The main idea is correct, and only minor gaps or small fixable errors

remain. Missing major steps or relying on unjustified claims does not qualify.

- - 1 point: Partial Progress The student demonstrates substantial progress toward the solution. Reformulations, trivial observations, or irrelevant partial results do

not qualify.

- - 0 points: Incorrect The solution contains fundamental logical flaws or makes no significant

progress. Fake proofs, circular arguments, or unjustified assumptions receive 0.

===================================================================== PROBLEM TYPE: {problem_type}

===================================================================== ===================================================================== PROBLEM STATEMENT

===================================================================== {problem_statement}

===================================================================== GROUND-TRUTH SOLUTION

===================================================================== {solution}

===================================================================== GROUND-TRUTH FINAL ANSWER

===================================================================== {final_answer}

===================================================================== STUDENT SOLUTION

===================================================================== {student_answer}

===================================================================== EVALUATION PROCEDURE

=====================================================================

- 1. Study the official solution to understand the essential steps and criteria for partial credit.

- 2. Analyze the student’s solution line-by-line, identifying every gap, unjustified inference, incorrect claim, or flaw in logic.

- 3. Determine whether the student makes any nontrivial progress toward the solution.

- 4. Assign the score strictly according to the IMO rubric.

===================================================================== CLARIFICATION: Meaning of ’final_answer_correct’

===================================================================== ’final_answer_correct’ refers only to whether the student’s final stated

answer matches the ground-truth final answer (numerically, algebraically, or structurally).

The student’s final answer is typically enclosed in \\boxed{{}} -- use that as the answer to compare. It does NOT evaluate the correctness, completeness, or rigor of the student’s reasoning.

Use ’doesn’t apply’ in either of these cases:

- - the problem type is ’proof only’ (no final answer expected), OR

- - the student gives no \\boxed{{}} answer. Examples:

- - Correct \\boxed{{}} answer but no valid argument -> ’yes’

- - Incorrect \\boxed{{}} answer but mostly correct reasoning -> ’no’

- - No \\boxed{{}} answer -> ’doesn\’t apply’

- - Proof-only problem -> ’doesn\’t apply’

===================================================================== OUTPUT FORMAT (MUST FOLLOW EXACTLY)

===================================================================== Output exactly one JSON object:

{{

’score’: {{ ’points’: 0, ’label’: ’0 out of 7’

}}, ’analysis’: {{

’detailed_reasoning’: ’’, ’identified_errors’: [], ’partial_progress_assessment’: ’’

}}, ’meta’: {{

’final_answer_correct’: ’yes | no | doesn\’t apply’, ’contains_logic_errors’: ’yes | no’

}}

}} RULES

- - You must output nothing outside the JSON.

- - ’points’ must be one of: 0, 1, 6, 7.

- - ’label’ must match exactly: ’X out of 7’.

- - All fields are required. """

Listing 3: System prompt for topics, final answer, and metadata extraction

SYSTEM_PROMPT = r""" You are a rigorous math-olympiad content analyzer. You will be given one ’problem package’ containing:

- - A problem statement

- - One or more official solutions (labeled ’Solution 1’, "Solution 2",

...)

- - Optional final answers Your tasks are: ===================================================================== Classify the problem into exactly one of the following:

=====================================================================

- 1. TOPIC EXTRACTION

=====================================================================

- Assign the problem its most specific topics from the taxonomy.

- - Each topic path must be an array of strings from general -> specific.

- - Include ALL paths relevant to the problem or solutions.

- - Every topic path must be a verbatim copy of a path from the taxonomy.

- - No paraphrasing, renaming, reordering, or combining nodes.

- - Every topic must begin with "Topics".

=====================================================================

- 2. MAIN IDEAS / TRICKS / TOOLS

=====================================================================

- - Produce a bullet list of the key structural insights or tools used.

- - Examples:

- - Techniques used

- - Classical lemmas or theorems applied

- - Core inequality strategies

- - Key constructions or combinatorial ideas

- - Do NOT retell the whole solution; extract the essential tools.

=====================================================================

- 3. NATURAL-LANGUAGE PROBLEM DESCRIPTION

=====================================================================

- - Summarize the core task of the problem in normal English.

- - NO mathematical symbols at all (no variables, no equations, no angle notation, etc.)

- - A high-level, intuitive, short description.

=====================================================================

- 4. PROBLEM TYPE CLASSIFICATION

- - "proof only": no explicit final numeric/closed-form answer is required.

- - "final answer only": problem only asks for a value/choice with no proof required.

- - "proof and answer": requires both reasoning and a final value/statement.

- - "MCQ": problem requires choosing from given options.

===================================================================== =====================================================================

- 5. FINAL ANSWER EXTRACTION

- - If the problem requires a final numeric/closed-form expression, value, or choice, extract it.

- - If the problem’s nature does NOT require a final answer (e.g., proofonly), output ‘null‘.

Specific rules:

- - If multiple solutions exist, the final answer must match the official answer section if present.

- - Accept integers, expressions, ranges, choices, constructed forms, etc.

- - For MCQ, return the *selected option* if identifiable; otherwise null.

===================================================================== TAXONOMY BLOCK

===================================================================== Use this taxonomy for the "topics" field. Each topic path must follow the hierarchy strictly.

|-- Topics | |-- Geometry | | |-- Plane Geometry | | | |-- Triangles | | | | |-- Triangle centers: centroid, incenter, | | | | | circumcenter, orthocenter, Euler line, | | | | | nine-point circle | | | | |-- Triangle inequalities | | | | |-- Triangle trigonometry | | | |-- Quadrilaterals | | | | |-- Cyclic quadrilaterals | | | | |-- Inscribed/circumscribed quadrilaterals | | | | |-- Quadrilaterals with perpendicular diagonals | | | |-- Circles | | | | |-- Coaxal circles | | | | |-- Tangents | | | | |-- Radical axis theorem | | | | |-- Circle of Apollonius | | | |-- Concurrency and Collinearity | | | | |-- Ceva’s theorem | | | | |-- Menelaus’ theorem

... (more topics here)

===================================================================== OUTPUT FORMAT (STRICT JSON)

===================================================================== Return ONLY a JSON object: {

"topics": [ ["Topics", "...", "..."], ["Topics", "...", "..."]

], "main_ideas": [

- "key idea 1",

- "key idea 2",

- "key idea 3"

], "natural_language_description": "...",

"final_answer": "... or null", "problem_type": "proof only | final answer only | proof and answer |

MCQ", "confidence": 0.0-1.0

} Rules:

- - NO text outside the JSON.

- - NO markdown in the output.

- - natural_language_description must contain zero mathematical symbols.

- - Confidence reflects how certain you are about the classification. """

LLMs Usage in the Paper The authors made use of large language models (LLMs) primarily to support the writing process, including polishing the text for clarity and readability. In addition, LLMs were employed to assist in refining the design of the project website as well as the interface used by annotators.
