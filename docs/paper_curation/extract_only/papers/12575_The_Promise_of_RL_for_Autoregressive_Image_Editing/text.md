#### Abstract

While image generation techniques are now capable of producing high-quality images that respect prompts which span multiple sentences, the task of text-guided image editing remains a challenge. Even edit requests that consist of only a few words often fail to be executed correctly. We explore three strategies to enhance performance on a wide range of image editing tasks: supervised fine-tuning (SFT), reinforcement learning (RL), and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. In order to study all these components in one consistent framework, we adopt an autoregressive multimodal model that processes textual and visual tokens in a unified manner. We find RL combined with a large multi-modal LLM verifier to be the most effective of these strategies. As a result, we release EARL: Editing with Autoregression and RL, a strong RL-based image editing model that performs competitively on a diverse range of edits compared to strong baselines, despite using much less training data. Thus, EARL pushes the frontier of autoregressive multimodal models on image editing. We release our code, training data, and trained models at https://github.com/mair-lab/EARL.

#### 1 Introduction

With internet-scale image-text pairs [41] and diffusion models [40, 39, 23], we have seen impressive progress on open-ended image generation in recent years. At this point, the latest text-to-image models can often adhere to detailed prompts that span several sentences [5, 13]. However, synthesizing images from a prompt alone is often not sufficient for end-users and broader ML applications. In reality, a person might want to alter highly specific details in a given image instead of creating one from scratch. Beyond direct user applications, e.g., in the domains of robotics and planning, one might want to “imagine into the future” with an image editing model acting as a simulator [59, 26, 7], e.g., “how does this scene look like if the robot pushes the mug?”. In both cases, the model must faithfully preserve all details of the original image while modifying the elements intended for editing.

From a capability perspective, most current editing models [61, 8, 56] cover arguably simpler object and attribute edits (replace, change color, add, ...), yet only few works [26, 44] tackle more complex edits that require e.g., action understanding or reasoning (spatial, counting, physical dynamics). From a modeling perspective, a standard recipe to improve editing is to apply supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to a diffusion-based image generation model [8, 61, 56], rarely incorporating more recent posttraining methods such as reinforcement learning (RL). A parallel line of work introduces additional bounding-box conditioning, either explicitly provided by the user [31] or implicitly predicted [16], leaving these methods far from an end-to-end solution. Hence, in this paper we ask: What is the most effective approach to address both simple and complex edits with a unified end-to-end model? And specifically, what are the key learning paradigms that can move the field forward?

39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025).

To this end, we conduct a series of experiments with three different learning paradigms (SFT, RL and chain-of-thought reasoning) and mixes of data. However, diffusion-based models would not directly allow a consistent setup where all training approaches could be plugged in out of the box. For this reason we choose Emu3 [50] as our starting point, a fully autoregressive generative model which was pre-trained on captioning and image generation. Since Emu3 is a unified image and language generation model, we can easily use it to study CoT reasoning and online RL methods such as GRPO [42], on top of SFT. We note that RL for visual generation with diffusion or flow-matching is non-trivial [6, 32]. At the end of our exploration, we arrive at a simple recipe and propose EARL: Editing with Autoregression and RL, a fully autoregressive generative model that trains on simple and complex editing data during the SFT and RL post-training stages. Specifically, we find the combination of GRPO with a strong MLLM-based verifier to be the most effective. While variants of CLIP-Score are more commonly used verifiers [30, 32], they often require finetuning on preferences and lack fine-grained understanding [60, 1]. Instead, we identify large MLLMs with fine-grained understanding such as Qwen2.5-VL-72B as effective verifiers for a broad range of edits.

We empirically show that EARL performs well across many types of edits by evaluating on 6 diverse benchmarks in both IID and OOD settings. We achieve better results than prior state-of-the-art models on the OmniEdit [52], AURORA [26], and VisMin [2] benchmarks. Moreover, our method outperforms the strongest prior work Omnigen [56], despite using five times less data, and also surpasses baselines that use a comparable amount of data, such as AURORA [26]. See Fig. 1 for samples from EARL before and after applying our RL recipe, showing improved performance even on challenging tasks that require spatial understanding. Notably, modeling textual and visual generation as one autoregressive stream has emerged as a new exciting paradigm [50, 45, 46, 55], and we push the frontier of such models for the image editing task, outperforming prior related work EditAR [38]. Finally, we highlight a surprising finding from our in-depth analysis of different training paradigms: teaching the model to explicitly reason about the intermediate steps (chain-of-thought style reasoning) before generating the actual edit does not seem to improve performance, and sometimes it even hurts. Our contributions are as follows:

- 1. We release EARL: A unified end-to-end editing model that performs well on the whole spectrum of edit types.
- 2. EARL outperforms the strongest open-source diffusion baseline (Omnigen [56]), while also outperforming a more comparable fully autoregressive editing model EditAR [38].
- 3. A simple yet effective online RL pipeline for training an autoregressive editing model.
- 4. A systematic analysis of how training objectives interplay and at what stages to bring in simple vs. complex edits. The results interestingly reveal that various CoT reasoning settings do not bring any clear improvements. Our findings also show that complex edits are not beneficial during the SFT stage but are effective in the RL post-training stage.

EARL Recipe: Our results show that autoregressive models, while underexplored for image editing, can be highly competitive. When paired with RL, they surpass strong diffusion-based baselines on both simple and complex edits. This demonstrates the power of combining autoregressive generation with RL for controllable and high-fidelity image editing.

Image Editing Models. Enabled by the development of diffusion models with open-ended textconditioning for image generation [40, 39], image editing models can now receive any text prompt in a similar manner and typically depend on these diffusion models [8, 17]. Research [40, 35] has demonstrated that models such as Stable Diffusion [40] can be zero-shot transformed into an editing model by modifying the sampling procedure [35] or attention maps [22]. To achieve better results, components such as additional input U-Net channels are added to pre-trained image generation models followed by fine-tuning on curated editing data [61, 52, 3]. These training datasets consist of triplets of input image, an edit instruction describing the change, and a ground-truth edited image as output. These triplets rarely occur “naturally” (i.e. only in forums [3]) and therefore need to be sourced from synthetic image generation pipelines [22], human-in-the-loop annotation [61], videos [26, 44], or simulation [26, 36]. Various works also adopt more structure into the editing

- Figure 1: Qualitative comparison between SFT-only and EARL across diverse editing instructions. EARL extends the SFT model by leveraging reinforcement learning to better align image edits with natural language prompts. While both models handle simple edits reasonably well, EARL exhibits clear improvements in precise editing on simple as well as complex edit instructions. Simple edit instructions are shown in blue, and complex edit instructions are shown in pink.

task by restricting the model to edit certain regions of the image [11] or conditioning on bounding boxes or keypoints [37]. In a more recent line of work, image generation is learned jointly with text generation in unified multimodal models that autoregressively predict arbitrary sequences of textual and visual tokens [50, 45]. Concurrent with our work, BAGEL [12] trains a unified transformer model that integrates LLMs and diffusion models, achieving strong editing performance (with and without reasoning) through large-scale pretraining and a powerful base model. However, autoregressive models are less explored for image editing as these models remain less powerful than their diffusion counterparts. Recent work [38] explores using autoregressive models for image editing and achieves competitive results with diffusion baselines. However, they only study the SFT training paradigm, while we study SFT, RL post-training, and CoT Reasoning, cover a wide range of edit types, and outperform their results.

Reasoning in Image Generation. LLM reasoning has been adapted to enhance image generation models through additional conditioning or planning [54]. Models like GLIGEN [31] and LayoutGPT [15] use LLMs to predict bounding boxes and scene layouts to direct object placement before generation. In these works, the layout generation step is unimodal, relying solely on LLMs. However, for image editing tasks, incorporating multimodal information from both the original image and the edit instruction is essential to determine an effective layout. GoT (Generation Chain-of-Thought) [14] applies CoT to visual generation and editing tasks. It first generates reasoning in text, analyzing semantic and spatial relationships in the input image, before generating the edited images using a diffusion model. Additionally, PARM++ [21] introduces a reflection mechanism to self-correct generated images, further enhancing the model’s reasoning capabilities. Another approach focuses on improving the prompts used for image editing by utilizing a large language model (LLM) or a multimodal LLM (MLLM) [17], which is better equipped for both text and image understanding. While previous work has applied reasoning to image editing tasks, our approach systematically explores and evaluates chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in different settings involving both simple and complex edits.

RL for Image Generation. Reinforcement learning has emerged as a powerful tool for finetuning image generation models, particularly diffusion models, to better align with human preferences [6]. Preference-based methods such as Diffusion-DPO [48] and D3PO [57] bypass explicit reward models by directly learning from pairwise human feedback. DDPO [6] further adapts diffusion models

In supervised fine-tuning (SFT), we train an autoregressive model based on the standard image editing setup: triplets of source image, edit instruction, and target image. In SFT with reasoning, the model is supervised to generate chainof-thought (CoT) reasoning traces before generating the final edited image. Finally, we study reinforcement learning (RL) training of the SFT checkpoint, using edit quality verifiers as reward signals.

to hard-to-specify objectives such as aesthetic quality and compressibility, using rewards based on multimodal models (prompt-image alignment). Although RL for image generation is gaining momentum through human preference and multimodal reward signals, its application to image editing remains underexplored. HIVE [63] collects human feedback on edited images to learn reward functions that capture user preferences, but such datasets are costly and difficult to scale. InstructRL4Pix [30] addresses this challenge by using attention-based reward signals for localized, instruction-driven editing. Meanwhile, GRPO has demonstrated stable and efficient training of autoregressive large language models. Concurrent work such as Flow-GRPO [32] and SimpleAR [49] apply GRPO to flow matching and autoregressive models, respectively. Building on this success, we adopt GRPO for unified image editing with the autoregressive Emu3 model [50]. We leverage a strong multimodal model [58] as a reward function, utilizing its robust image-text alignment and zero-shot prompting to specify and evaluate editing preferences effectively.

- 3 Training Paradigms for Autoregressive Image Editing

To our knowledge, EARL is the first to introduce an RL post-training paradigm for autoregressive image editing. While RL-based approaches have recently improved diffusion-based editors, their potential in AR models has remained unexplored. Furthermore, we present the first systematic and controlled comparison of three major training strategies: SFT, RL, and CoT reasoning, within a unified AR framework for image editing. In this section, we formally describe the three training paradigms we explore. All our experiments build upon the Emu3 base model [50] (see Sec. A.1 for more details), a large autoregressive multimodal model that unifies image and text generation in a single autoregressive stream and is trained from scratch.

In the image editing task, the input consists of an original image and a textual edit instruction, and the output is the corresponding edited image. For training Emu3 on the image editing task, both the original and edited images are tokenized into vision tokens using an image tokenizer, while the edit instruction is tokenized into language tokens. These vision and language tokens are then modeled jointly by a single causal transformer (i.e. a LLaMA-style architecture [47]). The task is framed as sequence-to-sequence generation: the model takes as input a token sequence [x1,··· ,xM], formed by concatenating the vision tokens of the input image with the language tokens of the instruction, and generates an output sequence yˆ = [ˆy1,··· ,yˆT], where y = [y1,··· ,yT] represents the ground truth vision tokens of the edited image which is used for teacher forcing. Below, we detail the learning objective for each of the training paradigms we explore ( Fig. 2):

Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) We employ the standard next-token prediction objective to process interleaved image-text sequences. Training minimizes the cross-entropy loss:

L(θ) = −E(x,y)∼D

t

log πθ(yt | y<t,x) ,

where πθ denotes the model and D is the labeled training dataset consisting of edit instructions paired with ground-truth edited images.

Reinforcement Learning (RL) Post-Training We use Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) [42] in our RL pipeline to post-train the model following the initial SFT stage. GRPO initializes a trainable policy model πθ and a frozen reference model from the SFT checkpoint. For a given input prompt x, the model generates a group of G responses y1,y2,...,yG based on the current policy model πθ

. The optimization goal is to maximize the following objective:

Here, Aˆi = (ri − µ)/σ denotes the advantage of response yi, where ri is the reward of the i-th response. µ and σ are the mean and standard deviation of rewards across the response group {yi}.2 The hyperparameters ϵ and β control the clipping range and the Kullback–Leibler (KL) penalty, respectively. To compute the reward ri, we first detokenize the vision tokens in yi back into an image. The reward is then computed using the MLLM verifier, which evaluates the quality of the image editing. This RL objective optimizes the model to generate higher-quality edits while maintaining training stability via the KL divergence term. For a detailed overview of the GRPO method, see the pseudocode in Sec. A.2.

RL Verifier: Any MLLM with strong image understanding capabilities can be used for verification. In particular, we use Qwen2.5-VL-72B [4] as our verifier to evaluate the generated edits based on the following criteria from VIEScore [27]: (1) Edit Success – whether the intended modification was accurately applied; (2) Overedit – whether any unintended changes were introduced; (3) Natural Look – how well the edit blends with the original image; and (4) Artifacts – whether the image contains visual distortions or anomalies. For criteria 1 and 2, the inputs to the model are the edit instruction, input image, and edited image. For criteria 3 and 4, only the edited image is provided. The individual scores are then aggregated into a single reward signal, ranging from 0 to 10.

Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Reasoning Explicitly generating intermediate reasoning steps before the final output is a widely adopted technique that improves performance on complex reasoning tasks [20, 53]. This is known as the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. We extend CoT reasoning to the field of image editing. To teach CoT reasoning to Emu3, we finetune Emu3 with CoT supervision by prepending the response y with a tokenized reasoning chain (see Sec. 4.1 for details of synthesizing ground-truth reasoning traces).

training continues until the reward plateaus. To enhance training stability, we adopt a fully online policy gradient approach, performing a single gradient update at each RL step [25]. All images are resized to 256 × 256 by maintaining their original aspect ratio. Further details on the training setup and compute efficiency are provided in Sec. F.

Training Datasets Our dataset is divided into two categories based on the complexity of the edits: Simple Edits (S) and Complex Edits (C). Simple Edits (S): This category includes relatively simple local edits such as single-object and attribute changes, as well as global edits such as style and environment changes. These types of edits are common in large-scale synthetic datasets, such

- as OmniEdit [52] with 750K samples. Existing models generally perform well on these tasks. Complex Edits (C): These edits involve more advanced operations, including counting, spatial, and action modifications, where current models often struggle. Datasets like Aurora-AG [26], Aurora-Kubric [26], VisMin [2], and Something-Something v2 [19] contain such challenging edits. Additionally, we use real-world edit requests curated with human-in-the-loop guidance, such as Human-Edit [3] and MagicBrush [61], which include complex object/attribute changes. Data in the complex edit category is significantly scarcer, e.g., MagicBrush has 8K samples.

We provide details for each dataset in Tab. 1. Our dataset S comprises 750K OmniEdit samples, while C combines the above mentioned C datasets with 171K unique samples. For datasets in C with fewer than 50K samples, we upsample them to 50K, resulting in a dataset of size 300K for supervised fine-tuning. For RL post-training, we randomly sample from the respective data pool (S or C) at each iteration, using 16 unique samples per step with 8 rollouts per sample. We first experiment with a smaller setup using a pool of 1,600 samples for various ablations. To improve further, we then train with a total of 32K samples over the course of training. This provides more diverse data, allowing the model to benefit from a broader coverage across edit types.

For CoT reasoning supervision, we generate chain-of-thought data using a multimodal large language model (MLLM), Qwen2.5-VL-72B [58], following a prompting strategy similar to [14]. The input to the MLLM consists of standard editing data: an input image, an edited image, a textual edit instruction describing the desired change, and bounding boxes specifying the edit region (if available). For action edits, we also include person keypoints. The generated CoT data follows a step-by-step structure, including a description of the input image, bounding box coordinates of objects to be edited in the input image, bounding boxes of objects to be added in the target image, the edit action, and a description of the final edited image. For complex edit datasets, we apply few-shot prompting to

synthesize CoTs, while for the simple edit dataset (S), we reuse CoTs from [14]. An example is shown in Fig. 3, and our prompting templates and full examples are provided in the Sec. B.2.

##### 4.2 Evaluation Setup

We evaluate on a diverse suite of image editing tasks, ranging from simple object, attribute, and style modifications to complex editing tasks such as counting, actions, and spatial relations.

Evaluation Metric We adopt VIEScore [27] as our metric since it outperforms traditional metrics like LPIPS [62] in terms of human correlation (0.3821 for GPT-4o versus 0.1142 for LPIPS [27]). VIEScore scores edits from 0 to 10 across four criteria (as explained in Sec. 3). For evaluation, we use GPT4o-mini due to its high quality and cost efficiency and confirm that GPT4o-mini variant aligns with human judgment not only on edits from the original human study [27] but also on various complex edits; details are provided in Sec. C. Note that while our metric and reward are both based on VIEScore, we use separate MLLMs for evaluation (GPT4o-mini) and RL verifier (Qwen2.5-VL-72B), to reduce the risk of metric hacking, i.e., overfitting to MLLM-specific biases.

Evaluation Benchmarks We benchmark on datasets covering both simple (OmniEdit [52], EmuEdit [43]) and complex edits (MagicBrush [61], Aurora [26], and I2EBench [34]). EmuEdit and I2EBench serve as out-of-distribution (OOD) evaluations, with I2EBench including unseen edit types such as lowlight enhancement. We also repurpose VisMin [2], originally an image understanding benchmark, into an editing benchmark by generating edit instructions from captions (Sec. B.2.2). These datasets span a wide range of edit types and difficulty levels, enabling robust evaluation. To manage VIEScore API costs, we use a 1000-sample subset for I2EBench and EmuEdit.

Baselines We compare our model to diffusion-based baselines, including MagicBrush [61], InstructPix2Pix [8], Aurora [26], and Omnigen, which is the SOTA image editing model [56]. We also compare with EditAR [38], which, to the best of our knowledge, is the only fully autoregressive image editing model.

#### 5 Results

##### 5.1 Teaching Emu3 Image Editing with Supervised Fine-Tuning

Simple Editing The first row of the Supervised Fine-Tuning section in Tab. 2 presents the results of SFT trained on simple data (SFT (S)). It achieves the highest score on OmniEdit (5.73) and an average score of 3.88, outperforming MagicBrush (3.32) and InstructPix2Pix (3.26), but underperforming Aurora (4.17), EditAR (4.20), and Omnigen (4.70). Notably, Omnigen benefits from a stronger base model with superior image generation performance (GenEval [18] 0.70) and large-scale finetuning (∼ 4M image editing samples). In contrast, our model finetunes from a weaker base model (Emu3, GenEval 0.64) and uses significantly less data (750K image editing samples), resulting in lower overall performance. Also, we see that all models, including Omnigen, perform significantly worse on complex editing benchmarks compared to simple editing benchmarks, highlighting challenges in spatial edits, changes in object count, and human actions. Our trained SFT (S) follows this trend. We next explore how to improve SFT performance on both simple and complex edits.

Complex Editing To improve the ability to handle complex edits, we explore two SFT strategies: joint training on the combined simple and complex edit data (SFT (S+C)) and a two-stage curriculum that first finetunes on simple edits, then on complex edits (SFT (S+C) two-stage). As shown in Tab. 2, joint training (SFT (S+C)) reduces average performance compared to simple-only finetuning (SFT (S)) from 3.88 to 3.32 across both simple and complex editing tasks. In particular, the performance drop is significant on simple edit benchmarks, dropping from 5.73 to 4.64 on OmniEdit and from 3.66 to 2.89 on EmuEdit. We hypothesize that this degradation is due to the large distributional shift between simple and complex edits; mixing them early in training may hinder the model’s ability to generalize across either. In contrast, the two-stage curriculum partially recovers average performance (3.69) and improves results on some complex edit benchmarks (e.g., VisMin, MB). This suggests that allowing the model to first acquire basic editing capabilities from simple data makes subsequent finetuning on complex tasks more effective, especially given that Emu3 has not been exposed to any

editing data during pretraining. Overall, the SFT results show that supervised finetuning is insufficient to effectively learn complex editing tasks.

##### 5.2 Pushing Image Editing with RL Post-training

In this section, we present results showing that RL post-training substantially improves image editing performance. Starting from the SFT (S) model trained only on simple edits, we apply RL post-training under three settings: RL (S), which uses only simple edit data; RL (C), which uses only complex data; and RL (S+C), which uses both. Tab. 2 shows that all RL variants outperform the SFT baseline. RL (C), trained on a disjoint set of complex edits, outperforms RL (S) across all complex (C) benchmarks without a significant drop on simple (S) benchmarks. This contrasts with the SFT setting, where adding complex data degraded simple-edit performance. These results indicate that incorporating complex data during RL helps the model learn complex editing while preserving performance on simple edits. The largest gain comes from balancing simple and complex data, i.e., RL (S+C). The best-performing setup, SFT(S) → RL(S+C), improves the average score from 3.88 to 4.57, surpassing MagicBrush, InstructPix2Pix, Aurora, and EditAR, and remaining competitive with Omnigen. As shown in Tab. 11, even best-of-5 sampling from the SFT model cannot match RL performance, confirming the gains stem from policy optimization. In addition to accuracy, we analyze inference efficiency in Sec. F.2: at 256×256, EARL runs about 4× faster than the SOTA Omnigen with similar quality, while remaining 2× slower than lightweight editors.

Applying RL to models pre-trained on both simple and complex data (SFT (S+C) and two-stage) yields modest gains over SFT, with average scores up to 4.49, still below RL on the simple-only base (SFT (S) → RL (S+C)) . Fig. 4 shows stable RL training of SFT(S) → RL(S+C) with consistent reward improvements and rising VIEScore on OmniEdit, indicating healthy learning dynamics. The two-stage SFT (S+C) → RL (C) variant reaches only 3.48, far below SFT (S) → RL (S). Because SFT (S+C) variants underperform relative to SFT (S), their RL counterparts also remain weaker. We hypothesize that supervised finetuning on complex edits may degrade the base model’s core capabilities, limiting RL’s ability to recover or improve performance. This aligns with findings in LLM research, where base model capability critically influences RL finetuning success [20]. Thus, while complex data is essential, naively including it during SFT can constrain RL’s effectiveness.

Scaling RL Training with More Steps and Data To further improve performance, we scale the best-performing setup: SFT(S) → RL(S+C), by increasing the duration of RL training to 2000 steps and using a larger data pool of 300K (S+C) samples. At each step, 16 unique examples are sampled,

resulting in 32k total samples seen (20× more than the 1.6k samples from earlier runs). This scaled configuration achieves the best overall results and is referred to as EARL in our evaluations. As shown in the last section of Tab. 2, EARL surpasses all baselines (MagicBrush, InstructPix2Pix, Aurora, EditAR, and the SOTA Omnigen), achieving an average score of 4.80 compared to 4.70 for Omnigen. In particular, on OmniEdit, AURORA, and VisMin benchmarks, EARL achieves the best results over prior models. We also achieve strong performance on the out-of-distribution benchmarks like I2EBench and EmuEdit.

Qualitative Analysis of RL Post-training We observe that the SFT model sometimes produces noisy artifacts or over-edits the surrounding regions. It also fails to achieve successful edits consistently. However, when sampled multiple times, at least one output usually satisfies the correct edit (see examples in Fig. 5). Our verifier captures key aspects of edit quality: edit success, over-editing, presence of artifacts, and naturalness, to guide RL training toward more reliable outputs. Qualitative inspection shows artifacts are nearly eliminated, edits are more precise, and success rates improve after applying RL. Fig. 5 illustrates instances where the verifier successfully handles both simple and complex edit tasks. Nevertheless, the reward model is limited by the multimodal image-text understanding of Qwen2.5-VL-72B. For example, in complex edits, such as changing a higher counts (e.g., six to four), the reward becomes less reliable (see Sec. D.1 for more details). This also explains why the performance is higher on simple edits than complex edits in EARL. Importantly, a strong reward model is crucial for effective RL. Our 72B verifier demonstrates significantly better alignment with human judgment than the smaller 7B counterpart (see Sec. D.2 and Sec. D.3). To better assess EARL’s robustness and remaining limitations, we report CLIP similarity and FID metrics in Sec. E.2, provide fine-grained qualitative analyses in Sec. E.5, and include a detailed comparison with the only autoregressive baseline EditAR [38] in Sec. E.3.

We evaluate the effect of incorporating chain-of-thought reasoning supervision on image editing performance. Since Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning involves alternating between generating text and images, it requires interleaved image-text generation. However, our base model Emu3 was not pretrained for this type of multimodal generation, which presents additional challenges.

We compare two SFT variants with CoT reasoning supervision: (1) SFT think (S), and (2) SFT think (S+C) using a two-stage approach. Results in Tab. 3 show that, despite the success of chain-of-thought reasoning in large language models [20], SFT think (S) (3.50 avg.) does not improve visual editing performance compared to SFT (S) (3.88 avg.). We also see that adding complex reasoning data (C) during SFT hurts performance, as shown by the drop in performance in the SFT think (S+C) two-stage setup compared to SFT think (S). This is consistent with Section 5.1, where including complex reasoning data (SFT (S+C)) and the two-stage (SFT (S+C) two-stage) led to performance degradation compared to SFT (S). Next, we apply RL on top of SFT think (S), using the RL(S), RL (C), and RL (S+C) variants. We leave out applying RL on top of SFT think (S+C) two stage as it is too weak. We perform RL post-training for up to 2,000 steps, or until divergence, using 16 unique samples per step. Applying RL on SFT think (S) yields a slight improvement across two settings: RL (S) and RL (S+C). On average, RL (S) improves performance from 3.50 (SFT (S)) to 3.68, while RL (S+C) also improves from 3.50 (SFT (S)) to 3.68. These observations align with findings in the LLM literature. First, CoT reasoning tends to help only once a model surpasses a capability threshold [10, 53]. Second, RL provides limited benefit when the base model is still sub-optimal [33].

Quality of Reasoning Chains The SFT think model generates plausible reasoning: correctly identifies target regions, plans edits, and describes intended outcomes. However, its final outputs often show lower edit accuracy, reduced naturalness, and more artifacts compared to the standard SFT model (see Sec. E.6 for qualitative examples). These results suggest that although the model learns to generate appropriate reasoning, it does not effectively apply it during generation of the edited image. We hypothesize that this limitation is due to the model’s lack of pretraining on interleaved image-textimage data. While the model can generate plausible reasoning chains, it struggles to integrate them effectively for image enhancement, likely because it was not trained to integrate these modalities in a cohesive manner. We leave further exploration of this issue to future work.

#### 6 Conclusion

This work delivers the first systematic comparison of supervised finetuning, reinforcement learning, and CoT reasoning for text-guided image editing within a unified autoregressive framework. Directly motivated by this analysis, we introduce a novel autoregressive image editing model, EARL. EARL performs on par with the strongest open-source baselines while using less data, and sets a new bar for multimodal autoregressive models for editing. While SFT alone proves insufficient for handling complex edits, we find that RL significantly improves performance, enhancing the model’s overall edit success and ability to handle tasks involving spatial reasoning and dynamic interactions. We also address the question of when to introduce complex edits during the various training stages: we found that bringing in complex edits is not helpful during the SFT stage, but is beneficial during the RL post-training stage. Lastly, the CoT reasoning supervision experiment did not lead to consistent improvements, highlighting the need for further research and stronger autoregressive base models with strong reasoning capabilities. We discuss limitations and broader impact of our work in Sec. G.

#### A Background

##### A.1 Emu3

Emu3 [50] (8B parameters) is an autoregressive multimodal model. It extends the LLaMA-2 [47] architecture by integrating a vision tokenizer (SBER-MoVQGAN) for encoding images into discrete tokens and a text tokenizer (QwenTokenizer) for processing textual inputs. Unlike diffusion-based models [56], Emu3 generates text and visual tokens in a unified manner.

In this work, we use the base version of Emu3, which is pre-trained exclusively on text and image data. During pre-training, Emu3 formats image-text multimodal inputs in a structured format (shown below), incorporating special tokens to distinguish between the different modalities:

“[BOS] {caption text} [SOV] {resolution info} [SOT] {vision tokens} [EOV] [EOS]”

where [BOS] and [EOS] mark the beginning and end of the sequence, [SOV] and [EOV] define the boundaries of image metadata such as resolution, image tokens, and [SOT] indicates the start of vision tokens. Additionally, [EOL] and [EOF] are included within vision tokens to denote line and frame breaks, respectively. The resolution info section contains relevant details to image resolution.

Update the policy model πθ by maximizing the GRPO objective ;

Algorithm 1 presents the GRPO algorithm, where we prepare the advantages using the current policy to estimate the gradients. As noted in Sec. 4, we set the backward batch size equal to the rollout batch size, which effectively reduces the second loop to a single iteration. This means policy gradients are estimated in a fully online manner, with advantages always computed from the current policy. This design choice contributes to improved stability during training.

#### B Training Datasets

##### B.1 Dataset Composition

Our goal of building a unified model requires exposure to a wide range of edit types – both simple (e.g., object, attribute, or style changes) and complex (e.g., action changes, counting changes, or spatial relations). No single dataset offers comprehensive coverage of all these edit types, and existing models are typically developed in a fragmented manner, each targeting only a subset of edits.

To address this, we consolidate several existing datasets to form a unified training pool that spans the full spectrum of edit types. OmniEdit [52] serves as our largest source of simple editing examples. For complex edits involving actions, relations, counting, and other real-world applications which are significantly less represented than simple edits – we incorporate data from VisMin [2], Aurora [26], Human-Edit [3], and MagicBrush [61].

##### B.2 Creating Chain-of-Thought from Existing Editing Datasets

This section describes the chain-of-thought datasets for image editing and the associated prompt designs. Image editing datasets typically lack reasoning chains. To address this, we synthesize reasoning chains using a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) through in-context learning (prompting), based on existing resources such as the input image, edited image, and edit instruction. We use Qwen2.5-VL-72B [58] as the MLLM.

In diffusion models, masking is a common form of conditioning. To mimic this, we collect bounding boxes – either by using those provided in the dataset or by estimating them from available masks and pixel differences. These bounding boxes serve as conditioning inputs in the reasoning chain. The model analyzes the image, edit instruction, and target region (via the bounding box) to generate a step-by-step reasoning process, referred to as the thinking field. The system prompt and annotated few-shot examples are provided in Sec. B.2.1 and Sec. B.2.3 respectively.

For VisMin, we use image-text pairs from the VisMin [2] dataset, where the two images differ minimally – making them well-suited for editing tasks. Since examples of complex edits, such as those involving counting or spatial relations, are scarce, repurposing VisMin provides useful coverage for these cases. The change can be inferred from the two image captions, which we use to guide Qwen2.5VL-72B through prompting with few-shot demonstrations. Additional bounding box metadata is used to generate both the edit instruction and the corresponding thinking field, as detailed in Sec. B.2.2.

##### B.2.1 LLM system prompts for creating reasoning chains

}

##### B.2.3 Reasoning chain examples

In the case of the VisMin dataset [2], which contains two minimally changed image-text pairs, we do not receive explicit edit instructions. Instead, we infer these instructions by prompting a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) in a few-shot setting, using both the input and the edited image captions as context. The VisMin dataset covers various categories, including object, attribute, counting, and relationship. For object and attribute categories, where the task typically involves editing a specific region in the image, the target edit region (bounding box) is sufficient to generate the reasoning chain. The model infers the edit instruction by understanding the object and its properties within the defined region. In contrast, the relationship category, which describes spatial changes between objects, requires both the source image coordinates and the edited image coordinates to derive the appropriate edit instruction. For counting tasks, the reasoning chain is created by comparing the source image’s bounding boxes with the removed bounding boxes in the edited image. This allows the model to infer the necessary edit to reflect the changes in object counts. We provide several examples of this process in Sec. B.2.3.

For other image-editing datasets, where edit instructions are explicitly provided, we prompt the MLLM with the input image, edited image, and edit instruction along with bounding box coordinates or keypoints for the objects or persons involved. This structured input allows the model to generate the reasoning chain by clearly understanding both the task and the necessary image modifications. For instance, the reasoning chain might involve identifying objects, spatially manipulating them, or removing them based on the given instructions and bounding boxes. The output reasoning chain provides a step-by-step breakdown of how the image should be edited to achieve the specified changes, ensuring that each instruction is logically followed. We also illustrate this process with further examples in Sec. B.2.3.

} }

#### C VIEScore Alignment with Human Judgment

We use the VIEScore [27] metric as our evaluation metric for the image editing task. VIEScore is based on MLLM prompting to judge the quality of a given edited image w.r.t the given editing prompt and the source image. Specifically, the MLLM is prompted twice, once to judge the semantic quality (alignment with the prompt and overediting), and perceptual quality (such as realism and artifacts). VIEScore was originally only shown to be effective on ImagenHub [28] which contains primarily object- and attribute-centric edits. We verify in Tab. 4 that correlation with human judges is also convincing on various other edit types, i.e., many of the complex edits in this paper such as spatial edits (WhatsUp column), action edits (Something Something, Action-Genome, Epic Kitchen columns) or counting (Kubric column). For this we correlate human judgements initially collected for AURORA-Bench [26] and VIEScore with a GPT4o-mini as a backbone (which we use throughout the

paper as our main metric). We note that human judges in [26] were asked to only judge the semantic alignment and not lower level visual properties such as aesthetics. Thus it is not surprising that the correlation of the semantic component of VIEScore is higher. Overall we find correlations to be on par or sometimes exceeding with those shown in the original paper [27]. For example in the original paper, the overall VIEScore (with the best model GPT4 at the time) had a correlation of 0.382 with human raters on MagicBrush. We find the lowest correlations, as expected, is on hard action-centric prompts in the Epic Kitchen subset of AURORA-Bench.

- Table 4: Correlation between VIEScore (GPT4o-mini) and human judges on the 8 subtasks of AURORA-Bench [26]. Specifically, we correlate the overall VIEScore and the semantic sub-score with humans. We note that human judges in [26] were asked to only judge the semantic alignment and not lower level visual properties such as aesthetics.

- Figure 6: Examples of limitations of the verifier for the complex edits. The reward values correspond to the VIEScore given by our verifier.

Our reward model shows strong performance on simple edits involving object and attribute changes but exhibits limitations when verifying complex edits, as illustrated by several qualitative examples in Fig. 6.

In Row 1, the task is to reduce the number of birds from 10 to 3. This large-count change is difficult for the verifier to handle accurately, reflected in inconsistent scores across different outputs. For instance, although output 2 and 6 are quite similar, the rewards they receive differ significantly (0.0 vs. 4.5). This indicates uncertainty in reliably evaluating edits that involve large numerical changes. In contrast, Row 2 is an example of small count changes. It requires removing all apples except one. The verifier assigns consistently high scores to the correct generations (outputs 3 to 8), suggesting that smaller count changes are easier to verify, likely because the verifier is more exposed to such data during training.

In Row 3, the task involves moving a mouse closer to a remote. Although the model generally assigns higher scores to better samples, it struggles with inconsistencies: in output 8, the mouse’s appearance changes noticeably, and in output 7, the hand shows some distortion. This underscores the difficulty of verifying subtle positional changes compared to simpler edits, such as additions and removals.

For Row 4, the edit requires swapping the positions of a white jeep and a bicycle. The verifier correctly favors outputs that accurately reflect this positional change and exhibit fewer artifacts and distortions, demonstrating sensitivity to spatial relationships and artifacts. For example, outputs 2 and

- 3 still show traces of the car in its original position, indicating both leftover artifacts and a failure to correctly reflect the position swap. However, obtaining fully reliable reward signals for fine-grained spatial relationships still remains challenging.

Finally, Row 5 involves moving a person toward the right side. Although the verifier prefers outputs where the person’s position is more towards the right, it does not take into account the changes in person’s appearance.

It is important to note that while verifier scores vary, the model can still provide meaningful signals for some complex edits such as detecting lower object counts or changes in position to a certain extent, helping guide improvements in edit quality.

##### D.2 VIEScore Evaluation with Qwen2.5-VL-72B and Alignment with Human Judgment

We also report the correlation between Qwen2.5-VL-72B’s judgments (as captured by VIEScore) and human judgments on AURORA-Bench (columns show results for individual subtasks, and “AVERAGE” denotes the aggregate performance). While the absolute correlation values are moderate (around 0.4), they are consistent with those reported in the original VIEScore paper (0.382) [27], which established VIEScore as a reliable automatic evaluation metric. This consistency supports the reliability of Qwen2.5-VL-72B as a verifier. Moreover, the results indicate that Qwen2.5-VL72B performs robustly not only on object- and attribute-centric edits but also on more complex edits such as spatial (WhatsUp) and action (Something-Something, Action-Genome).

Table 5: Correlation results between Qwen judgments and human judgments across different datasets. Although the absolute values are modest, they are comparable to the established VIEScore benchmark.

##### D.3 Impact of Verifier Choice on RL Performance

Our main experiments employ Qwen2.5-VL-72B as the reward model (verifier) for RL post-training. We selected Qwen2.5-VL-72B because of its reliable reward feedback and strong performance on fine-grained vision-language tasks, comparable to GPT-4o. We also explored alternative verifiers to study their effect on reward signal quality and overall training performance. Notably, small-sized multimodal LLMs often produced noisy outputs, particularly in tasks requiring instruction-following and prompt adherence. We tested an instruction-tuned model, Qwen-7B. As shown in Tab. 6, replacing Qwen2.5-VL-72B with Qwen-7B led to a significant drop in performance: from an average score of 3.88 with SFT alone to 2.81 with RL post-training. This highlights that smaller models cannot provide sufficiently accurate or stable feedback for AR-based RL training, underscoring the importance of a strong verifier.

#### E Analysis of Model Outputs

##### E.1 Breakdown of VIEScore

To better quantify model behavior, we show four components of VIEScore: Edit Success and OverEdit, which reflect semantic alignment with editing instructions, and Looks Natural and No Artifact, which capture perceptual quality. Tab. 7 reports these metrics for both the SFT(S) baseline and our best-performing configuration, SFT(S) → RL(S+C). As shown in the AVERAGE column, RL notably improves Edit Success, demonstrating stronger alignment with user instructions, while maintaining comparable performance on OverEdit and preserving perceptual quality in terms of Looks Natural and No Artifact.

- Table 7: Breakdown of VIEScore into four components: Edit Success, OverEdit, Looks Natural, and No Artifact comparing SFT(S) and SFT(S) → RL(S+C) across six benchmarks. Values are reported as SFT(S) / SFT(S) → RL(S+C), with the higher score shown in bold.

E.2 CLIP Similarity and FID Evaluation

To provide a more comprehensive and fair evaluation beyond VIEScore, we further report two widely used metrics: CLIP similarity and FID (Fréchet Inception Distance). These metrics capture complementary aspects of model performance: CLIP similarity measures the semantic consistency between generated and ground-truth edited images (↑ higher is better), while FID quantifies image realism and distributional closeness (↓ lower is better). We observe that EARL achieves competitive performance on both CLIP similarity and FID, remaining within the same range as strong baselines such as Omnigen, Aurora, and EditAR. This demonstrates that EARL preserves semantic alignment and image quality while providing comparable fidelity to existing methods. Results are averaged across three benchmarks: MB, VisMin, and OmniEdit.

- Table 8: CLIP Similarity (ViT-B/32) – Edited Image vs. Ground Truth. Higher scores indicate stronger semantic alignment.

##### E.3 Additional Comparison with EditAR

As EditAR [38] is the only existing autoregressive baseline for image editing, we conduct a more comprehensive comparison with it. Our best-performing setup (SFT(S) → RL(S+C)) achieves an average VIEScore of 4.57, surpassing EditAR’s 4.20 across all benchmarks. EditAR also reports results on PIEBench [24] for image editing. As shown in Tab. 10, EARL outperforms EditAR on five metrics, including Structure Distance score, PSNR, LPIPS [62], MSE, and SIM [51]. On CLIP similarity scores computed using ViT-Large-14 on the whole image (CLIP-W) and on the edited regions (CLIP-E), EARL slightly underperforms compared to EditAR. However, our scores remain comparable to EditAR, demonstrating strong perceptual quality and better background preservation.

##### E.4 Best-of-N Evaluation

We further evaluate model performance under a best-of-N sampling regime to separate the effects of sampling diversity from policy optimization. As shown in Tab. 11, best-of-5 sampling substantially improves SFT results (3.88 → 4.33), indicating significant headroom through better candidate selection. However, the RL-tuned model still outperforms SFT even when both use best-of-5 (4.33 → 4.83), demonstrating that policy optimization contributes improvements beyond what sampling alone can achieve. Moreover, the small gap between RL single-sample and RL best-of-5 (4.57 → 4.83) suggests that the RL policy is already producing high-quality outputs with minimal reliance on sampling, highlighting the effectiveness of our training approach.

##### E.5 Fine-Grained Evaluation of EARL

Qualitative Fig. 7 shows EARL SFT (S) → RL (S+C) performing four types of image edits: counting, action, spatial, and simple; each illustrated by three side-by-side input/output examples. In the counting row, EARL correctly removes one poodle and two toy cars but fails to remove one egg from the third image. In the action row, it successfully takes the white cup out and opens the orange bag in the first two examples, but cannot make the person stand up in the final example. For spatial edits, the model effectively interprets spatial relationships by correctly removing the left fire hydrant and adding a man to the left of the road sign, but it fails to add a picture to the left of the woman in the third example. Finally, in the simple edits row, EARL recolors an alien spaceship pink and successfully erases palm tree with clean backgrounds, but fails to edit the third image and removes the bowling bowl instead of the truck. Overall, these examples highlight the model’s strong potential in performing complex image edits, while also indicating some challenges that remain to be addressed.

Quantative The quantitative results ( Tab. 12 13 14 15 16 17) demonstrate that EARL SFT (S) → RL (S+C) consistently outperforms the baseline SFT (S) across multiple fine-grained editing tasks and datasets. For instance, in Tab. 13 on I2EBench, improvements are evident in counting, direction perception, object manipulation, and style alteration metrics. Similarly, Tab. 14 shows gains in style, attribute modification, environment changes, and object addition/removal on OmniEdit. Tab. 15 further confirms these trends on EmuEdit, with better performance in object addition, background editing, and both global and local changes. Lastly, Tab. 16 highlights improved counting and spatial relation accuracy on VisMin. On AURORA, as shown in Tab. 17, there is no improvement in action edits for EARL SFT (S) → RL (S+C) when compared to SFT (S), mainly because SFT (S) itself was very poor on action edits. Overall, these results underscore the effectiveness of combining SFT with RL for diverse kinds of edit types.

- • Observation: While the reasoning model provides detailed planning and grounding, it sometimes produces inconsistent details—such as mentioning two different brand names (IBM and Makoka)—reflecting a pattern of hallucination in the reasoning process that can reduce visual quality compared to the non-reasoning model.

- Example 3 This example involves transforming a green forested area around a small building into a garden with blooming flowers while keeping the building unchanged.

- • SFT (S): Successfully changes the environment to a blooming garden without reasoning, preserving the building and overall composition.
- • SFT think (S): Uses Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to plan the seasonal transformation carefully, resulting in a well-grounded and detailed edit.
- • Observation: Both models perform the edit well, delivering accurate and natural-looking results.

In summary, the reasoning model can ground and plan edits, but it may sometimes reduce visual quality by introducing artifacts and unnatural details compared to the no-reasoning model.

DeepSpeed ZeRO stage 3 for memory efficiency, with mixed precision enabled using bfloat16 (bf16). We train the model for a maximum of 5 epochs.

For RL training, rewards were computed using VIEScore through a vLLM API server running Qwen2.5-VL-72Bon 4 NVIDIA H100 GPUs. The training was conducted separately on a different server for 2000 steps, with early stopping based on reward plateaus, also using four NVIDIA H100 GPUs.

##### F.2 Training Efficiency Comparison

We compare the training data size, compute resources, and training duration of EARL with existing baselines, as shown in Tab. 18. EARL achieves competitive performance with roughly 5× less image-editing data (752k vs. 4M samples) and significantly fewer GPUs (8 vs. 104) compared to Omnigen [56], demonstrating superior data and training efficiency. Note that the higher GPU demand for Omnigen is expected, as its model is trained from scratch. In contrast, EARL builds on pretrained models, reducing computational requirements. This highlights that EARL offers practical efficiency gains while maintaining strong performance.

##### F.3 Inference Speed Comparison

We integrated EARL with vLLM [29], which enables fast autoregressive decoding through PagedAttention and optimized parallel token generation, significantly reducing latency and improving throughput compared to standard autoregressive decoding. We evaluated inference speed on 50 samples using a single A100L GPU, running all models at a resolution of 256 × 256 (except EditAR, which was trained and tested at 512 × 512). The total times to generate 50 samples were as follows: EARL: 52.7s, EditAR: 66.19s, MagicBrush: 23.6s, InstructPix2Pix: 23.7s, Aurora: 23.7s, and Omnigen: 200s. Compared to Omnigen, EARL is roughly 4× faster while achieving competitive editing performance (see Table 2), demonstrating the benefits of optimized autoregressive generation. Although EARL is about 2× slower than diffusion-based baselines such as MagicBrush, InstructPix2Pix, and Aurora, this trade-off is justified by its significant improvements in editing quality.

#### G Limitations and Broader Impact

##### G.1 Limitations

First, the model’s performance heavily depends on the coverage of our training data. Although we curated a diverse set of simple and complex edit triplets, long-tail concepts such as fine-grained cultural artifacts, specialized scientific diagrams, and underrepresented geographic scenes remain sparsely represented. This limited coverage can lead to brittle behavior when the model encounters out-of-distribution inputs.

Second, our reinforcement learning approach relies on a single frozen vision-language verifier, which, despite being a state-of-the-art MLLM, has inherent limitations. The verifier can be imperfect and it inherits biases from its pretraining corpus. It struggles particularly with verifying complex edit types involving spatial relationships and action changes. Although these edits are underrepresented in the verifier’s training data, qualitative and quantitative analyses indicate that the verifier still provides meaningful learning signals to guide the model.

Lastly, our training data depends on synthetic data generated via diffusion models, which include automatic filtering to reduce noise. However, some noisy examples remain, such as image deformations or outputs that do not accurately reflect the edit instructions, due to imperfections in synthetic data generation. These factors can introduce noise in training. However, some of these can be improved during RL post-training, as RL post-training does not need the ground-truth labels for edited images.

##### G.2 Broader Impact

Positive Impacts Text-guided image editing systems such as our RL-enhanced approach has the potential to amplify human creativity and promote accessibility. By accepting natural language instructions, the model helps lower the barrier for designers, educators, and hobbyists who lack advanced editing expertise, enabling rapid iteration on visual concepts. Beyond direct applications, our RL pipeline offers a way to overcome the requirement of ground-truth edited images.

Potential Negative Impacts While high-fidelity image editing offers many benefits, it also poses risks. Such technology can be misused to create convincing misinformation or deepfakes. Additionally, if the base model or the vision-language verifier contains demographic biases, reinforcement learning may inadvertently amplify these biases. Importantly, our model is developed strictly for research purposes and is intended to advance scientific understanding rather than for deployment in real-world applications. We encourage ongoing efforts to implement safeguards and promote ethical use alongside further development in this area.

#### H Behind the Scenes

We started this project with a clear goal: to build a single, unified model that edits images guided only by text instruction – no user-provided masks, bounding boxes, or conditions. The model itself would reason and plan the edits, generating all necessary guidance on its own. The rationale behind this is that diffusion models – a dominant approach to image editing are typically built with some form of user conditioning to control for faithful editing, and they lack unification – a separate model built for different edit types. We wanted to have a unified model that does all sorts of edits and treats user conditioning as a learnable task via reasoning. To achieve this, we needed a model capable of generating both images and text in one combined sequence, so we searched for an interleaved image-text transformer model.

The first model we found is Meta’s Chameleon model [45], as it fits the criteria well. It had good image generation capabilities, but the model was not open source. So, we pivoted to Anole [9], an open-source variant inspired by Chameleon. We trained Anole to do image editing without any reasoning input (the sanity check one can do). Unfortunately, the results were rough: images suffered from distortion and artifacts, making it clear we needed something stronger.

Then came Emu3 [50]. When it was released, we quickly tested it, fine-tuning with small, complex editing datasets. Results initially fell short – until we added large amounts of simpler, high-quality edit data. This mix showed improvements: the model began handling simplistic edits well; also, some hope for counting, spatial, and even some action edits successfully.

Our main goal is to integrate reasoning to eliminate the need for user-provided conditioning. To this end, we introduced reasoning data – structured “chain of thought” prompts to guide the model’s editing process, as detailed extensively in our paper. Surprisingly, models trained with reasoning mostly underperformed compared to those without it. We tried many variants: changing the data pool, simplifying edit tasks, shortening the chain-of-thought length, and varying training data size, but none made a significant difference. We suspect this gap is due to the base model’s capacity or the quality of the reasoning data. Even feeding ground-truth reasoning directly as input during fine-tuning failed to boost results as much as expected.

One positive result we had with the no-reasoning variant is that we were able to get close to state-ofthe-art. Since RL has been gaining traction lately, we were eager to explore its potential by applying it to our problem, but we needed to build a strong SFT model first. We tested SFT models with generating multiple samples given a fixed prompt. One interesting observation was that at least one of these samples did well on simple edit tasks (e.g., changing object, attribute), and sometimes even a complex one (e.g., changing a count). That flicker of success motivated us to integrate RL on top of SFT-ed models – to push the model towards consistently generating better edits. Compared to our exploration of teaching an autoregressive model editing through reasoning, which was for most part unsuccessful for a long while, RL experiments were more promising early on – clearly moving our interest to go further with the RL route.

This journey has been a rollercoaster of setbacks and great excitement when RL was working consistently. Yet, each experiment deepened our understanding of the delicate balance between

###### data quality, reasoning guidance and RL – bringing us closer to that elusive goal of truly unified, instruction-guided image editing.

#### NeurIPS Paper Checklist

##### 1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper’s contributions and scope?

Answer: [Yes] Justification: The abstract and introduction are the summary of the paper’s contributions. Guidelines:

- • The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper.
- • The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
- • The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
- • It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper.

###### 2. Limitations Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We discuss limitations in the supplementary material. Guidelines:

- • The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
- • The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
- • The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be.
- • The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
- • The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon.
- • The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size.
- • If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness.
- • While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.

##### 3. Theory assumptions and proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: No theoretical results. Guidelines:

- • The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
- • All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and crossreferenced.
- • All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
- • The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide intuition.
- • Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
- • Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.

##### 4. Experimental result reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?

Answer: [Yes] Justification: We provide details about training and implementation in Section 4. Guidelines:

- • The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
- • If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not.
- • If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
- • Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.
- • While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example

- (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm.
- (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.
- (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
- (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

##### 5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material?

Answer: [Yes] Justification: We will release the data and code. Guidelines:

- • The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
- • Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/ public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
- • While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark).
- • The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https: //nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
- • The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
- • The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
- • At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if applicable).
- • Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.

##### 6. Experimental setting/details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results?

Answer: [Yes] Justification: Yes, provided in Section 4. Guidelines:

- • The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
- • The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
- • The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.

##### 7. Experiment statistical significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments?

Answer: [No] Justification: We evaluated our models across six benchmarks, each with around 1000 samples. This large sample size likely leads to low overall variability. Guidelines:

- • The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
- • The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper.
- • The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions).
- • The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
- • The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).

- • It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean.
- • It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified.
- • For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates).
- • If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

##### 8. Experiments compute resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments?

Answer: [Yes] Justification: We discuss it in the supplementary material. Guidelines:

- • The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
- • The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
- • The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
- • The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn’t make it into the paper).

##### 9. Code of ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?

Answer: [Yes] Justification: Yes, we do. Guidelines:

- • The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
- • If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation from the Code of Ethics.
- • The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

##### 10. Broader impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed?

Answer: [Yes] Justification: We discuss broader impact of our work in the supplementary material. Guidelines:

- • The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
- • If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
- • Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.

- • The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.
- • The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
- • If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

##### 11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [No] Justification: We finetune our models on top of pretrained models and our finetuning datasets are all publicly available. Guidelines:

- • The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
- • Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters.
- • Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
- • We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.

##### 12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected?

Answer: [Yes] Justification: We follow protocol. Guidelines:

- • The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
- • The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
- • The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL.
- • The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
- • For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of that source should be provided.
- • If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset.
- • For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.

- • If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the asset’s creators.

##### 13. New assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided alongside the assets?

Answer: [Yes] Justification: We will be releasing well-documented code and data. Guidelines:

- • The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
- • Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations, etc.
- • The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is used.
- • At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.

##### 14. Crowdsourcing and research with human subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)?

Answer: [NA] Justification: Not relevant. Guidelines:

- • The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
- • Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main paper.
- • According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector.

##### 15. Institutional review board (IRB) approvals or equivalent for research with human subjects

Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained?

Answer: [NA] Justification: Not relevant. Guidelines:

- • The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
- • Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state this in the paper.
- • We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for their institution.
- • For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.

##### 16. Declaration of LLM usage

Question: Does the paper describe the usage of LLMs if it is an important, original, or non-standard component of the core methods in this research? Note that if the LLM is used only for writing, editing, or formatting purposes and does not impact the core methodology, scientific rigorousness, or originality of the research, declaration is not required.

Answer: [Yes] Justification: We use LLMs at different stages of training and evaluation as described in Section 4. Guidelines:

- • The answer NA means that the core method development in this research does not involve LLMs as any important, original, or non-standard components.
- • Please refer to our LLM policy (https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2025/LLM) for what should or should not be described.
