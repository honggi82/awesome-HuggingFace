ABSTRACT

Despite their remarkable capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to effectively leverage historical interaction information in dynamic and complex environments. Memory systems enable LLMs to move beyond stateless interactions by introducing persistent information storage, retrieval, and utilization mechanisms. However, existing memory systems often introduce substantial time and computational overhead. To this end, we introduce a new memory system called LightMem, which strikes a balance between the performance and efficiency of memory systems. Inspired by the Atkinson–Shiffrin model of human memory, LightMem organizes memory into three complementary stages. First, cognition-inspired sensory memory rapidly filters irrelevant information through lightweight compression and groups information according to their topics. Next, topic-aware short-term memory consolidates these topic-based groups, organizing and summarizing content for more structured access. Finally, long-term memory with sleep-time update employs an offline procedure that decouples consolidation from online inference. On LONGMEMEVAL and LOCOMO, using GPT and Qwen backbones, LightMem consistently surpasses strong baselines, improving QA accuracy by up to 7.7% / 29.3%, reducing total token usage by up to 38× / 20.9× and API calls by up to 30× / 55.5×, while purely online test-time costs are even lower, achieving up to 106× / 117× token reduction and 159× / 310× fewer API calls. The code is available at https://github.com/zjunlp/LightMem.

1 INTRODUCTION

Memory is fundamental to intelligent agent, enabling the assimilation of prior experiences, contextual cues, and task-specific knowledge that underpin robust reasoning and decision-making (Wang et al., 2024; Behrouz et al., 2024; Du et al., 2025; Zhang et al., 2024). While Large Language Models (LLMs) (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025; Achiam et al., 2023) demonstrate remarkable capabilities across a wide range of tasks, they exhibit significant limitations when engaged in long-context or multiturn interaction scenarios due to fixed context windows and the “lost in the middle” problem (Liu et al., 2024). Memory systems are pivotal for overcoming these limitations, as they allow LLMs to maintain a persistent state across extended interactions. Recent works (Li et al., 2025b; Yang et al., 2024; Chhikara et al., 2025; Kang et al., 2025) address this challenge by building explicit external memory through sequential summarization and long term storage, enabling models to retain and retrieve relevant information over long horizons.

Note that a typical LLM memory system processes raw interaction data into manageable chunks, such as turn- or session-level in dialogue scenarios (Xu et al., 2025; Li et al., 2025a), organizes them into long-term memory (e.g., databases or knowledge graphs) by indexing them into memory units, and continuously updates by adding new information and discarding outdated or conflicting content (Zhong et al., 2024). This enables retrieval of relevant memories, improving coherence, and personalization in long-context, multi-turn scenarios.

Challenges. Despite these advances, as shown in Figure 1, contemporary memory systems still suffer from significant inefficiencies and consistency issues. First, in long interactions (e.g., dialogue scenarios), both user inputs and model responses often contain substantial redundant information (Maharana et al., 2024; Wu et al., 2025). Such information is typically irrelevant to downstream tasks or subsequent memory construction, and in some cases, may even negatively affect the model’s in-context learning capability (Liu et al., 2023; Pan et al., 2025). However, current mainstream memory-related studies generally process the raw information directly without any filtering or refinement, leading to high overhead from noisy or irrelevant data. This inflates token consumption without proportional gains in reasoning quality or coherence. Second, memory construction typically treats each turn in isolation or relies on rigid context-window boundaries, failing to model semantic connections across different turns (Tan et al., 2025). As a result, during subsequent memory item construction, the backbone LLM may generate inaccurate or incomplete item representations due to overly entangled topics or semantics, leading to the loss of crucial contextual details. Third, memory updates and forgetting are usually performed directly during inference and task execution. This tight coupling introduces long test-time latency in long-horizon tasks and prevents deeper, reflective processing of past experiences.

Building Lightweight Memory. Inspired by the efficiency and structure of human memory, we introduce LightMem. In particular, LightMem emulates human memory through three key components: (1) A precompression sensory memory module that filters redundant or low-value tokens from raw input and buffers the distilled content. (2) A topic-aware short-term memory that leverages semantic and topical similarity to dynamically group related utterances into coherent segments. By adaptively determining segment boundaries based on content instead of fixed window sizes, this module produces more concentrated and meaningful memory units. This not only reduces the frequency of memory construction but also enables more precise and efficient retrieval during inference. (3) A sleep-time update mechanism for long-term memory maintenance. New memory entries are initially stored with timestamps to support immediate (“soft”) updates for real-time responsiveness. Later, during designated offline periods (i.e., “sleep”), the system reorganizes, de-duplicates, and abstracts these entries, resolving inconsistencies and strengthening cross-knowledge connections. Crucially, this decouples expensive memory maintenance from real-time inference, enabling reflective, high-fidelity updates without introducing latency. By systematically filtering, organizing, and consolidating relevant information, LightMem substantially reduces computational overhead and API costs while sustaining accurate, coherent reasoning over extended interactions. We detail each component in §3.

Results and Evaluation. On LongMemEval (Wu et al., 2025), LightMem consistently outperforms the strongest baseline, improving accuracy by 2.09%–6.40% with GPT and up to 7.67% with Qwen. In terms of overall efficiency (online + offline), LightMem reduces total token usage by up to 38× for GPT and 21.8× for Qwen, lowers API calls by up to 30× and 17.1×, and accelerates runtime by up to 12.4× and 6.3×, respectively. If considering only online test-time costs, the gains become even larger: LightMem cuts token usage by up to 105.9× (GPT) and 117.1× (Qwen), and reduces API calls by up to 159.4× and 309.9×. On the LoCoMo benchmark (Maharana et al., 2024), LightMem maintains strong advantages, achieving 6.10%–29.29% higher accuracy and substantial efficiency improvements—boosting token efficiency by up to 20.92×, reducing API calls by up to 55.48×, and speeding up runtime by up to 8.21× across GPT and Qwen backbones. Furthermore, case studies in §5.6 show that the offline “sleep-time” consolidation enhances long-term memory reliability, mitigating information loss.

2 PRELIMINARY

- 2.1 CONVENTIONAL MEMORY SYSTEMS FOR LLMS

We describe mainstream memory architectures pipeline in terms of two major stages. (I) Memory Bank Construction. This stage can be further decomposed into three sub-stages: (a) Raw data D are first processed at a chosen level of granularity, D(g) = fseg(D;g),g ∈ {turn,session,topic} in dialog scenario; (b) The segmented data D(g) are then summarized or extracted to generate memory entries, E = fsum(D(g)), which are stored and organized within structural backends such as vector databases or knowledge graphs to enable long-term retention; (c) Many systems incorporate an updating mechanism to mitigate issues such as context conflicts or outdated information, M′ = fupdate(M,R;U), where M denotes the existing memory bank, R represents newly generated memory entries, and U specifies the update or forgetting policy. (II) Retrieval and Usage. When a new user query arrives, the system retrieves relevant entries from the memory bank, integrates them with the query to construct the final prompt, and then invokes the model to produce a response.

- 2.2 LIMITATIONS OF EXISTING LLM MEMORY SYSTEMS

Compared to human memory, current LLM memory systems are burdened by high maintenance costs, mainly due to three limitations: 1) Redundant Sensory Memory. In current systems, fsum() and fgran(;g = topic) are typically executed by calling stronger LLMs. Feeding raw data D directly wastes resources and even weakens in-context learning due to redundancy. A key challenge is to design lightweight mechanisms that pre-compress inputs and apply pre-attention strategies to capture semantic units at different granularities efficiently. 2) Balancing Effectiveness and Efficiency in STM. As shown in Figure 1, when input granularity is fixed, D(g) must pass through the entire pipeline. Excessively fine granularity increases latency and underutilizes STM capacity, whereas overly coarse granularity without semantic constraints or grouping may cause mixed or entangled semantics and topics, leading to inaccurate memory construction and loss of fine-grained details in subsequent processes. This calls for strategies that better balance effectiveness and efficiency in STM. 3) Inefficient LTM Updating. Current fupdate() mechanisms face two main issues: (i) enforcing strict real-time updates at test time incurs significant latency, whereas STM can provide short-term context without immediate LTM updates; (ii) memory banks are updated sequentially due to ordering constraints (read-after-write/write-after-read), rather than being triggered dynamically. These limitations raise a research question: Can we design LLM memory that is both efficient and lightweight, inspired by human memory mechanisms?

- 3 LIGHTMEM ARCHITECTURE

Analogous to the human memory, we design LightMem as shown in Figure 2, which consists of three light modules: Light1 implements an efficient Sensory Memory Module that selectively preserves salient information from raw input (§3.1), Light2 realizes a topic-aware STM Module for transient information processing (§3.2), and Light3 provides an LTM module designed to minimize test time update latency (§3.3) with a sleep time update mechanism. The overall pipeline framework of LightMem, its specific models, and comparisons with other memory frameworks are presented in Appendix A.1. The complexity analysis for LightMem’s efficiency gains is in Section 4.

- 3.1 LIGHT1: COGNITIVE-INSPIRED SENSORY MEMORY

In long horizon interaction scenarios, such as user–assistant dialogues, a large portion of the information is redundant. Therefore, we design a Pre-Compressing Submodule to eliminate redundant tokens, followed by the Topic Segmentation Submodule that forms semantic topic-based segments for following faster and more accurate memory construction.

Pre-Compressing Submodule. This module leverages a compression model θ to eliminate redundant tokens, tailored for compatibility with the downstream memory construction phase:

xˆ = {xi ∈ x | P(retain xi | x;θ) > τ},τ = Percentile({xj},r), Following Xia et al. (2025), we use LLMLingua-2 (Pan et al., 2024b) as our compression model θ. Let x be the raw input tokens, θ the model, and r the compression ratio. The threshold τ is set to

[Figure 2]

- Figure 2: The LightMem architecture. LightMem consists of three modules: a) An efficient Sensory Memory Module, b) a topic aware STM Module, and c) an LTM module updated in sleep time.

the r-th percentile of retention scores, keeping only tokens above τ. For P(retain xi | x), we treat the compression process as a binary token classification task (“retain” or “discard”). For each token

xi in a sequence x, the model θ outputs a logit vector ℓi, and the retention probability is given by:

#### P(retain xi | x;θ) = softmax(ℓi)1,

where the subscript 1 denotes the “retain” class. Tokens with probabilities above a dynamic threshold are included in the compressed sequence. In addition, LightMem can also employ more general generative LLM as the pre-compression model. We further implement a token filtering mechanism based on the cross-entropy between the model’s predicted distribution and the true token labels:

P(retain xi | x;θ) = −

q(xi)log P(xi | x;θ)

xi∈V

where q(xi) denotes the true token label distribution. Tokens with higher conditional entropy under a given context are more uncertain and less predictable, indicating greater informational uniqueness and a more critical role in semantic expression, such distinctive tokens are essential for subsequent memory construction and are therefore retained.

Topic Segmentation Submodule. Existing works indicate that topic-granular input facilitates improved performance in memory systems (Pan et al., 2025; Tan et al., 2025). As shown in Figure 2, LightMem maintains a sensory memory buffer to temporarily store information after precompression. When the accumulated information reaches the buffer’s maximum capacity, a hybrid topic segmentation operation based on attention and similarity is triggered. We use the compression model θ and an embedding model to compute attention matrices and semantic similarities, respectively. We define the final segmentation boundaries as the intersection of attention-based boundaries B1 and similarity-based boundaries B2:

B1 = {k | Mk,k−1 > Mk−1,k−2, Mk,k−1 > Mk+1,k, 1 < k < n}, B2 = k sim(sk−1,sk) < τ,1 ≤ k < n , B = B1 ∩ B2.

Specifically, dialogue scenarios possess natural semantic units, namely the conversational turn. We construct a turn-level attention matrix M ∈ Rn×n. B1 are identified as local maxima in the sequence {Mk,k−1}, i.e., the sub-diagonal elements of M corresponding to attention between consecutive sentences. The detailed process of B1 and illustrative cases are provided in Appendix C.1. To mitigate

attention sinks and dilution in attention-based methods, we compute semantic similarity between adjacent turns near each candidate boundary in B1. Boundaries with similarity below threshold τ form set B2, which helps determine the final topic boundaries B.

- 3.2 LIGHT2: TOPIC-AWARE SHORT-TERM MEMORY

After obtaining individual topic segments, forming an index structure of {topic, message turns}, where message turns = {useri, modeli}. These are first placed into the STM buffer. When the token count in the buffer reaches a preset threshold, we invoke LLM fsum to generate concise summaries of every structure. The final index structure stored in LTM is {topic, {sumi, useri, modeli}}.

sumi = fsum(Si), Si ⊆ {useri,modeli }, Si ̸= ∅, Entryi = {topic, ei := embedding(sumi), useri, modeli },

where Entryi denotes the memory entry to be stored in LTM. Compared with inputting at the granularity of a single turn or session, directly feeding multiple sessions can reduce subsequent API calls but often introduces inaccurate memory entries due to excessive topic mixing, leading to performance degradation. In contrast, topic-constrained input granularity minimizes API calls to the greatest extent while preserving summarization accuracy and maintaining stable system performance.

- 3.3 LIGHT3: LONG-TERM MEMORY WITH SLEEP-TIME UPDATE

Soft Updating at Test Time. At test time, when memory entries arrive, LightMem directly inserts them into LTM with soft updates, thereby decoupling the update process from online inference. Due to real-time updates being converted to direct insertions, interaction latency is significantly reduced. After all entries are inserted or when an update trigger arrives, we compute an update queue for every entry in LTM.

Q(ei) = Topk (ej,sim(vi,vj)) | tj ≥ ti,j ̸= i

:n

,

where ei denotes the i-th memory entry with embedding vi and timestamp ti, sim(·,·) is the similarity function, and Topk{·}:n indicates selecting the top-k most similar candidates, with the update queue Q(ei) length fixed at n. Consistent with existing work, we select the top-k existing memory entries with the highest semantic similarity as potential update sources. On this basis, we further impose the constraint that only entries with later timestamps are allowed to update earlier ones (tj ≥ ti), which is consistent with realistic temporal dynamics. Here, Q(ei) denotes the queue of other entries that may update ei. Since this process involves only similarity retrieval, it is fast and lightweight, and can be executed offline in parallel with online inference.

Offline Parallel Update. LightMem does not simply transfer online update latency to offline phases, it substantially reduces the overall update latency. The online update mechanism in existing memory frameworks enforces sequential updates, leading to a total latency that accumulates with each update. As shown in Figure 2, in LightMem, each memory entry maintains a global update queue, with each queue corresponding to a distinct fupdate operation. Since the update targets are independent across queues, updates can be executed in parallel, thereby greatly reducing the total latency.

- Table 1: Complexity comparison between LightMem and other memory systems. The specific definitions of each symbol are provided in the Appendix A.2.

As shown in Table 4, we consider a dialogue with N turns, each containing on average T tokens. In conventional memory systems, each turn triggers a summarization call, consuming Lsum-in + T + Lsum-out tokens and totaling N(Lsum-in +T +Lsum-out) tokens with N API calls. Each summarization

produces M1 memory entries, a fraction R1 of which retrieve at least one relevant neighbor and trigger an update, resulting in an update-token cost of NM1R1(Lup-in + Lup-out).

In LightMem, each turn is first passed through iterative pre-compression submodule, retaining only rxT tokens after x iterations, and appended to a short-term memory (STM) buffer of capacity th. Summarization is triggered only when the buffer reaches capacity, yielding Nr

th summarization calls, each consuming Lsum-in + th + Lsum-out tokens. Each summarization produces M2 memory entries, but stricter retrieval constraints, including semantic similarity and timestamp filtering, re-

- 5 EXPERIMENTS

- 5.1 EXPERIMENTAL SETUP

Experimental Details. (1) Our experiments adopt a realistic Incremental Dialogue Turn Feeding setting, where the entire dialogue history is fed and processed at the turn level, one turn at a time. This reflects practical scenarios where interactions between user and model is incrementally formed turn by turn. (Hu et al., 2025). (2) For considerations of both efficiency and effectiveness, we employ LLMLingua-2 as our pre-compressor throughout all subsequent experiments. (3) The attention scores for topic segmentation are also obtained using LLMLingua-2, the size of the sensory memory buffer is 512 tokens. All specific models used in this paper, can be found in Table 5.

Datasets & Baseline Methods. We use two well-known datasets, LONGMEMEVAL (Wu et al., 2025) (specifically the LongMemEval-S split) and LOCOMO (Maharana et al., 2024) to evaluate memory ability. We compare LightMem against several representative baselines of conversational memory modeling. ① Full Text, ② Naive RAG, ③ LangMem (LangChain, 2025), ④ A-MEM (Xu et al., 2025), ⑤ MemoryOS (Kang et al., 2025), ⑥ Mem0 (Chhikara et al., 2025). In addition, all methods use GPT-4o-mini, Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct-2507 and GLM-4.6 as the LLM backbones. Details on dataset, baselines, and experimental settings are provided in the Appendix D.

Metrics. We evaluate these methods using both effectiveness and efficiency metrics. For effectiveness, we report Accuracy (ACC), defined as the proportion of correctly answered questions. The evaluation is conducted with GPT-4o-mini as an LLM judge, guided by a detailed evaluation prompt (see Appendix E.1). For efficiency, we focus on tracking the computational costs of the LLM invocations in memory bank construction stage (see Section 2.1), all averaged across the entire dataset, as it is the one tied to the design and implementation differences of memory systems. The retrieval and usage stage is not our focus, because for fair comparison, The fretrieve(), fchat() and number of retrieved entries are same among all methods. As a result, their costs exhibit only minor differences, and this stage is largely orthogonal to the design of memory systems, as shown in the table. Within the memory bank construction stage, only the two sub-processes Summary and Update involve the use of LLMs, fsum/extract() and fupdate(). So for both processes, we report the token consumption from LLM calls, including input tokens, output tokens, and total token usage (in thousands). Additionally, we track API Calls counting the total number of LLM invocations, and Runtime recording the overall execution time for memory bank construction stage.

- 5.2 MAIN RESULTS

As shown in Table 2 and Table 3, LightMem demonstrates superior effectiveness and efficiency on both datasets across both GPT and Qwen backbones. For a fair comparison, all efficiency metrics for LightMem in the following analysis refer to the combined online and offline costs.

LongMemEval. On the LongMemEval benchmark, LightMem consistently outperforms the strongest baseline, A-Mem, in the ACC metric, improving accuracy by 2.09%–6.40% with GPT and

up to 7.67% with Qwen. In terms of efficiency, for GPT, LightMem reduces total token consumption by 10×–38× and API calls by 3.6×–30×; for Qwen, it reduces total tokens by 6.9×–21.8× and API calls by 3.3×–17.1×. Regarding runtime, LightMem achieves 2.9×–12.4× for GPT and 1.6×–6.3× for Qwen speedup over other memory baselines.

If considering only online test-time cost, LightMem shows an even larger efficiency advantage. For GPT, LightMem reduces total token consumption by 31.4×–105.9× and API calls by 17.1×– 159.4×; for Qwen, it reduces total tokens by 30.1×–117.1× and API calls by 24.8×–309.9×.

20.92× improvement in total token efficiency, reduces API calls by 13.29×–39.78×, and accelerates runtime by 2.63×–8.21×. On the Qwen backbone, LightMem maintains its advantage in both effectiveness and efficiency, with 4.41%–29.29% higher ACC, 3.33×–18.02× reduction in total token consumption, 12.96×–55.48× fewer API calls, and 1.18×–5.57× faster runtime.

LightMem achieves superior performance on nearly all metrics and both LLM backbones, while demonstrating robust performance and efficiency on both LongMemEval and LoCoMo, highlighting its generalizability across different models and scenarios.

- 5.3 ANALYSIS OF PRE-COMPRESSING SUBMODULE

Performance and Overhead. LightMem uses an additional model (Pan et al., 2024b; Xia et al., 2025) for pre-compression. We evaluate its performance by randomly sampling 1/5 of LONGMEMEVAL and compressing it at ratios shown in Figure 3(a), then prompting LLMs for in-context QA. When compression ratio r ranges from 50%–80%, compressed and uncompressed performance are comparable, demonstrating LLMs can effectively understand compressed content and validating LightMem’s approach. The submodule is highly efficient, consuming under 2GB of GPU memory with negligible impact on overall runtime.

Impact of r on Performance. As shown in Tables 8 and 9, The optimal r for ACC is dependent on the STM buffer threshold th. For smaller thresholds (th ∈ {0,256}), an r of 0.6 achieves the highest ACC. In contrast, for larger thresholds (th ∈ {512,1024}), a higher retention rate of r = 0.7 performs best. This suggests greater buffer capacity enables effective use of richer, less-compressed information, leveraging LLMs’ advanced long-context processing to mitigate the “lost in the middle” phenomenon. On average, the optimal r for ACC is 0.6, reflecting a trade-off between information compression rate and the quantity of information in the STM buffer. In terms of efficiency, a lower r

- Figure 3: Analysis and Ablation Study of Key Modules. Fig.(a) depicts the QA accuracy when using prompts compressed at different ratios (r) as in-contexts to query the LLM directly. Fig.(b) compares the accuracy of different topic segmentation methods under these varying compression ratios. Fig.(c1) and Fig.(c2) present the ablation study for the topic segmentation module, evaluating its impact on both performance and efficiency for the GPT and Qwen models.

generally leads to higher efficiency, as it triggers the buffer threshold less frequently under the same th, resulting in fewer API calls and lower token consumption.

- 5.4 ANALYSIS OF TOPIC SEGMENTATION SUBMODULE

Segmentation Accuracy. To validate the accuracy of our proposed hybrid topic segmentation method, we compare it with segmentation using only a single granularity: attention-only-based and similarity-only-based segmentation. Since the construction process of the LONGMEMEVAL indicates that different sessions naturally serve as topic boundaries, we directly use them as groundtruth labels. The final accuracy is calculated as the number of correctly identified segmentation points divided by the total number of labels. The results in Figure 3(b) validate the effectiveness of our method: it achieves higher accuracy than both individual segmentation methods across all compression ratios, with an absolute accuracy exceeding 80%.

Ablation Study. As shown in Figure 3(c), removing the topic segmentation submodule slightly improves efficiency but significantly harms accuracy, causing a 6.3% drop for GPT and 5.4% for Qwen. This indicates that the submodule effectively enables models to perceive semantic units in the input, facilitating subsequent memory unit generation.

- 5.5 ANALYSIS OF THE STM THRESHOLD’S IMPACT

As illustrated in the Figure 4, the STM buffer threshold (th) has a distinct but significant impact on both efficiency and performance metrics. A consistent trend is: as th increases, there is a marked improvement in efficiency. In contrast, the effect on QA accuracy is non-monotonic. The optimal threshold for accuracy varies depending on the model and the compression ratio (r), indicating that a larger buffer does not always yield better performance. This highlights a crucial trade-off: while a larger STM threshold is consistently better for reducing computational cost, the ideal setting for maximizing task accuracy requires careful tuning.

- 5.6 ANALYSIS OF SLEEP-TIME UPDATE

Why Soft Updates Work. A primary challenge in designing memory systems is handling updates. While powerful, LLMs can be unreliable when tasked with complex real-time update operations. For instance, when presented with two related but not contradictory pieces of information, an LLM might incorrectly interpret them as a conflict and delete the older memory entry, leading to irreversible information loss. Instead, the optimal operations might be to merge the information or

simply add the new entry. In contrast, LightMem performs only incremental additions through soft updates during test time, which preserves global information and complete semantics.

- 6 RELATED WORK

Hard Prompt Compression for LLMs. Hard prompt compression improves LLM efficiency by removing redundant content from prompts (Li et al., 2025c). Methods recently have evolved from using smaller language models (Jiang et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023; Chuang et al., 2024) to queryaware approaches that preserve task-relevant information (Weston & Sukhbaatar, 2023; Creswell

- et al., 2023; Jiang et al., 2024). Additionally, lightweight bidirectional encoders have demonstrated strong effectiveness and efficiency (Pan et al., 2024a; Liskavets et al., 2025).

Chunking Strategies in RAG Systems. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems rely on chunking extrernal documents into smaller units for retrieval (Lewis et al., 2020; Gao et al., 2023). Existing chunking strategies include rule-based methods creating fixed-size segments (Lewis et al., 2020; Sarthi et al., 2024; Edge et al., 2024; Gutierrez et al., 2024), semantic-based methods grouping content by topic (Qu et al., 2025), and LLM-driven methods leveraging model knowledge for splitting (Pan et al., 2025; Duarte et al., 2024; Zhao et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2025b). However, all of these chunking strategies for RAG systems are tailored to static scenarios, not applicable to dynamic and open-ended environments.

Memory Systems for LLM Agents. Memory systems help LLM agents move beyond stateless interactions to support flexible reasoning and adaptation in complex and changing environments (Liu et al., 2025a; Mei et al., 2025). The earliest and most straightforward approaches store experiences as linear or sequential streams, sometimes enhanced with hierarchical structures (Liang et al., 2023; Park et al., 2023; Packer et al., 2023; Zhong et al., 2024; Salama et al., 2025; Fang et al., 2025). A more structured class of methods represents memories as nodes and their relationships as edges, using trees, graphs, or temporal knowledge structures to support retrieval and update (Rezazadeh et al., 2025; Chhikara et al., 2025; Rasmussen et al., 2025; Xu et al., 2025; Zhang et al., 2025). The latest trend integrates various types of memory, allowing them to interact and synergistically improve overall performance (Kang et al., 2025; Li et al., 2025b; Wang & Chen, 2025; Nan et al., 2025). Overall, existing memory systems for LLM agents have become increasingly complex and capable, leveraging hierarchical, structured, and multi-type memories. However, most focus on maximizing effectiveness, with limited consideration of efficiency. While some recent works (Guo

- et al., 2024; Zhao et al., 2025; Dong et al., 2025) share a similar motivation with our work, they focus on lightweight adaptations of GraphRAG where the corpus is predefined and static.

- 7 CONCLUSION

In this work, we introduced LightMem, a lightweight and efficient memory framework designed to address the significant overhead of memory systems for LLM agents. Inspired by the multi-stage Atkinson-Shiffrin human memory model, LightMem’s architecture effectively filters, organizes, and consolidates information. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that this approach maintains strong task performance while sharply reducing computational costs. In the near future, we plan to accelerate LightMem’s update phase via offline pre-computed KV caches, reducing runtime overhead. We aim to integrate a lightweight knowledge graph memory for explicit multi-hop reasoning and structured retrieval. A multimodal memory extension will enable adaptation to visual, auditory, and textual inputs in embodied and real-world scenarios.

ETHICS STATEMENT

LightMem enhances LLM agents by creating an external memory of user interactions. While this improves agent coherence, it introduces critical ethical challenges. Storing dialogue histories poses inherent risks to user privacy, as conversations may contain sensitive data. The memory can also absorb and perpetuate biases or misinformation from user input, potentially leading to bad agent behavior. Therefore, any deployment of this technology must prioritize robust safeguards. We strongly advocate for strict privacy protocols, such as data anonymization and user consent, as well as mechanisms to mitigate the effects of biased or false memories. Responsible development is essential to ensure these memory-augmented systems are used in a safe and trustworthy manner.

REPRODUCIBILITY STATEMENT

To ensure the reproducibility of this work, we introduce the detailed implementations for LightMem are provided in in Section 3, Appendix C. Additionally, we plan to release our source code in the future to further support reproducibility. These measures are intended to facilitate the verification and replication of our results by other researchers in the field.

- A BACKGROUND DETAILS

- A.1 BACKGROUND ABOUT CURRENT MEMORY SYSTEMS

We describe both the mainstream memory architectures and the LightMem pipeline in terms of two major stages. The first is the memory bank construction stage, which can be further decomposed into the three sub-stages (I), (II), and (III) described in the Section 2.1. The second major stage concerns the usage of the memory system, which consists of retrieval and question answering (QA).

Memory Bank Construction As shown in Table 4, we detail the workflows of the three sub-stages (I), (II), and (III) for naive RAG, prevailing memory systems, and our LightMem. It can be observed that baseline memory systems typically perform their update stage during user–model interaction, which introduces substantial test-time latency. In contrast, LightMem decouples this update process from online interaction, thereby significantly reducing test-time latency. All models involved in these processes are listed in Table 5. As shown, LightMem introduces only one additional model, LLMlingua-2,beyond those used by baseline methods. This model follows a lightweight BERT architecture and requires less than 2GB of GPU memory during inference, rendering its overhead negligible. Moreover, for fairness, the latency introduced by this component is fully accounted for in our reported Runtime metric.

Retrieval and Usage After the memory bank construction stage, we obtain an up-to-date memory bank. When a new user query arrives, the memory system use fretrieve() to retrieve relevant entries from this repository, appends them to the query, and then prompts the chat model fchat() to produce a response.

- R1 / R2 Proportion of summary entries that successfully retrieve at least one relevant memory entry (triggering an update) for Other Memory Systems (R1) and LightMem (R2). Some entries do not retrieve any relevant counterparts and thus do not trigger updates.

- B USAGE OF LLMS

Throughout the preparation of this manuscript, we used LLMs to assist with improving grammar, clarity, and wording in parts of this work. The use of LLMs was limited to language refinement, with all ideas, analyses, and conclusions solely developed by the authors.

- C METHODOLOGY DETAILS

- C.1 TOPIC SEGMENTATION

In this part, we present the construction of the attention matrix, the underlying rationale for topic segmentation, and representative illustrative cases.

We extract only the user sentences from multi-turn dialogues, as they are generally more concise and the assistant’s responses necessarily remain consistent with the user’s theme within the same turn. Moreover, since the maximum input length of the LLMLingua-2 Pan et al. (2024b) model is 512 tokens, the assistant’s often lengthy sentences cannot be effectively accommodated. Therefore, we sequentially store the user sentences into a buffer and segment them, ensuring that as many sentences as possible are preserved while staying within the token limit. As a practical trick, if a sentence becomes empty after compression, we retain its original uncompressed version; if the token length of a sentence still exceeds the maximum limit, we continue to compress it using the LLMLingua-2 model at a 0.5 compression rate until the token length falls below the threshold. To reduce the effect of attention sinks, we mask out the contributions of the first and last three tokens in each sequence and subsequently normalize the remaining attention values. Attention is derived from the higher layers of LLMLingua-2 (layers 8, 9, 10, and 11). For any two sentences, we first compute token-level pairwise attention and average across tokens to obtain the overall attention of one sentence to the target sentence; we then average across the selected layers to obtain a more robust inter-sentence attention score. For each current sentence, the attention scores directed toward all

- Figure 4: Impact of the STM buffer threshold (th) on performance and efficiency across different compression ratios (r). Each radar chart represents a specific configuration of a model (GPT-4omini or Qwen3) and a fixed compression ratio. The axes measure six key metrics: Accuracy (ACC), token consumption (Input, Output, Total), API Calls, and Runtime. To facilitate comparison, all values are normalized for visualization on the chart.

preceding sentences are normalized within the sentence, yielding the final attention matrix. Residual fragments that remain after segmentation are carried over to the beginning of the next buffer for further processing, and this procedure continues iteratively until the dialogue ends.

Based on the attention pattern, we focus on the sequence formed by each sentence’s attention scores relative to its immediately preceding sentence, which directly reflects the continuity of local semantics. Therefore, we take the attention scores from the outermost layer of the attention map. When the attention score at a given position is higher than both its preceding and following positions, it is regarded as a local peak. If a sentence is identified as a peak, we set a segmentation point immediately before this sentence, making the peak sentence the beginning of a new segment. The rationale is that the peak sentence exhibits consistently low attention to all earlier sentences overall and reflects a clear transition from an old topic to a new one, indicating that the identified sentence marks the initiation of a new topic.

[Figure 8]

[Figure 9]

Figure 5: Example of Topic Segment Attention Matrix.

- Figure 5 illustrates three representative examples of reliable segmentation under 50% compression rate. In the first attention map, local peaks in the adjacent-sentence attention sequence appear at positions 5, 8, and 11, where the actual segmentation boundaries lie between sentences 4–5 and 11–12.

In the second attention map, peaks occur at positions 3, 8, 12, and 14, and the actual boundaries are located between sentences 7–8, 11–12, and 13–14. Overall, our method achieves close alignment with the majority of true boundaries while providing finer-grained segmentation. These examples demonstrate that our segmentation approach enables both fine-grained and reliable detection of topic boundaries, thereby validating its effectiveness.

- C.2 CATEGORY-WISE ACCURACY

As summarized in Table 7, retrieval-augmented and memory-centric methods (e.g., A-MEM, Mem0, MemoryOS) generally outperform Full Text on categories that demand information integration or belief revision, such as Temporal, Multi-Session, and Knowledge-Update. In contrast, categories such as Single-User and Single-Assistant, lightweight retrieval like Naive RAG is often competitive and can be the most reliable option, while Single-Preference shows higher variance due to its smaller sample size.

- Table 7: Category-wise Accuracy. Accuracy (%) by method across question types. Parentheses indicate category proportion and sample size. For GPT, LightMem is configured with parameters r = 0.7 and th = 512; for Qwen, LightMem is configured with r = 0.4 and th = 768.

Datasets The LongMemEval dataset (Wu et al., 2025) is designed to benchmark long-term interactive memory in conversational agents. It comprises 500 evaluation questions built upon extended user-assistant dialogues. It has two different versions with different lengths: the LONGMEMEVAL-

- S setting contains approximately 115k tokens per problem, while the LONGMEMEVAL-M setting extends up to 1.5 million tokens across 500 sessions. In our work, we adopt the LONGMEMEVAL-

- S version due to its balance between dialogue length and computational feasibility. The questions are categorized into multiple types: information extraction, multi-session reasoning, knowledge updates, temporal reasoning, and abstention. Overall, the dataset is characterized by extremely long

histories, wide temporal spans, and diverse question types, making it a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating conversational agents’ memory capabilities. During the experiments, five samples from this dataset contained corrupted characters, which caused LightMem’s compression model to fail to run properly. Consequently, LightMem directly discarded these five samples when processing the dataset. However, their accuracy results were uniformly treated as false. The indices of these five samples in the dataset are 74, 183, 278, 351, and 380.

The LOCOMO benchmark targets the evaluation of long-range conversational memory. It features extremely long dialogues, with each conversation spanning roughly 300 turns and around 9K tokens on average. The accompanying questions fall into four categories—Single-hop, Multi-hop, Temporal, and Open-domain—providing a comprehensive assessment of different dimensions of memory in LLMs.

Baselines We compare our approach against several representative baselines of conversational memory modeling. ① LANGMEM (LangChain, 2025): The Langchain’s long-term memory module. ② A-MEM (Xu et al., 2025): Constructs a memory-centric knowledge graph, encoding each interaction as a structured memory note and linking these notes via LLM-driven reasoning. ③ MEMORYOS (Kang et al., 2025): Organizes conversational memory in an OS-inspired hierarchy, structuring interactions into short-term, mid-term, and long-term layers via paging and heat-based updating. ④ MEM0 (Chhikara et al., 2025): Extracts memories from dialogue turns through a combination of global summaries and recent context, maintaining them via LLM-guided operations.

All the experiments are conducted on hardware equipped with 4×NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPUs, dual Intel Xeon Gold 6133 CPUs (40 cores, 80 threads), and 256 GB of RAM.

Standard Tasks (Single-session-user/assistant Multi-session)

I will give you a question, a correct answer, and a response from a model. Please answer yes if the response contains the correct answer. Otherwise, answer no. If the response is equivalent to the correct answer or contains all the intermediate steps to get the correct answer, you should also answer yes. If the response only contains a subset of the information required by the answer, answer no.

Question: {question} Correct Answer: {answer} Model Response: {response} Is the model response correct? Answer yes or no only.

Temporal Reasoning Tasks

I will give you a question, a correct answer, and a response from a model. Please answer yes if the response contains the correct answer. Otherwise, answer no. If the response is equivalent to the correct answer or contains all the intermediate steps to get the correct answer, you should also answer yes. If the response only contains a subset of the information required by the answer, answer no. In addition, do not penalize off-by-one errors for the number of days. If the question asks for the number of days/weeks/months, etc., and the model makes off-by-one errors (e.g., predicting 19 days when the answer is 18), the model’s response is still correct.

Question: {question} Correct Answer: {answer} Model Response: {response} Is the model response correct? Answer yes or no only.

Knowledge Update Tasks

I will give you a question, a correct answer, and a response from a model. Please answer yes if the response contains the correct answer. Otherwise, answer no. If the response contains some previous information along with an updated answer, the response should be considered as correct as long as the updated answer is the required answer.

Question: {question} Correct Answer: {answer} Model Response: {response} Is the model response correct? Answer yes or no only.

Single-session Preference Tasks

I will give you a question, a rubric for desired personalized response, and a response from a model. Please answer yes if the response satisfies the desired response. Otherwise, answer no. The model does not need to reflect all the points in the rubric. The response is correct as long as it recalls and utilizes the user’s personal information correctly.

Question: {question} Rubric: {answer} Model Response: {response} Is the model response correct? Answer yes or no only.

Abstention Tasks

I will give you an unanswerable question, an explanation, and a response from a model. Please answer yes if the model correctly identifies the question as unanswerable. The model could say that the information is incomplete, or some other information is given but the asked information is not.

Question: {question} Explanation: {answer} Model Response: {response} Does the model correctly identify the question as unanswerable? Answer yes or no only.
