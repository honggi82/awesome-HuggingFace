### Abstract

Test-time scaling seeks to improve the reasoning performance of large language models (LLMs) by adding computational resources. A prevalent approach within the field is sampling-based test-time scaling methods, which enhance reasoning by generating multiple reasoning paths for a given input during inference. However, despite its practical success, the theoretical foundations remain underexplored. In this paper, we provide the first theoretical framework for analyzing sampling-based test-time scaling methods, grounded in the perspective of confidence estimation. Based on the framework, we analyze two dominant paradigms: self-consistency and perplexity, and reveal key limitations: self-consistency suffers from high estimation error while perplexity exhibits substantial modeling error and possible degradation of the estimation error convergence. To address these limitations, we introduce RPC, a hybrid method that leverages our theoretical insights through two key components: Perplexity Consistency and Reasoning Pruning. Perplexity Consistency combines the strengths of self-consistency and perplexity, boosting the convergence rate of estimation error from linear to exponential while preserving model error. Reasoning Pruning prevents degradation by eliminating low-probability reasoning paths. Both theoretical analysis and empirical results across seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that RPC has a strong potential for reducing reasoning error. Notably, RPC achieves reasoning performance comparable to self-consistency while not only enhancing confidence reliability but also reducing sampling costs by 50%.

### 1 Introduction

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their remarkable reasoning capabilities across diverse applications, including problem-solving [33, 35], planning [53, 13], and decision-making [45, 48]. Test-time scaling methods [58, 57, 20] can further enhance reasoning performance with additional computation. Among these strategies, the sampling-based test-time scaling method has emerged as a simple yet effective technique. Through generating multiple reasoning paths and selecting the most plausible one through a confidence estimation mechanism, such as self-consistency [57] and perplexity [10], this approach has achieved significant improvements.

The success of sampling-based test-time scaling hinges on accurately estimating the confidence of sampled reasoning paths, facilitating their comparison and enabling the selection of the most plausible answer in the Best-of-N manner [20, 29]. Current confidence estimation approaches can be

categorized into two main types: (i) consistency-based methods, which use pre-defined consistency functions [11] to determine answer confidence, with self-consistency as the primary representative; and (ii) probability-based methods, which utilize scores from either the internal LLM probability [44] or external model [29] to evaluate the confidence of reasoning paths, with perplexity as the leading example. While both have proven effective in practice, a rigorous theoretical understanding remains lacking regarding their underlying mechanisms, inherent limitations, and potential improvements.

This paper addresses this gap by introducing the first theoretical framework for sampling-based test-time scaling methods in LLM reasoning. Within this framework, reasoning error is decomposed into two components: Estimation Error and Model Error. We apply our framework to analyze two representative methods from each category, self-consistency and perplexity, and identify their limitations. Self-consistency, which relies on Monte Carlo estimation, achieves only a linear convergence rate in estimation error, resulting in unsatisfactory performance when the sampling budget is limited. Perplexity utilizes the internal probabilities of LLMs to achieve exponential convergence rates, but they suffer from high model error, which compromises their effectiveness. Moreover, its convergence rate depends on the magnitude of probabilities and deteriorates significantly when probabilities are low. These insights provide guidance for developing improved methods: An optimal approach should simultaneously achieve rapid estimation error convergence while maintaining low model error.

To address the above limitations, we introduce a novel Reasoning-pruning Perplexity Consistency (RPC) method, which consists of two components: Perplexity Consistency and Reasoning Pruning. Perplexity Consistency integrates the internal probability of the LLM into the self-consistency framework, enabling rapid estimation error reduction that transitions from linear to exponential convergence while maintaining low model error. Reasoning Pruning mitigates the degradation issue of estimation error reduction rate when the internal LLM probability magnitude is low by automatically modeling the probability distribution and removing low-probability reasoning paths. Our theoretical analysis shows that RPC achieves both fast estimation error convergence and low model error, offering significant potential to reduce reasoning error. Our empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of RPC on seven benchmark datasets. Specifically, on four mathematical reasoning datasets, RPC reduces the required sampling budget by at least 50% while maintaining the same level of reasoning performance as self-consistency. When using the same sampling budget, RPC achieves an average improvement of 1.29% over existing methods. Additionally, RPC provides confidence estimates that are more closely aligned with the ground truth compared to existing methods.

To summarize, the main contributions of the paper are:

- (1) We propose a theoretical framework that formulates sampling-based test-time scaling in LLM reasoning and decomposes reasoning error into estimation error and model error. This framework enables an analysis of existing techniques, offering guidance for developing improved approaches.
- (2) Based on this framework, we introduce a novel test-time scaling method, RPC, which leverages the internal probability of LLMs within the self-consistency paradigm and removes low-probability reasoning paths, thereby accelerating error reduction and improving reasoning performance.
- (3) Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that RPC achieves rapid estimation error convergence, providing strong potential for reducing reasoning error. Empirical results on seven benchmark datasets show that RPC substantially reduces the required sampling budget, improves reasoning accuracy, and enhances the reliability of confidence estimation.

### 2 Problem and Analysis

In this section, we first formulate the LLM reasoning problem using sampling-based test-time scaling methods. Then, we theoretically decompose the LLM reasoning error into Estimation Error and Model Error, and analyze two representative methods of consistency-based and probability-based methods. Our analysis reveals insights for building an advanced LLM reasoning method.

#### 2.1 Problem Formulation

Given a reasoning problem (x,y), where x represents the input query, and y represents the groundtruth answer. The LLM generates a reasoning path t = (t1,...,tm) by sequentially sampling tokens according to the conditional probability distribution p(ti |x,t<i), where m denotes the length of the

reasoning path. The probability of generating the reasoning path tˆis defined as p(tˆ|x), a.k.a the confidence of the reasoning path tˆ. An extraction function g(·) maps the reasoning path to the final answer yˆ = g(tˆ). We can further extend the probability to the answer yˆ, i.e., the answer confidence, denoted as p(ˆy |x). Take the mathematical reasoning problem as an example, the reasoning path tˆ could be “1 + 1 = 2. The answer is 2.” and the function g(·) extracts the answer from tˆ, resulting in yˆ = g(tˆ) = 2. The reasoning correctness is evaluated by the indicator function I[ˆy = y].

The confidence represents the probability that the reasoning path tˆor answer yˆ is correct, allowing LLMs to select the most reliable solution from multiple candidates in the Best-of-N manner [20, 29]. However, in practice, accessing the confidence for all possible reasoning paths or answers of LLMs is computationally infeasible. Therefore, we typically estimate the confidence by sampling finite n reasoning paths t˜1,...,t˜n from the LLM sampling distribution p(t|x), which yields the estimated confidence pˆ(tˆ|x) or pˆ(ˆy |x) for any reasoning path tˆor answer yˆ.

To measure the reasoning performance of LLMs, we use the squared error [22] to penalize reasoning error of confidence for any single reasoning path tˆor answer yˆ:

Epˆ(tˆ) = E p ˆ(tˆ|x) − I[g(tˆ) = y] 2 , Epˆ(ˆy) = E p ˆ(ˆy |x) − I[ˆy = y] 2 . (1)

where the expectation is taken over all possible combinations of n sampled reasoning paths t˜1,...,t˜n, which are used to estimate the confidence pˆ. For notational clarity and simplicity, we omit the explicit form of expectation here and throughout the remainder of the paper.

In the following analysis, we categorize sampling-based test-time scaling methods into two types based on confidence estimation aspects: consistency-based methods and probability-based methods. Consistency-based methods [62, 71] estimate confidence by evaluating the agreement among different reasoning paths, with self-consistency [57] serving as a representative approach. Probability-based methods [20, 10] estimate confidence using either the internal probability provided by the LLM or the scores from external models, with perplexity [57] being a representative example. Our further analysis is conducted on each representative method.

#### 2.2 Theoretical Analysis

In this section, we theoretically decompose the reasoning error into estimation error and model error. Next, we examine the specific forms of reasoning error for two representative methods, self-consistency (SC) and perplexity (PPL), to provide insights for improved algorithm design.

#### 2.2.1 Reasoning Error Decomposition

Take the reasoning error Epˆ(ˆy) of pˆ(ˆy |x) in Equation 1 as an example, we can decompose the reasoning error into the estimation error and model error as follows.

- Proposition 1 (Error Decomposition). For any input x with ground-truth answer y and any possible answer yˆ, let pˆ(ˆy |x) denote the unbiased estimated confidence of yˆ and p(ˆy |x) denote the ground truth confidence. Then, the reasoning error Epˆ(ˆy) can be divided into two components:

##### + p(ˆy |x) − I[ˆy = y] 2

Epˆ(ˆy) = E p ˆ(ˆy |x) − p(ˆy |x) 2

, (2)

Model Error

Estimation Error

where the expectation is taken over sampled reasoning paths t˜1,...,t˜n for estimating confidence.

- Remark 1. The detailed proof is provided in Appendix A.1. Proposition 1 separates the effect of confidence estimation on reasoning error from the effect of the LLM’s reasoning capability. The Estimation Error depends solely on the sampling size and the confidence estimation strategy, while the Model Error is invariant and determined by the LLM’s reasoning capability. This proposition demonstrates that, apart from the fixed Model Error, which is determined by the LLM’s inherent reasoning capability, the reasoning error is bounded by the Estimation Error. Moreover, this proposition provides insights into two directions for improving LLM reasoning performance: (1) reducing the Estimation Error through larger sampling sizes or more accurate confidence estimation methods, and

(2) reducing the Model Error by enhancing the LLM’s reasoning capabilities or developing more sophisticated and effective confidence metrics.

Next, we analyze two representative methods in sampling-based test-time scaling: self-consistency (SC) from consistency-based methods and perplexity (PPL) from probability-based methods, using our theoretical framework. Below, we adopt a common assumption that LLM sampling follows a Bernoulli distribution [55], allowing us to compute the estimation error for specific methods.

#### 2.2.2 Analysis of Self-Consistency

Self-consistency [60, 1, 4] is the representative method for consistency-based methods, which samples n reasoning paths t˜1,...,t˜n, and estimates the confidence of any yˆ using Monte-Carlo estimation by

1 n

pˆ(SC)(ˆy |x) =

n

I[˜yi = yˆ], y˜i = g(t˜i). (3)

i=1

Then, the reasoning error of SC for a given problem (x,y) and any possible yˆ can be computed by

Epˆ(SC)(ˆy) = E

n

1 n

I[˜yi = yˆ] − I[ˆy = y] 2 . (4)

i=1

Finally, we conduct decomposition on SC to illustrate the key factors affecting the reasoning error.

- Proposition 2 (SC Reasoning Error Decomposition). For any input x with ground-truth answer y, let pˆ(SC)(ˆy |x) denote the estimated probability for any possible answer yˆ by SC. Then, the reasoning error Epˆ(SC)(ˆy) can be divided into two components:

Epˆ(SC)(ˆy) =

1 n

p(ˆy |x)(1 − p(ˆy |x))

Estimation Error

+ p(ˆy |x) − I[ˆy = y] 2

Model Error

.

(5)

- Remark 2. The detailed proof is provided in Appendix A.1. This proposition reveals that the estimation error of SC consists solely of variance since the sampling is unbiased. It decreases only linearly with increasing sample size, which results in substantial reasoning error when sampling is limited. This analysis suggests that a promising direction for improving SC is to develop methods that achieve faster estimation error convergence rates.

2.2.3 Analysis of Perplexity

Perplexity is a representative method for probability-based methods that directly utilizes the internal LLM probability p(tˆ|x) for any reasoning path tˆ. However, since the number of possible reasoning paths is nearly infinite, the ground-truth probability can only be accessed for those paths that are actually sampled. Therefore, the estimated probability of any possible reasoning path tˆis estimated using the unique set of n sampled reasoning paths R = Set t ˜1,...,t˜n .

pˆ(PPL)(tˆ| x) =

p(t˜i |x), if tˆ= t˜i, 0, otherwise.

=

t ˜∈R

I t ˆ= t˜ p(t˜|x). (6)

Similarly, the reasoning error of PPL is denoted as follows, with the following proposition decomposing the reasoning error of PPL.

Epˆ(PPL)(tˆ) = E

 

t ˜∈R

I t ˆ= t˜ p(t˜|x) − I[g(tˆ) = y] 2

 . (7)

- Proposition 3 (PPL Reasoning Error Decomposition). For any given input x with ground-truth answer y, let pˆ(PPL)(tˆ|x) denote the estimated probability of tˆ by PPL method for any possible reasoning path tˆ. Then, the reasoning error Epˆ(PPL)(tˆ) can be divided into two components:

##### + p(tˆ|x) − I[g(tˆ) = y] 2

##### Epˆ(PPL)(tˆ) = (1 − p(tˆ|x))np(tˆ|x)(2I[ˆyi = y] − p(tˆ|x))

.

Consistency Function Confidence Estimation

- Figure 1: Illustration of the RPC approach. The Reasoning Pruning filters out low-probability answers, while the Perplexity Consistency incorporates LLM probabilities into the self-consistency framework, resulting in faster convergence of estimation error.

Remark 3. The detailed proof is provided in Appendix A.1. Compared with SC, the estimation error of PPL decreases exponentially, with the rate depending on the magnitude of ground-truth confidence p(tˆ|x). For reasoning paths that are likely to yield the correct answer (i.e., those with non-negligible confidence), PPL achieves a substantially faster convergence rate. However, for reasoning paths with extremely low confidence, the convergence advantage of PPL degrades. Furthermore, the Model Error of PPL is typically larger than that of SC in practice, and we formally demonstrate this in the ideal case in Appendix 4. This analysis suggests that the degradation issue of Estimation Error and the large Model Error issue are fundamental challenges for improving PPL method.

### 3 Methodology

Based on our theoretical analysis, we identify three fundamental challenges in existing methods: (1) SC suffers from slow Estimation Error convergence, leading to efficiency concerns; (2) PPL exhibits large Model Error, compromising its effectiveness; (3) PPL’s Estimation Error convergence advantage deteriorates significantly for certain cases, resulting in a degradation issue.

To address these challenges, we propose Reasoning-Pruning Perplexity Consistency (RPC), a novel method with two key components. First, we integrate internal LLM probabilities into the selfconsistency framework to create Perplexity Consistency (PC), a confidence estimation function that reduces estimation error efficiently while maintaining low model error, thus addressing the first two challenges with theoretical guarantees. Second, we introduce a Reasoning Pruning (RP) module that resolves the third challenge by systematically filtering out reasoning paths with low probabilities.

#### 3.1 Perplexity Consistency

To address the efficiency and effectiveness challenges simultaneously, we propose PC, which directly leverages the LLM’s prediction probability like PPL, obtaining the benefit of an exponential convergence rate, and also applies the consistency function of SC to minimize the model error. Formally, for the unique set of n sampled reasoning paths R = Set t ˜1,...,t˜n , the estimated probability of any possible answer yˆ is

pˆ(PC)(ˆy |x) =

I[g(t˜) = yˆ]p(t˜|x), (9)

t ˜∈R

which calculates the cumulative probability of all unique reasoning paths t ˜i |t˜i ∈ R and g(t˜i) = yˆ whose answer is yˆ. Therefore, the squared error of PC for any possible answer yˆ is

Epˆ(PC)(ˆy) = E (ˆp(PC)(ˆy |x) − I[ˆy = y])2 . (10) Now, we present the following theorem, which explores the reasoning error decomposition of PC.

Theorem 4 (PC Reasoning Error Decomposition). Assume that k = |{t˜ | g(t˜) = yˆ}| and define α := 1 − k1p(ˆy |x). Then, the reasoning error E(ˆp(PC)) of PC can be divided into two components:

##### +(p(ˆy |x) − I[ˆy = y])2

Epˆ(PC)(ˆy) = αnp(ˆy |x) 2I[ˆy = y] − (1 + αn)p(ˆy |x)

##### .

Model Error

Estimation Error

- Remark 5. The proof is presented in Appendix A.3. The theorem states that PC successfully fuses the strengths of PPL and SC: it achieves the same level of model error as SC while ensuring the similar convergence rate as PPL in the estimation error. Particularly, the convergence rate can be computed as αnp(ˆy |x) = (1 − k1p(ˆy |x))np(ˆy |x), which is exponential.

- Remark 6. The convergence rate is primarily influenced by the magnitude of p(ˆy |x). In most scenarios, it remains exponential, facilitating rapid estimation error reduction. However, when

p(ˆy |x) → 0 and np(ˆy |x) ≪ 1, we only have αn → 1+np1(ˆy|x) [32], resulting in the convergence rate unexpectedly degenerating to a linear result.

#### 3.2 Reasoning Pruning

To address the third degradation challenge, which is also verified in Remark 6, we propose directly pruning these sampled answers, called Reasoning Pruning (RP). The main idea of RP is that an answer with negligible p(ˆy |x) is not likely to be the correct answer, so we may prune it directly without a significant increase in reasoning error. Specifically,RP sets pˆ(ˆy |x) = 0 when the cumulative probability of all its corresponding reasoning paths is lower than a threshold τ, making the estimation error vanish. However, there are two questions raised for RP: (1) Although pruning can boost the estimation error reduction, does it potentially increase the model error and thereby increase the overall reasoning error? (2) How should we determine the threshold τ for pruning?

For the first question, we theoretically prove that RP can achieve the optimal error reduction for each given problem (x,y) with the optimal threshold τ at a high probability.

Theorem 7 (Effectiveness of Reasoning Path Pruning). Assume that the optimal threshold τ = p(y |x), and let kˆ = |{t˜i | g(t˜i) = y,iˆ = 1,...,n}|, which refers to the size of samples whose answer is yˆ. Hence, RP achieves the optimal error reduction with at least the probability 1 − exp − 2kkˆ 2(1 −

τ 1 − α

)2 .

Remark 8. The proof is included in Appendix A.4. The theorem provides a guarantee that RP can achieve the optimal error reduction for each given problem (x,y) at a high probability. Note that the optimal error reduction not only boosts the estimation error reduction efficiency but also effectively reduces the model error, thus improving the final reasoning capability of LLMs.

For the second question, we develop an automated strategy to determine the τ based on the distribution of all sampled reasoning paths. Inspired by open-set recognition [5], we model the probability distribution of Ω1 and Ω2 as a mixture of two Weibull distributions, representing high and low probability regions. Elaborately, we define the PDF of the mixture distribution as:

f(x) = w1fW(x;k1,λ1) + w2fW(x;k2,λ2),

where the Weibull PDF [59] is defined as fW(x;k,λ) = λk λ x k−1 exp −(λx)k . We use the maximum likelihood estimation methods to estimate the parameters, i.e., (k1,λ1), (k2,λ2), w1, and w2 on the probability distribution of all sampled reasoning paths for each reasoning problem. We assume that Weibull(k1,λ1) is the high probability distribution and Weibull(k2,λ2) is the other. Then, the probability of the reasoning path tˆbeing in the high probability distribution is derived by

w1fW(x;k1,λ1) w1fW(x;k1,λ1) + w2fW(x;k2,λ2)

.

PHigh(x) =

where x is the value of LLM internal probability. Then, we remove sampled reasoning paths t˜ satisfying PHigh(ˆp(t˜|x)) < 0.5, which are more likely to be in the low probability distribution. Moreover, to ensure the algorithm’s stability when n is limited, we employ the Truncated Mean method [43], retaining outputs with a probability greater than the overall mean. This prevents the removal of too many reasoning paths due to the potential inaccurate estimation of the mixture distribution.

#### 3.3 RPC Method

Overall, we apply the Reasoning Pruning to all sampled reasoning paths t˜1,...,t˜n for removing low probability reasoning paths and then compute the confidence based on Perplexity Consistency, forming our proposed Reasoning-pruning Perplexity Consistency (RPC) confidence estimation method. The pseudo-code is shown in Algorithm 1 in Appendix B. Figure 1 illustrates its complete framework.

### 4 Experiments

In this section, we conduct experiments to answer the following research questions:

- RQ1: Efficiency. How does RPC reduce the number of samples required to achieve comparable performance through faster convergence?

- RQ2: Efficacy. How does RPC improve reasoning performance compared to existing methods?

- RQ3: Reliability. How does RPC enhance the reliability of confidence estimation compared to existing methods?

Moreover, further discussions are devoted to further demonstrating the effectiveness of RPC.

#### 4.1 Experimental Setting

In this section, we briefly introduce the comparison methods, datasets, and implementation details. Due to space limitations, detailed experimental settings are included in Appendix C.

Comparison Methods. We compare three types of LLM confidences: perplexity confidence [57] (PPL), self-consistency confidence [10] (SC), and verbalized confidence [52] (VERB). The verbalized confidence is computed based on the probability that the LLM outputs “True” versus “False” when asked an “Is-True” question. For code generation tasks, we extracted verbalized confidence scores from the model’s numerical likelihood expressions by prompting the LLM.

Datasets. We introduce four popular benchmarks for math reasoning: MATH [25], MathOdyssey [16], OlympiadBench [23], and AIME [66] (contains problems from 1983 to 2024). As to code generation tasks, we evaluate each method on three benchmarks, i.e., HumanEval [8], MBPP [3], and introductory-level problems of APPS [24].

Implementation Details. For math reasoning tasks, we evaluate the InternLM2-Math-Plus models with 1.8B and 7B parameters [64], as well as the DeepSeekMath-RL 7B model [49]. The consistency function IC is the answer comparison. For code generation tasks, we evaluate the Deepseek-Coder 33B model. The consistency function IC is constructed based on semantic equivalence [42] by clustering code based on given test cases. We set the sample size to n = 128 for the MathOdyssey, OlympiadBench, and AIME datasets and n = 64 for the MATH dataset by default. Each experiment is repeated 10 times with different random seeds, and the average performance is reported. All experiments were conducted on Linux servers with A800 and H800 GPUs.

#### 4.2 Empirical Results

- RQ1: Efficiency. How does RPC reduce the number of samples required to achieve comparable performance through faster convergence?

We evaluate our proposed RPC against the standard self-consistency method using four mathematical benchmark datasets with the InternLM-2-MATH-Plus 7B model. For the MATH dataset, we set the reasoning path size to 64, while we set the number of reasoning paths to 128 for the other datasets with SC. We then record the best performance and minimum sampling requirements for SC. For both

RPC and our Perplexity Consistency module (denoted as PC), we report the minimum number of samples needed to match or exceed the performance of the SC in Table 1.

The results of PC indicate improved convergence rates compared to SC in several cases, while maintaining similar rates in others. These findings support the rapid convergence and degeneration issues of PC in Theorem 4. RPC shows significant efficiency improvements by requiring fewer samples to achieve comparable performance relative to SC. Moreover, the degeneration issues observed in PC are effectively addressed in RPC, validating both the effectiveness of the Reasoning Pruning module and our Theorem 7.

- RQ2: Efficacy. How does RPC improve reasoning performance compared to existing methods?

We evaluate the performance of PC and RPC in Figure 2 across various sample budgets. The results demonstrate that RPC achieves better performance than both PPL (which relies on internal LLM probabilities) and SC (which employs Monte Carlo sampling). The detailed accuracy results, including mean and standard deviation in Table 2 support these findings.

We also analyze the performance of PC separately. The results indicate that PC has a faster convergence rate than SC, which aligns with Theorem 4. The significant performance gains from PC to RPC, as shown in Figure 2a and Figure 2b, validate the effectiveness of the Reasoning Pruning module. This suggests that Reasoning Pruning helps reduce model errors when the LLM exhibits good alignment by eliminating incorrect reasoning paths that carry low LLM probability scores.

- RQ3: Reliability. How does RPC enhance the reliability of confidence estimation compared to existing methods?

To evaluate the reliability of confidence estimation, we analyze the ECE results of RPC and comparison methods in Table 2. ECE measures the difference between predicted probabilities and empirical accuracy, as directly computing estimation error using ground-truth probabilities is virtually impractical. The results demonstrate that our RPC approach achieves lower ECE values and higher accuracy compared to PPL and SC, indicating more reliable confidence estimation. We visualize this improvement through reliability diagrams comparing SC and RPC in Figure 3 on MathOdyssey, which clearly shows the reduced calibration error of RPC.

methods on three code generation benchmarks, as illustrated in Figure 4. The results show that RPC achieves the highest accuracy across all datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness beyond mathematics.

Performance on Additional Reasoning Tasks. To further validate the effectiveness of RPC, we conducted experiments on the GPQA [47] and LogiQA [39] benchmarks using the DeepSeek-R1Distill-Qwen-7B model [21] with 16 samples. The results in Appendix D.5 are consistent with those from both math reasoning and code generation tasks, where RPC outperforms existing methods.

Performance across Model Scales and Architectures. To evaluate the generalization ability of our approaches across different model scales and architectures, we conducted additional experiments using InternLM2-Math-Plus 1.8B and DeepSeek-Math 7B models. The results in Table 3 is consistent with results in Table 2. We additionally report the detailed performance of InternLM2-Math-Plus

Performance using Advanced Methods and Models. To further verify the effectiveness of RPC across diverse scenarios, we conduct additional experiments using the DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B model [21], which is an advanced model with thinking capability. The results in Appendix D.4 demonstrate that the performance gains of RPC persist when combined with advanced models that have strong reasoning performance, highlighting its potential for enhancing LLM reasoning capability. Moreover, we also combine RPC with two advanced methods: ESC [36] and BoN using the reward model [68], which are advanced versions of SC and PPL, respectively. The results in Appendix D.4 show that RPC applied to both methods consistently outperforms the SC and their original versions, demonstrating its strong compatibility for integration with more advanced methods.

Performance using High Sampling Temperatures. As discussed above, sampling more diverse reasoning paths is important for improving reasoning performance. Therefore, we additionally conduct experiments under high sampling temperatures. As shown in Appendix D.1, RPC can further improve reasoning performance under high sampling temperatures by benefiting from the diverse reasoning paths, while the SC may deteriorate due to increased estimation errors at high temperatures.

Discussion about Computational Overhead. We discuss the computational overhead of RPC in Appendix D.7. Theoretically, RPC introduces only minimal computational overhead compared to SC. In practice, the additional computational overhead of RPC is negligible compared to the primary computational bottleneck (i.e., LLM inference time) in reasoning tasks. RPC actually provides an excellent computational trade-off, where the minimal computational overhead is exchanged for significant time savings achieved by reducing the number of required LLM inferences.

Discussion about Hyper-parameters. We provide a detailed discussion of the hyperparameters in Appendix D.6. Overall, RPC introduces the RP module to automatically prune reasoning paths with low probability without requiring manual threshold setting. This makes RPC a hyperparameter-free method that is robust across diverse reasoning tasks.

structured solutions. For complex problems, Least-to-Most [71] introduces a decomposition strategy that breaks down challenges into manageable sub-problems. Few-shot methods [58, 17, 69] leverage carefully selected examples to improve reasoning performance. To enable more comprehensive reasoning, search-based methods [19] integrate Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). Recent advancements have further enhanced MCTS by incorporating reward models [67, 46]. To directly optimize reasoning abilities, researchers have explored fine-tuning approaches [65, 34, 38, 64] using specialized datasets and reinforcement learning techniques [49, 41]. While these methods focus on generating accurate reasoning paths, our RPC can build upon them by utilizing multiple sampling strategies, enabling better reasoning performance. Recent studies recognize its computational issues and propose early stopping [37] and dynamic sampling [56, 54, 2] to improve efficiency. While previous studies primarily focus on developing specific methods that demonstrate empirical effectiveness, our paper introduces a theoretical framework for analyzing them and provides theoretical insights.

LLM Confidence Estimation. The confidence estimation for LLM can be categorized into three types: (1) perplexity confidence, (2) verbalized confidence, and (3) self-consistency confidence. Perplexity confidence [28, 15] utilizes the geometric mean of LLM prediction probabilities (i.e., perplexity [10, 6]) to evaluate model adherence [44] and prompt quality [63]. Verbalized confidence [30, 60, 52] directly asks LLMs to express their confidence through various approaches, such as multi-agent deliberation [61], multi-step evaluation [60], top-k ranking [52], few-shot prompting [40], and reflection [14, 70]. Self-consistency confidence [57, 11, 12, 26, 50] measures the agreement among multiple generated answers to improve reasoning performance, with recent work [60, 1, 4] further developing this approach as a confidence metric. Recent studies have identified that LLM confidence is crucial for enhancing LLM reasoning, such as DeepConf [18], CISC [51], and TTSC [27], which align with our core idea. Our work provides theoretical explanations to support their findings.

### 6 Conclusion

In this paper, we present a theoretical framework for LLM reasoning problem in sampling-based test-time scaling, providing insights and principled guidance for designing better LLM reasoning methods. This framework decomposes LLM reasoning error into estimation error and model error, revealing the efficiency issues of the self-consistency method and effectiveness and degeneration issues of the perplexity method. To this end, we introduce Reasoning-pruning Perplexity Consistency (RPC), which integrates internal LLM probabilities into the self-consistency framework for faster estimation error convergence while maintaining low model error and prunes low-probability reasoning paths to address the degeneration issue. Both theoretical analysis and empirical results demonstrate that RPC achieves superior error convergence, reasoning performance, and confidence reliability.

Limitations and Future Work. Despite our theoretical analysis providing insights and guidance for designing better LLM reasoning methods, this paper presents only a preliminary step toward building advanced reasoning approaches. We believe our theoretical framework can guide future research in this promising direction. Detailed limitations and future works are discussed in Appendix E.

### Broader Impacts

This paper presents a new theoretical framework for analyzing sampling-based test-time scaling methods in LLM reasoning, enabling researchers to identify the limitations of existing methods and to provide insights for developing future approaches. Therefore, we believe that this work has the potential to benefit the broader LLM reasoning community by offering a theoretical foundation. As this paper is a theoretical study, we do not identify negative societal impacts that need to be discussed.

### NeurIPS Paper Checklist

#### 1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper’s contributions and scope?

Answer: [Yes] Justification: We have claimed that our contributions explicitly at the end of introduction section. Guidelines:

- • The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper.
- • The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
- • The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
- • It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper.

###### 2. Limitations Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors? Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We have discussed the limitations at the end of conclusion section as well as in the Appendix E.

Guidelines:

- • The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
- • The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
- • The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be.
- • The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
- • The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon.
- • The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size.
- • If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness.
- • While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.

#### 3. Theory assumptions and proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof?

Answer: [Yes] Justification: We have provided the full set of assumptions in our theoretical results and a complete proof in the Appendix A. Guidelines:

- • The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
- • All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and crossreferenced.
- • All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
- • The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide intuition.
- • Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
- • Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.

#### 4. Experimental result reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: All the necessary information for reproducibility is provided in the subsection 4.1 and Appendix C. Moreover, we provide all necessary information in our project homepage https://wnjxyk.github.io/RPC.

Guidelines:

- • The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
- • If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not.
- • If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
- • Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.
- • While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example

- (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm.
- (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.
- (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
- (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

#### 5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material?

Answer: [Yes] Justification: Yes, the code are provided in our supplementary material. Guidelines:

- • The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
- • Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/ public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
- • While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark).
- • The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https: //nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
- • The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
- • The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
- • At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if applicable).
- • Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.

#### 6. Experimental setting/details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results?

Answer: [Yes] Justification: All the necessary information is provided in Section 4.1 and Appendix C. Guidelines:

- • The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
- • The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
- • The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.

#### 7. Experiment statistical significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments?

Answer: [Yes] Justification: We reported the standard deviation of the experiments in the main paper. Guidelines:

- • The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
- • The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper.
- • The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions).

- • The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
- • The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
- • It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean.
- • It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified.
- • For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates).
- • If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

#### 8. Experiments compute resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments?

Answer: [Yes] Justification: We have provided the details of the compute resources in Appendix C. Guidelines:

- • The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
- • The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
- • The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
- • The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn’t make it into the paper).

#### 9. Code of ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?

Answer: [Yes] Justification: The authors have reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the paper conforms to the code of ethics. Guidelines:

- • The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
- • If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation from the Code of Ethics.
- • The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

#### 10. Broader impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed?

Answer: [Yes] Justification: We have discussed the potential positive and negative societal impacts of our work in the Section 6. Guidelines:

- • The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
- • If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.

- • Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
- • The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.
- • The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
- • If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

#### 11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [NA] Justification: We have not released any models or datasets that have a high risk for misuse. Guidelines:

- • The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
- • Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters.
- • Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
- • We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.

#### 12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected?

Answer: [Yes] Justification: We have properly credited the creators of the assets in our reference. Guidelines:

- • The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
- • The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
- • The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL.
- • The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
- • For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of that source should be provided.
- • If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset.

- • For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
- • If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the asset’s creators.

#### 13. New assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided alongside the assets?

Answer: [NA] Justification: Our paper does not introduce any new assets. Guidelines:

- • The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
- • Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations, etc.
- • The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is used.
- • At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.

#### 14. Crowdsourcing and research with human subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)?

Answer: [NA] Justification: Our paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. Guidelines:

- • The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
- • Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main paper.
- • According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector.

#### 15. Institutional review board (IRB) approvals or equivalent for research with human subjects

Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained?

Answer: [NA] Justification: Our paper does not involve research with human subjects. Guidelines:

- • The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
- • Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state this in the paper.
- • We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for their institution.
- • For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.

#### 16. Declaration of LLM usage

Question: Does the paper describe the usage of LLMs if it is an important, original, or non-standard component of the core methods in this research? Note that if the LLM is used only for writing, editing, or formatting purposes and does not impact the core methodology, scientific rigorousness, or originality of the research, declaration is not required.

Answer: [Yes] Justification: Our algorithm is confidence estimation method based on the sampled LLM reasoning paths. Guidelines:

- • The answer NA means that the core method development in this research does not involve LLMs as any important, original, or non-standard components.
- • Please refer to our LLM policy (https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2025/LLM) for what should or should not be described.

### A Theoretical Results

#### A.1 Proof of Proposition 1, Proposition 2 and Proposition 3

Proof. In this proof, all the expectations are taken over the combinations of n-sampled reasoning paths t˜1,...,t˜n and we omit the details of expectation for simplicity. We first prove the general error decomposition in Proposition 1. Then, we give the proofs of Proposition 2 and Proposition 3. We adopt a common and practical assumption that the LLM sampling can be modeled as sampling from a Bernoulli distribution [55], which allows us to further compute the estimation error for specific methods.

Proof of General Error Decomposition For any input x with ground-truth answer y and any possible answer yˆ, let pˆ(ˆy |x) denote the unbiased estimated confidence of yˆ and p(ˆy |x) denote the ground truth confidence. We have

Epˆ(ˆy) = E p ˆ(ˆy |x) − I[ˆy = y] 2

= E p ˆ(ˆy |x) − p(ˆy |x) + p(ˆy |x) − I[ˆy = y] 2

##### + p(ˆy |x) − I[ˆy = y] 2

= E p ˆ(ˆy |x) − p(ˆy |x) 2

(11)

Model Error

Estimation Error

##### + 2E p ˆ(ˆy |x) − p(ˆy |x) p(ˆy |x) − I[ˆy = y]

Cross Term

Then, we prove the Cross Term is zero for the unbiased confidence function as follows: Cross Term = 2 p(ˆy |x) − I[ˆy = y] · E[ˆp(ˆy |x) − p(ˆy |x)]

= 2 p(ˆy |x) − I[ˆy = y] · 0

= 0

(12)

Therefore, we have the general error decomposition:

Epˆ(ˆy) = E p ˆ(ˆy |x) − p(ˆy |x) 2

Estimation Error

##### + p(ˆy |x) − I[ˆy = y] 2

Model Error

(13)

Proof of Error Decomposition for SC For any input x with ground-truth answer y, let pˆ(SC)(ˆy |x) denote the estimated probability of yˆ by SC method for any possible answer yˆ. The confidence

function of SC is pˆ(SC)(ˆy |x) = n1 ni=1 I[˜yi = yˆi], where y˜1 = g(t˜1),...,y˜n = g(t˜n) and t˜1,...,t˜n are n−sampled reasoning paths from the LLM distribution. Apply the error decomposition, we have

Epˆ(SC)(ˆy) = E p ˆ(SC)(ˆy |x) − p(ˆy |x) 2 + p(ˆy |x) − I[ˆy = y] 2

(14)

1 n

p(ˆy |x)(1 − p(ˆy |x)) + (p(ˆy |x) − I[ˆy = y])2 .

=

Proof of Error Decomposition for PPL Another way is to use the confidence function to build the sampling probability distribution using the unique set of n sampled reasoning paths R = Set t ˜1,...,t˜n , i.e.,

p(t˜i |x), if there is t˜i = tˆ 0, otherwise

pˆ(PPL)(tˆ|x) =

I(t˜= tˆ)p(t˜|x). (15)

=

t ˜∈R

To simplify the analysis, we assume that each t˜1,...,t˜n is different from each other, which is a reasonable assumption in practical LLM reasoning and slightly affects the value of n if this assumption is not satisfied. Then, we have

E p ˆ(PPL)(tˆ|x) − p(tˆ|x) = −(1 − p(tˆ|x))np(tˆ|x) E (ˆp(PPL)(tˆ|x) − p(tˆ|x))2 = (1 − p(tˆ|x))np(tˆ|x)2.

(16)

Hence,

Epˆ(PPL)(tˆ) = E (ˆp(PPL)(tˆ|x) − I[ˆy = y])2

= E (ˆp(PPL)(tˆ|x) − p(tˆ|x) + p(tˆ|x) − I[g(tˆ) = y])2

= −(1 − p(tˆ|x))np(tˆ|x)2 + 2(1 − p(tˆ|x))np(tˆ|x)I[g(tˆ) = y] + (p(tˆ|x) − I[g(tˆ) = y])2

= (1 − p(tˆ|x))np(tˆ|x)(2I[g(tˆ) = y] − p(tˆ|x)) + (p(tˆ|x) − I[g(tˆ) = y])2.

(17) Hence, we complete the proof.

#### A.2 Model Error Comparison in Ideal Case

Proposition 4 (Comparison of Model Errors). Consider a setting with infinite sampling of reasoning paths (n → ∞) where each incorrect reasoning path leads to a unique answer, that is, g(t˜i) ̸= g(t˜j) for any i ̸= j where g(t˜i) ̸= y and g(t˜j) ̸= y. The model error of self-consistency (EModel(SC) ) and perplexity (EModel(PPL)) satisfy:

EModel(SC) ≤ EModel(PPL) (18)

The inequality is strict when the consistency function identifies equivalent correct reasoning paths more than once.

Remark 9. Although the assumptions in Proposition 4 are idealized, this special case demonstrates that the consistency function in self-consistency achieves better model error than the perplexity method. In practice, the perplexity method always gives larger model error compared to the self-consistency method, as it does not leverage the consistency function to analyze the structural properties of specific reasoning problems. The proof is presented as follows.

Proof. We first recall the definitions of the model error for self-consistency and perplexity:

EModel(SC) = y ˆ∈{g(t˜

i)|i=1...n} p ˆ(SC)(ˆy |x) − I[ˆy = y] 2 , EModel(PPL) = t ˆ∈R p ˆ(PPL)(tˆ|x) − I[g(tˆ) = y] 2 .

(19)

where R = Set(t˜1,...,t˜n) is the set of reasoning paths sampled from the LLM. We can compute the difference between the model error of SC and PPL as follows:

EModel(SC) − EModel(PPL) =

p ˆ(SC)(ˆy |x) − I[ˆy = y]

p ˆ(PPL)(tˆ|x) − I[g(tˆ) = y]

(20) Assuming infinite samplings, the unbiasedness of SC gives us:

pˆ(SC)(ˆy |x) =

For any yˆ, consider two cases:

I[g(tˆ) = yˆ] · pˆ(PPL)(tˆ|x). (21)

pˆ(SC)(ˆy |x)2 t ˆ∈R I[g(tˆ) = yˆ] −

t ˆ∈R

I[g(tˆ) = yˆ]

(22) Let pˆ(SC)(ˆy |x)2 = B2 and t ˆ∈R I[g(tˆ) = yˆ] = C, then

(A) ≤ B2 + 1 −

B2 C − C

(C − B2)(1 − C) ≤ 0.

(23)

Equality holds if t ˆ∈R I[g(tˆ) = yˆ] = C = 1. This indicates that (A) < 0 if the consistency function is effective at least once, making t ˆ∈R I[g(tˆ) = yˆ] = C > 1.

- (ii) If yˆ ̸= y, then yˆ is incorrect. Assuming distinct answers for wrong reasoning paths, we have t ˆ∈R I[g(tˆ) = yˆ] = 1, thus

  p ˆ(SC)(ˆy |x) − I[ˆy = y]

 

− p ˆ(SC)(ˆy |x) − I[ˆy = y]

= 0,

since only one tˆ∈ R satisfying that g(tˆ) equals the incorrect answer yˆ.

Therefore, EModel(PPL) − EModel(SC) ≤ 0, indicating that the model error of self-consistency is always less than or equal to the model error of perplexity under our assumptions. Moreover, if the consistency

function is effective at least once, the model error of self-consistency is strictly less than the model error of perplexity.

#### A.3 Proof of Theorem 4

Proof. In this proof, all the expectations are taken over the combinations of n-sampled reasoning paths t˜1,...,t˜n for estimating the confidence pˆ(PC) and we omit the details of expectation for simplicity. To simplify the analysis, we assume that each t˜1,...,t˜n is different from each other, which is a reasonable assumption in practical LLM reasoning and slightly affects the value of n if this assumption is not satisfied. For any given answer yˆ, the estimated probability of PC is pˆ(ˆy |x) = ni=1 I[g(t˜i) = yˆ]p(t˜i |x), allowing the reasoning error of PC can be computed as follows.

Epˆ(PC)(ˆy) = E (ˆp(PC)(ˆy |x) − I[ˆy = y])2

(25)

= E (ˆp(PC)(ˆy |x) − p(ˆy |x) + p(ˆy |x) − I[ˆy = y])2 .

We define k := |{t˜| g(t˜) = yˆ}|, which means that how many reasoning paths whose answers are yˆ can be covered given limited sampling budget. Note that we further have E[I[g(t˜) = yˆ]p(t˜|x)] =

- 1 kp(ˆy |x), thus

n

E[ˆp(PC)(ˆy |x)] = E

I[g(t˜i) = yˆ]p(t˜i |x)

i=1

1 k

p(ˆy |x) n p(ˆy |x)

= 1 − 1 −

= (1 − αn)p(ˆy |x),

where α := k1p(ˆy |x). Again, we have

##### E[ˆp(PC)(ˆy |x) − p(ˆy |x)] = − 1 − α np(ˆy |x)) E[(ˆp(PC)(ˆy |x) − p(ˆy |x))2] = 1 − 1 − α n 1 − α np(ˆy |x))2

(26)

(27)

Hence,

Epˆ(PC)(ˆy) = E (ˆp(PC)(ˆy |x) − I[ˆy = y])2

= E (ˆp(PC)(ˆy |x) − p(ˆy |x) + p(ˆy |x) − I[ˆy = y])2

= (1 − α)np(ˆy |x) 2I[ˆy = y] − (1 + (1 − α)n)p(ˆy |x) + (p(ˆy |x) − I[ˆyi = y])2 ,

(28) which completes the proof.

| |
|---|

- A.4 Proof of Theroem 7 Proof. Let us set the pruning threshold by τ := p(y |x). Then, we have

##### Epˆ(RPC)(ˆy) =αp(ˆy |x) 2I[ˆy = y] − (1 + α)p(ˆy |x) I[(p(ˆy)|x) < τ]

Estimation Error

##### + (p(ˆy |x) − I[ˆyi = y])2 I[(p(ˆy)|x) < τ]

Model Error

(29)

However, we only have an estimation of p(ˆy |x), i.e., pˆ(RPC)(ˆy |x) = kE I[g(t˜) = yˆ]p(t˜|x) ≈

k i=1 p(t˜i |x), where t˜1,...,t˜kˆ are kˆ sampled reasoning paths whose answer is yˆ. Therefore, the

k kˆ

Hence, we only need to consider the probability k1ˆ ki ˆ=1 p(t˜i |x) > m1 τ. Using Hoeffding’s inequality, we can obtain that

### C Detailed Experimental Settings

#### C.1 Datasets

For mathematical reasoning tasks, we evaluate our proposed methods and comparison methods on four mathematical datasets that include MATH, MathOdyssey, OlympiadBench, and AIME datasets.

- • MATH dataset [25] is a dataset comprised of challenging competition math problems and we use its 5,000 testing data for evaluation.
- • MathOdyssey dataset [16] contains 387 problems, covering advanced high-school level, university-level, and Olympiad-level mathematics.
- • OlympiadBench dataset [23] contains 8,476 Olympiad-level mathematics and physics problems. We select the English problems without images, resulting in a testing dataset of 1,284 problems.
- • AIME dataset [66] contains 993 test problems collected from the American Invitational Mathematics Examination, spanning from 1983 to 2024.

For code generation tasks, we conduct experiments on three common benchmark datasets. HumanEval [8] contains 164 hand-written Python programming problems. MBPP [3](sanitized version) consists of 427 entry-level programming problems. We also include the introductory-level problems of APPS [24], which contains 1000 problems.

#### C.2 Detailes of Mathematical Reasoning Task

For all experiments in the main paper, we use a sampling temperature of 1.0 and set the top-p parameter to 0.95. The prompt template follows the recommendation of each LLM.

Prompt for Math Reasoning Tasks. The InternLM2-MATH-Plus 1.8B and 7B models are chat models that facilitate conversations between two roles: “user” and “assistant”. The prompt for the “user” role is provided in Prompt 1. In contrast, the DeepSeek-Math 7B model operates in a non-chat mode, and its corresponding prompt is shown in Prompt 2.

- Prompt 1: Prompt for InternLM-2-Math-Plus

Problem: {instruction} Let’s think step by step Solution:

- Prompt 2: Prompt for DeepSeek-Math

{instruction} Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \boxed{}.

Prompt for Mathematical Verbalized Method. We observed that the tuned math models are challenging to prompt for generating confidence. Therefore, we adopted the methods from [52] to calculate the probability based on the likelihood of the first generated “True” token and the first generated “False” token. The corresponding prompt is provided in Prompt 3.

Prompt 3: Prompt for Mathematical Verbalized Method

Question: {question} Proposed Answer: {answer} Is the proposed answer:

- \t(A) True or
- \t(B) False? The proposed answer is:

#### C.3 Detailes of Code Generation Task

Code Generation. On the code generation task, we let LLM generate a code snippet to solve a given programming problem, and then evaluate its functional correctness based on the ground-truth test cases provided by the dataset. In detail, we set the top p to 0.95, and the max generation length to 1024. For code snippet post-processing, we first extract the code text from the code block surrounded by triple-backticks(“‘), and then we follow [8] to truncate the generated code snippet before the following stop sequences: “\nclass", “\ndef", “\n#", “\nif", “\nprint". At the same time, we also obtain the log-probability of each token from the LLM response. For "verbalization" setting, the verbalized confidence is also extracted from the text generated by LLM along with the code snippet.

Self-consistency on Code. We follow [7] to sample 100 test cases for each programming problem from the same model. Then, we achieved self-consistency in code at the semantic equivalence level, which is based on the execution behavior of any two codes on this set of test cases. More formally, we implemented the consistency function IC(·,·) as an indicator function that indicates whether two codes are semantically equivalent, i.e., IC(x,y) = 1 if and only if code x and y execute the same result on this set of test cases.

Prompt for Generating Code. The prompt for generating code consists of a header, a functional signature, and a docstring and LLM needs to implement the body of this function. An Illustration of has_close_elements problem is shown in Prompt 4.

Prompt for Generating Test Cases. For generating test cases, we implement the function body with a “pass” statement on the basis of the prompt to generate the code, and added a comment to require the LLM to generate test cases for the programming problem. An Illustration of has_close_elements problem is shown in Prompt 5.

- Prompt 4: Prompt for Generating Code

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float],

threshold: float) -> bool: """Check␣if␣in␣given␣list␣of␣numbers ,␣are␣any␣two␣numbers closer␣to␣each␣other␣than␣given␣threshold. """

- Prompt 5: Prompt for Generating Test Cases.

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float],

threshold: float) -> bool: """␣Check␣if␣in␣given␣list␣of␣numbers ,␣are␣any␣two␣numbers closer␣to␣each␣other␣than␣given␣threshold. """

pass # check the correctness of has_close_elements assert

Prompt for Code Verbalized Method. For generating code with verbalized confidence, we add instructions for generating verbalized confidence, as well as format requirements to facilitate the extraction of code and confidence score. We also give a simple example to help LLM understand the format requirements at the end of the prompt. An Illustration of has_close_elements problem is shown in Prompt 6.

Prompt 6: Prompt for Code Verbalized Method

Come up with a solution that solves the following programming question and provide your confidence score in this solution like 0%, 10%, ... 100%.

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float],

threshold: float) -> bool: """Check␣if␣in␣given␣list␣of␣numbers ,␣are␣any␣two␣numbers closer␣to␣each␣other␣than␣given␣threshold. """

Format requirement: output in the form of the following example. Do not provide any additional explanations. Here is an output example: Solution:

### D Detailed Experimental Results

#### D.1 Results under High Sampling Temperature.

Using a high sampling temperature enables LLMs to produce more diverse outputs, potentially enhancing reasoning performance. However, it also leads to an increase in estimation error.

To investigate the effectiveness of our approaches in addressing the estimation error issue, we conducted experiments with higher sampling temperatures (T = 1.1 and T = 1.3) using the InternLM-

- 2-MATH-Plus 7B model. The results in Table 4 indicate that our RPC approach consistently surpasses baseline methods. Notably, a significant performance gap persists between RPC and SC, indicating that RPC effectively tackles the estimation error issue even under sampling high-temperature.

We also report the performance of RPC with different sampling numbers under the high temperature in Figure 5 and Figure 6. The results demonstrate that the RPC method effectively improves the reasoning performance at higher temperatures, as it leverages the increased diversity in sampling to enhance self-consistency. In contrast, the SC method’s performance deteriorates due to increased estimation errors at higher temperatures.

- Table 4: Performance Comparison of different models and different parameter scales. The accuracy is reported as the mean and stdev. The best performance is highlighted in bold. The results show that our RPC approach consistently outperforms existing methods.

#### D.2 Performance with Different Models Scales

In the Figure 2, we plot the accuracy of the InternLM-2-MATH-Plus 7B model on four mathematical reasoning datasets with different sample sizes n. Here, we further investigate the performance of relateively small model, InternLM-2-MATH-Plus 1.8B, is presented in Figure 7. Similar conclusions can be drawn from these results. For the MathOdyssey dataset, the PPL method shows superior performance compared to other methods, which can be attributed to the relatively low model error of PPL on this dataset, allowing the perplexity-based approach to function effectively. Furthermore, the RPC method consistently outperforms the SC method, which demonstrates its ability to enhance the convergence properties of the SC method.

#### D.3 Performance with R1 LLMs

We further investigate the performance of each method using R1 LLMs with thinking capability [9]. Here, we conduct experiments on the DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B model [21] using 16 samples, where the internal probability of LLM is computed only using the response after the “</think>” token.

The results are presented in Table 5. We observe that our RPC method consistently outperforms PPL and SC across all datasets when using R1 LLMs. Moreover, the performance improvements persist even when the base LLM becomes stronger, demonstrating the potential of RPC to improve even stronger LLMs and its generalizability across diverse LLMs.

#### D.4 Performance Comparison with Advanced Methods

In our main paper, we compare RPC with SC and PPL to demonstrate its effectiveness in bridging internal probability and self-consistency, which confirms our theoretical analysis. Here, we further combine RPC with two advanced methods: ESC [36] (an advanced version of SC) and Best-of-N (BoN) using the Qwen2.5-Math-PRM-7B reward model (RM) [68] (an advanced version of PPL that replaces internal probability with rewards from an external reward model) to verify the compatibility of RPC with state-of-the-art methods. Similar to Appendix D.3, we conduct experiments on the DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B model using 16 samples.

As shown in Table 6, RPC using ESC consistently outperforms both SC and ESC across all datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness when adapted to advanced methods. Similarly, the results in Table 7 show that RPC using RM consistently performs better than or comparable to SC and BoN using RM across all datasets. Overall, these experimental results demonstrate that RPC is compatible with state-of-the-art methods and consistently outperforms them across all datasets.

D.5 Performance on Additional Reasoning Tasks

In our main paper, we demonstrate the effectiveness of RPC on both mathematical reasoning and code generation tasks. Here, we further conduct experiments on two additional reasoning tasks: GPQA [47] and LogiQA [39]. GPQA is a multiple-choice benchmark covering biology, physics, and chemistry, while LogiQA is a benchmark testing logical reasoning abilities. Similar to Appendix D.3, we conduct experiments on the DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B model using 16 samples.

As shown in Table 8, we observe that our RPC method consistently outperforms PPL and SC on both datasets. These experimental results demonstrate that the RPC method is generalizable to additional reasoning tasks, showing its strong potential for application to diverse real-world reasoning scenarios.

#### D.6 Explanation on Hyper-parameters

We would like to emphasize that the RPC method introduces a Reasoning Pruning module that can automatically determine the pruning of reasoning paths without manually setting thresholds. Therefore, it avoids sensitivity issues associated with manual threshold setting and makes our RPC a hyperparameter-free method, which is robust across diverse tasks, including mathematical reasoning, code generation, logical reasoning, etc.

Although our RPC method does not explicitly require hyperparameter tuning, the optimization process of the Reasoning Pruning module still involves some parameter configurations, such as initialization and the range of distribution parameters. Therefore, to evaluate the robustness of RPC, we conducted experiments analyzing the impact of different initialization methods and parameter bounds. Specifically, we tested the method with 10 random seeds under various configurations, including different initialization approaches (Fixed Init vs. Zero Init) and different bounds for the distribution parameters w1 and w2. The Fixed Init method and parameter bounds of [0.2,0.8] represent our default optimization settings for RPC. Results presented in Table 9 demonstrate that RPC maintains robust performance across different configurations. Note that these parameter configurations in our method do not require tuning in practical applications.

#### D.7 Explanation on Computational Overhead

In this section, we analyze the computational overhead of RPC compared to SC from both theoretical and practical perspectives.

From a theoretical standpoint, SC requires O(n2) time complexity for answer equivalence computation, where n is the number of samplings. Our RPC method consists of two components: Reasoning Pruning with O(k(m2+n)) time complexity and Perplexity Consistency with O(n2p+np log np+np) time complexity, where m = 5 represents the number of mixture distribution parameters, k denotes the optimization iteration count, and np is the number of reasoning paths after pruning (np ≤ n). The overall complexity simplifies to O(25k + nk + n2p) ≤ O(25k + nk + n2), introducing only minimal computational overhead compared to SC.

From a practical perspective, experiments on MathOdyssey with 128 samplings show that SC takes 0.006s per question while RPC takes 0.036s. Both processing times are negligible compared to the LLM inference time required for sampling multiple reasoning paths. Moreover, RPC’s slight overhead is well-justified by its ability to reduce the required number of samplings while maintaining performance, as demonstrated in Table 1, which addresses the primary computational bottleneck in reasoning tasks.

Overall, RPC provides an excellent computational trade-off, where the computational overhead of RP is exchanged for significant time savings achieved by reducing the number of LLM inferences.

### E Limitations and Future Work

In this paper, we introduce a theoretical framework for analysis the sampling-based test-time scaling methods of LLM reasoning and a new method based on our analyses. While our theoretical framework and approach offer several advantages, there remain some limitations as listed as follows:

- 1. Our theoretical framework is general to analysis sampling-based test-time scaling methods, however, in this paper, we only focus on the analysis on two typical methods as well as RPC.
- 2. Our proposed method is a post-hoc approach that relies solely on the sampled reasoning paths and selects answers from these samples. This design makes the method straightforward to use, as it does not require any modifications to the LLM architecture or its training process. However, the performance improvements are moderate compared to approaches that involve model training. Although integrating our method with trained LLMs may provide additional performance gains, it remains an open question how to utilize our insights to improve the training process of LLMs.
- 3. Current design of our method is relatively simple, which leaves considerable room for improvement. For example, the perplexity consistency component could be extended to include alternative probability measures, such as rewards from a reward model. Furthermore, the reasoning pruning module could be improved by incorporating more advanced techniques to increase its effectiveness.

We also provide the following directions for future work:

- 1. Analyzing Test-Time Scaling Methods: Our paper demonstrates that the theoretical framework is versatile enough to analyze two typical sampling-based test-time scaling methods. It can also be readily extended to evaluate other advanced methods derived from these two types, with strong potential to adapt to various test-time scaling strategies.

- 2. Exploring Advanced Sampling Strategies: Our theoretical results indicate that better convergence requires an effective sampling strategy to sample sufficiently diverse reasoning paths, which is not deeply investigated in this paper. Improved sampling strategies could be designed by drawing inspiration from our theoretical framework.
- 3. Applying to Diverse Reasoning Tasks: In our paper, we show that the Rpc method is effective on math, code, and logical reasoning tasks without exploiting task-specific properties. Task-specific methods could be developed based on our theoretical framework to achieve better performance (e.g., by considering the properties of g(·) in different reasoning tasks).
