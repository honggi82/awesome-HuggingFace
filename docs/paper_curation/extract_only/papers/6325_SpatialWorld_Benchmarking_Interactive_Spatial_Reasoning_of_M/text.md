### Abstract

Spatial reasoning is a foundational capability for multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to perceive and operate within the physical world. However, existing benchmarks predominantly rely on passive evaluation (e.g., static VQA) or simulator-specific pipelines, failing to assess general interactive spatial understanding. We introduce SPATIALWORLD, a unified benchmark designed specifically for evaluating the interactive spatial understanding of multimodal agents in complex real-world tasks. Integrating eight heterogeneous simulation backends under a shared, simulator-agnostic protocol, SPATIALWORLD features 760 humanannotated tasks across diverse domains (e.g., household routines, travel, social collaboration). Agents must solve tasks under vision-only partial observability, actively gathering egocentric visual evidence and expressing decisions via a unified, text-based action interface native to MLLMs. For reliable evaluation, each task includes a human-validated initial state, a reference trajectory, and a terminal-state verifier. Evaluating 15 advanced agents reveals that robust spatial task solving remains challenging: the strongest model, GPT-5, achieves an average task success rate (TSR) of only 17.4%, while the leading open-source model, Qwen-3.5, reaches 14.1%. Further analysis exposes a clear mismatch between task success and execution efficiency, alongside substantial domain-specific performance variations. These bottlenecks in active exploration and long-horizon planning position SPATIALWORLD as a rigorous testbed for future spatial agents.

### 1 Introduction

Spatial reasoning is a foundational capability for multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to perceive, understand, and operate within the physical world [48, 1, 12]. Existing benchmarks for spatial reasoning predominantly adopt a passive evaluation paradigm, such as static Visual Question Answering (VQA) [30, 28, 16, 71, 47] or the understanding of pre-recorded videos [79, 41, 69]. Although these tasks assess the basic understanding of models regarding spatial relations, object layouts, and scene structures, they struggle to capture the interactive and dynamic nature of spatial understanding in real-world environments. Since physical spaces are partially observable, agents cannot acquire complete information from a single view. Instead, they must actively navigate to gather progressive visual evidence, update spatial beliefs [89, 6, 9], and plan subsequent actions.

Therefore, evaluating MLLM spatial reasoning must move beyond static scene recognition to assess their capacity for dynamic exploration and interactive task completion.

Existing embodied benchmarks [54, 80, 11, 35] provide important interactive testbeds for navigation, manipulation, and task execution, yet many of them are designed around simulator-specific embodiments [54, 85, 80], sensor assumptions [53, 34, 35], action interfaces [85, 11, 35, 44], or execution pipelines [54, 85, 80]. This makes it difficult to determine whether task success reflects general interactive spatial reasoning or adaptation to a particular simulator or action space [56]. The rapid progress of general MLLMs therefore raises a different evaluation question: can an off-theshelf multimodal model, without being trained for a specific simulator, solve spatial tasks through egocentric visual observation, language-grounded high-level decisions, and closed-loop interaction across heterogeneous 3D environments? Answering this question requires an evaluation regime with three key properties. First, agents should operate under vision-only partial observability, without relying on additional sensor inputs or privileged state information [53, 34]. Second, the action interface should be native to MLLMs: expressing high-level navigation, viewpoint, interaction, and task-control decisions through a text-based action space enables the model to decompose and solve complex real-world tasks via explicit chain-of-thought reasoning [45]. Third, the protocol should be simulator-agnostic, using a unified interaction interface across environments rather than action designs deeply coupled with a single backend [44, 36, 22]. Such a highly decoupled paradigm eliminates the interference of low-level simulator characteristics, thereby providing a rigorous and faithful evaluation of the model’s capacity for active exploration and decision-making based solely on visual observations and instructions.

To realize this objective, we introduce SPATIALWORLD, a unified benchmark designed specifically for evaluating the interactive spatial understanding of multimodal agents in 3D environments. As summarized in Table 2, SPATIALWORLD contains 760 human-annotated tasks that span household routines, work and study, entertainment, travel, social collaboration, and digital spatial games. These tasks are instantiated across eight simulation backends, including AI2-THOR [32], ProcTHOR [13], VirtualHome [50], CARLA [14], EmbodiedCity [21], their multi-agent variants, and lightweight environments for 3D games. SPATIALWORLD wraps these heterogeneous platforms into a unified end-to-end evaluation framework with shared interfaces for observation, action, and verification. This design allows SPATIALWORLD to diagnose failures across complementary forms of 3D reasoning, rather than reducing the performance of agents to a single score specific to a simulator. By abstracting away the underlying complexities of disparate simulators, this unified architecture enables us to rigorously assess spatial reasoning under constraints that closely mimic real-world interactions. In contrast to prior benchmarks [75, 8, 80], our framework ensures that the performance of agents is evaluated reliably based on perceptual constraints that match tasks in the real world. To guarantee this reliability, each task is paired with an initial-state configuration validated by human annotators, a reference trajectory, and a task-specific terminal-state verifier. These artifacts allow us to measure not only whether an agent reaches the goal state, but also whether this achievement is realized through an efficient and interpretable sequence of actions.

We conduct extensive experiments on SPATIALWORLD with fifteen advanced multimodal agents from both open-source and proprietary model families. Our systematic evaluation reveals three major findings. First, current agents remain far from reliable in solving 3D tasks: across the full benchmark, the strongest model, GPT-5, achieves an average TSR of only 17.4%, while the best open-source model, Qwen-3.5-397B-A17B, reaches 14.1%. Second, there is a clear mismatch between task success and execution efficiency: models with a higher TSR do not necessarily achieve higher efficiency, which suggests that success is often accompanied by redundant exploration or shortcuts dependent on the task. Third, the rankings of models vary substantially across domains: GPT-5 leads daily household, travel, and social collaboration tasks, Qwen-3.5-397B-A17B ties GPT-5 in Work & Study and leads physical entertainment, and Gemini-3.1-Pro achieves the highest scores in digital games. These findings demonstrate that SPATIALWORLD exposes multiple, separable bottlenecks in spatial reasoning, long-horizon planning, and action execution, rather than reducing the evaluation of 3D tasks to a single score on a leaderboard.

### 2 SPATIALWORLD Benchmark

We formalize the task as a vision-only POMDP (§2.1) and present SPATIALWORLD’s distinguishing design principles from existing benchmarks (§2.2). We then describe the system architecture—a

###### 2.1 Task Formulation

Each task in SPATIALWORLD is formulated as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) defined by the tuple ⟨S,O,A,T ,Ω,R⟩. At step t, the agent receives a natural-language goal g and a raw egocentric RGB observation ot ∈ O, strictly without privileged state signals (e.g., depth or global maps). Given the trajectory history Ht = (o1,a1,...,ot), the MLLM-based policy πθ predicts the next high-level action at ∼ πθ(at | Ht,g) ∈ A. The simulator then executes at, transitions the hidden environment state st+1, and renders the next visual observation ot+1:

st+1 ∼ T (st+1 | st,at), ot+1 ∼ Ω(ot+1 | st+1). (1)

This dynamic interaction continues until the agent executes EndTask or exhausts the step budget. By enforcing this strict vision-only, multi-turn formulation, SPATIALWORLD ensures agents must reason under the exact same perceptual conditions as a human operator, distinguishing it from benchmarks that rely on privileged state inputs.

###### 2.2 Benchmark Protocol

To rigorously evaluate the active spatial reasoning capabilities of general MLLMs, we introduce SPATIALWORLD. As shown in Table 1, existing spatial benchmarks typically fall into two categories: static ImageQA/VideoQA datasets that fail to capture dynamic environmental interactions, and simulator-coupled embodied frameworks that rely heavily on non-visual metadata and low-level action parameters. Addressing these limitations, SPATIALWORLD introduces a unified, interactive evaluation paradigm guided by four core design principles: (1) Pure egocentric vision: As highlighted in Table 1, agents receive strictly first-person, vision-only observations without any privileged state information (e.g., ground-truth object coordinates or semantic metadata). This guarantees a genuine evaluation of the coupling between visual perception and spatial reasoning. (2) Cross-platform unification: We abstract simulator-specific complexities into a unified interface

driven by standardized language-form outputs. This enables the direct evaluation of general MLLMs across distinct domains while fully preserving the native physical challenges of each underlying environment. (3) Factored complexity: We systematically decouple photorealistic visual semantics from pure geometric reasoning by incorporating abstract 3D games alongside daily embodied setups. This factorization allows us to pinpoint specific bottlenecks in a model’s spatial cognition without confounding variables. (4) Execution-based verification: Success is objectively verified via terminal environment states rather than strict adherence to predefined action trajectories. This approach accommodates the open-ended exploration and diverse reasoning paths characteristic of autonomous MLLM agents.

###### 2.3 SpatialWorld Architecture

To systematically decouple environment execution from agent decision-making, SPATIALWORLD introduces a modular architecture comprising five standardized components, as illustrated in Fig. 1. In this closed-loop pipeline, the Environment and Verification interfaces rigorously manage task initialization and deterministic success checking, while the Agent Module acts as the central MLLMbased reasoning engine. Crucially, to bridge the gap between diverse simulator backends and a

(b) A unified interface providing standardized egocentric RGB observations. (c) A structured, unified action space A. (d) Action-to-code mapping that translates unified actions into environment-specific commands, enabling cross-simulator deployment.

unified agent policy, the Observation and Action interfaces are designed as a strictly defined I/O bottleneck: they encapsulate all heterogeneous sensory rendering and physics-engine executions into a standardized interaction protocol. As illustrated in Fig. 3, these interfaces serve as a crucial bridge by normalizing complex 3D environments into egocentric visual observations and translating high-level decisions into simulator-specific execution codes. Guided by this architectural abstraction, we next formally detail the unified observation and action spaces exposed to the agent.

Observation Space. At each step, the agent receives a single egocentric RGB screenshot at the simulator’s native resolution. No auxiliary modality (e.g., depth map, optical flow, semantic segmentation, or global occupancy map) is available. This vision-only constraint is the primary departure from VLA-style benchmarks, which typically inject privileged sensor states (joint angles, object lists, navigation graphs) alongside visual input, and from offline 3D benchmarks, which supply pre-captured multi-view scans or videos rather than requiring active information gathering.

Action Space. Rather than requiring low-level continuous motor commands (e.g., joint torques or velocity vectors), we expose a unified high-level action space A that abstracts heterogeneous simulator backends behind a common symbolic interface. This design choice serves two purposes: (i) it enables direct evaluation of off-the-shelf MLLMs without task-specific fine-tuning, and (ii) it produces interpretable, language-grounded reasoning traces as a natural byproduct of decision-making.

Concretely, as shown in Fig. 3, A encompasses four high-level functional categories: (i) Navigation (e.g., Move), (ii) Viewpoint & Posture (e.g., Rotate), (iii) Interaction (e.g., Pick/Place), and (iv) Task-Control & Coordination (e.g., EndTask). The Action Interface translates these unified primitives into simulator-specific execution calls, ensuring that a single agent policy generalizes across diverse environments without modification. Detailed definitions of all available actions and parameters are deferred to Appendix F. The Action Interface (component iv) maps these unified primitives to simulator-specific execution calls, ensuring that a single agent policy generalizes across environments without modification (see Fig. 3 for a complete overview).

Environment Suite. We integrate eight backends under a unified agent-side abstraction to ensure cross-environment comparisons evaluate genuine real-world interactive spatial understanding rather than interface bias. The suite is organized into three families: Indoor Simulation (AI2-THOR [32], ProcTHOR [13], VirtualHome [50]) provides explicit physical affordances to test fine-grained object grounding, temporally ordered routines, and multi-agent coordination. Outdoor Navigation (CARLA [14], EmbodiedCity) extends to macroscopic scales, evaluating long-range route planning and progress estimation across dynamic urban and aerial topologies. Finally, while realistic simulators are indispensable, their difficulty is often entangled with photorealistic semantics and natural scene priors. To address this, we specifically implemented Custom Digital Games (e.g., Block3D, Snake3D,

By stripping away visual shortcuts, these lightweight environments isolate the abstract spatial logic and topological reasoning that fundamentally underpin real-world interactive spatial understanding. Detailed descriptions are provided in Appendix D.

Execution-Based Evaluation. Following OSWorld [75] and Spider2-V [8], SPATIALWORLD adopts terminal-state verification rather than static trajectory matching. A custom verifier Vi queries the final state to assess performance via two complementary metrics. The primary metric is TSR, which

measures the fraction of tasks where the terminal goal is fully satisfied: TSR = N1 Ni=1 1[Vi(s(Ti)) = 1], where s(Ti) is the terminal state for task i (task-specific adaptations, e.g., for Snake3D, are detailed in Appendix A.2). To evaluate efficiency beyond success, we measure Step Efficiency (SE): SE = |S|1 i∈S n

∗ i

ni , where S is the set of successful tasks, ni is the agent’s step count, and n∗i is the human-annotated reference length. Jointly reporting TSR and SE distinguishes efficient agents from exhaustive trial-and-error.

###### 2.4 Benchmark Construction

To systematically standardize the evaluation of spatial intelligence, SPATIALWORLD establishes a comprehensive benchmark construction protocol for its 760 tasks. Specifically, we first define a rigorous task taxonomy structured along two core dimensions: Scenario Categories and Complexity Levels, ensuring a diverse and hierarchical coverage of spatial capabilities. Guided by this taxonomy, we then employ a unified Data Construction pipeline to guarantee the high quality, consistency, and reproducibility of the entire dataset.

Scenario Categories. SPATIALWORLD separates everyday embodied operation from abstract spatial reasoning while keeping both under the same closed-loop evaluation protocol. The physical portion covers household routines, study and work activities, entertainment scenarios, travel-oriented navigation, and social collaboration, so that the benchmark spans object-centric manipulation, room-scale exploration, large-scale movement, and multi-agent coordination rather than a single simulatorspecific skill. The digital portion introduces 3D games as a complementary family: these tasks remove photorealistic semantics and instead emphasize geometric counting, maze planning, state tracking, and spatial transformation. Table 2 summarizes how these scenario categories are distributed across the eight environments.

Complexity Levels. Each task carries one of three complexity labels that reflect the cognitive demands placed on the agent. Navigation tasks require the agent to explore the 3D environment and reach a target location or object, without manipulating environment state. Interaction tasks require object-level state changes—picking, placing, opening, or toggling objects—but do not demand extensive spatial exploration. Hybrid tasks combine long-horizon navigation with multi-step manipulation, demanding both spatial exploration and fine-grained physical interaction.

Data Construction. As illustrated in Fig. 2, we adopt a unified data construction pipeline across all environments in SPATIALWORLD. For each task, the construction process consists of three stages: (i) task design, where annotators define the natural-language instruction and configure the initial environment state; (ii) human execution, where trained annotators independently solve each task in the simulator, recording the ground-truth terminal state and reference action sequence; and (iii) verification, where separate expert reviewers cross-check the task feasibility, instruction clarity, and evaluation script correctness. All verifier logic and success conditions are validated through rigorous inter-annotator cross-checking, further ensuring the consistency, accuracy, reproducibility, and unambiguity of the evaluation signal. Representative examples of the annotated evaluation scripts and human-validated cases are provided in Appendix E.

### 3 Experiment

###### 3.1 Experimental Setup

Models and Tasks. We benchmark 15 state-of-the-art MLLMs spanning open-source and proprietary families: Qwen series [3, 78, 64]; GLM series [26, 61]; Kimi series [62, 63]; Gemini series [60, 57, 58]; GPT series [55, 49]; Seed Series [5]. All models are evaluated using their official APIs or open-weight checkpoints without task-specific fine-tuning. Each model is prompted with the egocentric RGB screenshot and a natural-language task description at every step; no privileged state information is provided. All models are evaluated on the full SPATIALWORLD benchmark comprising 760 tasks across 8 simulation environments.

Evaluation Details. We use temperature τ = 1.0 and retain the latest w = 30 turns of interaction as context for all main experiments. The step budget for each task is dynamically determined as 2g +10, where g denotes the golden action count annotated by human annotators. Unless otherwise specified, we report TSR and SE aggregated over evaluated trajectories.

A significant gap remains between MLLM agents and real-world 3D environments. Current models struggle significantly with physical tasks, where the best-performing GPT-5 reaches only 14.4% Physical Overall TSR, followed by Qwen-3.5-397B-A17B at 12.2%. Furthermore, these successes are predominantly restricted to short-horizon, fundamental operations (e.g., turning on a device). Despite moderately better performance in digital domains, the universally low success rates underscore a persistent shortfall in human-level spatial intelligence.

SE reveals reliance on trial-and-error among similarly capable models. SE is informative for differentiating models with comparable TSR; large TSR gaps render it incomparable due to divergent completed task counts and difficulty distributions. For instance, Kimi-K2.5 and GPT-5.4 exhibit comparable Physical Overall TSRs (9.2% vs. 6.6%), yet GPT-5.4 achieves a higher SE (0.745 vs. 0.584). This contrast indicates that Kimi-K2.5 relies heavily on extensive trial-and-error, executing considerably more redundant or invalid actions to reach the same objectives.

Real-world spatial complexity demands comprehensive evaluation. Since no single model universally dominates—exemplified by GPT-5 and Qwen-3.5-397B-A17B tying in Work&Study tasks

(16.9%), GPT-5 leading Travel (6.8%), and Gemini-3.1-Pro leading Digital domains (39.0%)—our multifaceted benchmark is essential to accurately capture the diverse spatial capabilities required in real-world scenarios.

###### 3.3 Analysis

Beyond aggregate metrics, we dissect the benchmark along complementary axes—indoor–outdoor split, task complexity, multi-agent coordination, and game-family breakdown—to expose capabilityspecific bottlenecks, and probe perceptual factors (resolution, field of view) and inference-time hyperparameters (temperature, history window, action parameterization).

Indoor vs. Outdoor Physical Environments. We partition the single-agent physical benchmark into indoor and outdoor domains, excluding games and multi-agent setups to isolate scene comprehension. Fig. 5 and Table 6 (Appendix A.3) reveal a pronounced domain shift: GPT-5 (14.1%) and Qwen-3.5397B-A17B (13.7%) lead indoors, while Gemini-3-Flash (9.0%) and GPT-5 (8.3%) lead outdoors. This divergence exposes distinct algorithmic biases. GPT-5’s indoor superiority suggests robust fine-grained object grounding and low-level control, whereas the Gemini series’ outdoor success highlights strengths in long-horizon spatial reasoning and macro-level navigation.

Complexity Modes. Categorizing tasks by the action signatures from Section 2.4 reveals distinct complexity modes derived from golden action primitives: Navigation (movement and viewpoint), Interaction (object-state), and Navigation–Interaction (both). Fig. 6 illustrates a compound bottleneck: executing precise manipulations alongside long-term spatial progress (Navigation–Interaction, 4.2% mean TSR) is demonstrably harder than Interaction (50.2%). The variation in leading models across modes—with Gemini-series leading Navigation (8.6%) and GPT-5 dominating Interaction (69.4%) and the combined mode (12.1%)—validates the taxonomy. These modes successfully evaluate orthogonal capabilities rather than a singular difficulty scale.

Multi-Agent Social Environments. The Social Collaboration column in Table 3 pools MultiAI2THOR and Multi-ProcTHOR, but these environments stress different coordination patterns. Fig. 8a reports them separately. GPT-5 achieves the best pooled social TSR at 34.8%, followed by Qwen-3.5-397B-A17B at 19.6% and Kimi-K2.5 at 17.4%. Most of this signal comes from MultiAI2THOR, where object-centric cooperative routines are more frequently solved; Multi-ProcTHOR remains substantially harder, with the best models reaching only 5.9%. This suggests that current agents can coordinate in familiar, hand-authored indoor layouts, but procedural multi-agent layouts sharply reduce the reliability of shared progress tracking and role assignment.

Game-Level Breakdown. We further analyze performance across five digital game families (see Table 7 in Appendix A.4). The results reveal that while top models achieve strong reactive control in navigation and Snake tasks, they systematically struggle with games requiring explicit geometric reasoning and multi-step state transformations (e.g., Rubik and Block3D), indicating that spatial manipulation remains a fundamental bottleneck for multimodal agents.

Perceptual Factors. Figs. 8b and 8c show that perceptual configuration affects the visual evidence available to the agent. The resolution curve remains comparatively flat and locally non-monotonic, suggesting that image resolution does not materially affect interactive spatial understanding (see Appendix C for the visualization). For field of view, higher-FOV settings outperform narrow views overall, but gains plateau and vary by setting. We nevertheless keep the default field of view at 60 to more closely approximate a human-like first-person viewing condition.

Inference-time Hyperparameters. We also ablate temperature, history window size, and action parameterization on a subset in Fig. 7: temperature sensitivity is marginal, and optimal choices for

### 4 Related Work

###### 4.1 Multimodal Agents

Multimodal agents are characterized by unified perception and state representations over multimodal inputs (e.g., text, images, and videos), together with multi-step planning and decision-making to complete complex tasks via tool use or direct actions [74, 84, 38, 3, 59]. Early research followed two main directions: one focused on improving multimodal foundation models for stronger representation and understanding, establishing generalizable perceptual features and vision-language alignment [62, 43, 23]. The other developed agentic interaction and long-horizon task execution frameworks, enabling iterative planning and sequential decision-making in interactive environments [25, 24, 68]. The multimodal agents have been applied across a wide range of settings, including image understanding and editing [87, 86, 20], computer use via screen-based interaction [65, 67, 70], and physical embodied environments [15, 39, 18, 10].

###### 4.2 3D Environment Simulators

A wide range of 3D simulation platforms have been developed to support spatial reasoning, navigation, and autonomous decision-making across diverse domains [34, 72, 51, 73, 83]. For indoor embodied interaction, AI2-THOR [32] provides interactive, near-photorealistic scenes with rich object affordances for studying task-oriented manipulation. Habitat [53] offers an efficient modular framework with configurable sensors and agent embodiments, and is widely used for navigation, instruction following, and embodied question answering. For autonomous driving, CARLA [14] and MetaDrive [37] simulate urban traffic with flexible sensor suites and dynamic actors, serving as standard testbeds for learning-based perception and control. Recent efforts further expand simulator coverage and realism [19, 4, 82, 33], broadening the space of scenarios and world dynamics available for evaluation. Despite these advances, existing platforms and their associated scenarios remain domain-specific (e.g., indoor manipulation vs. urban driving) and adopt heterogeneous task definitions and interfaces, making it difficult to compare general, open-ended task-solving ability across settings.

###### 4.3 Spatial Reasoning of Multimodal Agents

Spatial reasoning in multimodal agents refers to the ability to ground goals in real-world perceptual observations and maintain an evolving spatial belief about the environment under observability [89, 6, 77, 9], enabling agents to localize objects, infer relative motion relationships, and support reliable planning and action in physical space [44, 88, 45]. Spatial reasoning has been primarily evaluated

through visual question answering benchmarks [30, 28, 42, 2, 47, 16, 71, 17] under fixed 2D observations, with recent evaluations extending to 3D and video settings [81, 41, 27, 79] to test whether models can build and recall spatial structure from sequential observations. Multi-turn interaction is essential for spatial reasoning, as agents must make sequential decisions to gather information and update spatial beliefs over time. However, most existing multi-step benchmarks are either grounded in 2D screen [75, 52, 31] or adopt heterogeneous embodied interfaces and observation assumptions [44, 36, 22]. For instance, EmbodiedBench [80] evaluates agents that process visual and sensor data to predict low-level atomic navigation or manipulation actions. In contrast, SPATIALWORLD evaluates foundation multimodal agents under a unified closed-loop protocol across heterogeneous 3D environments. Agents receive only egocentric RGB observations and high-level task instructions, and their success is determined by task-specific terminal-state verifiers rather than static answer matching or low-level action prediction accuracy.

### 5 Conclusion

We introduced SPATIALWORLD, a unified benchmark designed to evaluate the interactive spatial reasoning of MLLMs. By abstracting simulator-specific complexities into a shared text-based interface, our benchmark rigorously assesses an agent’s capacity for active egocentric exploration and decision-making under partial observability. Extensive evaluations of 15 leading MLLMs reveal a critical vulnerability: while current models excel at static scene perception, they struggle profoundly with dynamic physical environments—exhibiting low task success rates, severe execution inefficiencies, and high domain variance. These bottlenecks underscore a fundamental gap in robust interactive spatial reasoning and long-horizon planning. We envision SPATIALWORLD as a foundational testbed to shift the paradigm of MLLM research from passive observation to the realization of general-purpose spatial agents capable of seamless interaction in the real world.

### A Additional Benchmark Details

This section provides supplementary details for the benchmark construction and evaluation described in Sections 3.1 and the main benchmark protocol. We include a full benchmark comparison table, task-specific evaluation criteria, and fine-grained performance breakdowns across indoor/outdoor environments and digital game families.

###### A.1 Detailed Benchmark Comparison

- Table 5 presents an extended comparison of SPATIALWORLD against existing spatial reasoning benchmarks spanning three major categories: ImageQA, VideoQA, and embodied-agent evaluation. We compare along five critical dimensions: (1) whether the benchmark provides a unified crossplatform interface that abstracts away environment-specific APIs, (2) whether agents interact with a dynamic, interactive environment rather than answering questions over static inputs, (3) whether observations are captured from a first-person (egocentric) perspective, (4) whether the input modality is purely visual without auxiliary structured data such as depth maps or object coordinates, and (5) whether the output is expressed in natural language form. As shown in the table, existing ImageQA and VideoQA benchmarks [66, 46, 71, 76, 79] predominantly evaluate passive spatial understanding through static question answering, lacking interactive environments and unified interfaces. Embodied benchmarks [54, 85, 11, 80] introduce interactivity but typically sacrifice one or more desirable properties—either requiring privileged non-visual inputs, lacking language-form outputs, or being restricted to a single simulation platform. In contrast, SPATIALWORLD is the only benchmark that simultaneously satisfies all five criteria, enabling a holistic evaluation of active spatial reasoning under realistic embodied constraints across diverse environments.

###### A.2 Task-Specific Evaluation Details

While SPATIALWORLD primarily evaluates tasks using the binary TSR based on exact goal satisfaction, certain environments require task-specific adaptations.

For instance, in the Snake3D environment, exact completion is too sparse to separate weak partial progress from complete failure. Therefore, instead of using a binary success indicator, we evaluate performance by reporting a scale-normalized discrete score. This is calculated by dividing the achieved snake score by the spatial edge length of the game environment, providing a more granular measure of the agent’s progress.

###### A.3 Indoor vs. Outdoor Performance Breakdown

- Table 6 reports the per-environment TSR for all 15 evaluated models, partitioned into indoor (AI2THOR, ProcTHOR, VirtualHome) and outdoor (CARLA, EmbodiedCity) domains. Multiagent environments are excluded here and analyzed separately in Fig. 8a. The overall columns pool the environments within each domain. This fine-grained breakdown reveals that GPT-5 and Qwen-3.5-397B-A17B dominate in indoor scenarios requiring precise object grounding, whereas GPT-5 and Gemini-3-Flash lead in outdoor scenarios that demand long-range navigation and spatial planning.

- Table 6: Indoor-outdoor. The TSR (%) of the single-agent physical benchmark across indoor and outdoor environments. Bold and underlined entries denote the best and second-best values in each column, respectively. Multi-agent environments are excluded here and analyzed separately in Figure 8a. The overall columns pool the environments within each domain and are located at the right edge of each domain group.

A.4 Game-Level Performance Breakdown

- Table 7 presents the per-game-family TSR for all evaluated models across five digital game environments: Block3D (B3D), Maze, Maze3D (M3D), Rubik’s Cube, and Snake. Each column pools the available levels for the corresponding game. The Snake environment normalizes scores by the spatial edge length and caps each level contribution at 100%.

Gemini-3.1-Pro demonstrates the highest overall efficacy (39.0%), driven by strong results on Block3D (40.0%) and Snake (90.0%), while Gemini-3-Flash leads Rubik’s Cube (50.0%). In contrast, topological traversal tasks expose different architectural strengths: Qwen3-VL-235B-Thinking excels in both 2D pathfinding (Maze, 70.0%) and 3D perspective navigation (Maze3D, 32.0%), whereas GPT-5 is strongest on Snake (91.2%). This performance divergence reveals that while top-tier architectures demonstrate robust proficiency in reactive visual-motor alignment and topological routing, they systematically falter on tasks demanding explicit geometric reasoning and complex structural state transformations. The generally low success rates on Rubik and Block3D emphasize that multi-step spatial manipulation remains a fundamental bottleneck for embodied intelligence.

### B Ablation Studies

This section provides detailed ablation results complementing the analysis in Section 3.1. As summarized in Fig. 7 of the main text, we study three inference-time factors—temperature, history window size, and action parameterization—and find that their optimal settings are model-dependent rather than universal. Below we discuss each factor in detail.

###### B.1 Temperature

Fig. 7 illustrates the impact of sampling temperature on performance. We observe that nearly all models, with the sole exception of Gemini-3-Flash, achieve their optimal performance at τ = 1.0. Consequently, following the evaluation protocol of OSWorld [75], we set τ = 1.0 for all models. This configuration ensures protocol uniformity across model families while preserving moderate sampling diversity throughout long-horizon interactions.

###### B.2 History Window Size

Fig. 7 illustrates that w = 30 serves as an optimal sliding window size across most evaluated models. We observe that while performance improves with initial increases in window size, it tends to plateau or slightly diminish beyond w = 30. This suggests that a context window of 30 frames provides sufficient temporal information, and further extending the visual history does not yield universal gains. Consequently, we adopt w = 30 as the default context window for the main benchmark. In our ablation analysis, the corresponding main-run result is treated as the w = 30 baseline to ensure consistency.

###### B.3 Continuous versus Discrete Motion

Fig. 7 reveals no universal preference for continuous over discrete motion. In the actionparameterization panel, each bar reports ∆TSR = TSRcontinuous − TSRdiscrete in percentage points; positive values favor continuous action parameters, whereas negative values favor the discrete interface. Because the optimal action parameterization is model-dependent, we utilize discrete actions in the main benchmark. This decision maintains interface consistency across environments and avoids biasing the leaderboard toward a control granularity that favors a specific model family.

### C Observation Sensitivity Analysis

- Fig. 9 shows visualizations at various resolutions. Decreasing resolution does not impair the model’s spatial reasoning because spatial perception relies on physical, projective, and ray relationships, which are unaffected by lower resolutions. The visual results confirm that the model maintains accurate spatial awareness.

### D Environment Suite

SPATIALWORLD uses its environment suite as the main source of domain diversity rather than as a passive collection of scenes. We wrap eight 3D backends with a shared agent-side API, so agents interact through the same observation and action abstractions while the environments retain their native differences in scale, dynamics, object affordances, and scene generation. This design exposes a broad spectrum of spatial demands under one evaluation surface: hand-authored indoor worlds test fine-grained object grounding, procedural houses test layout generalization, urban and aerial environments test long-range progress estimation, multi-agent variants test coordination, and digital games isolate abstract geometric reasoning. As a result, cross-environment comparisons reflect genuine differences in 3D task-solving requirements rather than changes in the agent interface. The suite is organized into three families.

Indoor Simulation. AI2-THOR [32] provides hand-designed, near-photorealistic indoor scenes with explicit object affordances, physical interactions, and state changes; it therefore anchors the benchmark in fine-grained object grounding and manipulation. ProcTHOR [13] extends this setting through procedurally generated houses, increasing layout diversity and reducing reliance on a fixed set of manually authored rooms. VirtualHome [50] complements both environments by representing household activities as executable programs, making it suitable for scripted daily routines that require temporally ordered actions. Building on the same indoor affordance space, the multi-agent variants of AI2-THOR and ProcTHOR introduce cooperative tasks in which success depends not only on locating or manipulating objects, but also on coordinating role-specific progress across agents.

Outdoor Navigation. CARLA [14] shifts the benchmark from indoor object interaction to urban driving, where agents must reason over road topology, long-range route progress, and dynamic traffic context. EmbodiedCity further broadens the outdoor setting to aerial city navigation, emphasizing landmark-based localization, altitude-aware movement, and macroscopic spatial planning over dense urban layouts. Together, the outdoor environments test whether a model can maintain progress estimates and termination decisions when the relevant spatial evidence is distributed across a much larger field than a household room.

Digital Game Environments. Indoor and outdoor simulators are indispensable for realistic embodied tasks, but they do not exhaust the space of 3D reasoning problems: their difficulty is often entangled with photorealistic semantics, simulator affordances, and natural scene priors. We therefore add lightweight 3D games as controlled probes that isolate abstract spatial abilities under closed-loop interaction. Block3D requires three-view geometric counting from orthographic projections; Maze and Maze3D test topological planning in two- and three-dimensional layouts; Snake3D stresses incremental state tracking under self-occlusion and limited free space; and Rubik’s Cube evaluates spatial transformation and configuration reasoning. These games broaden the benchmark beyond

household and urban navigation by exposing spatial structures that are rare in realistic simulators but central to general 3D reasoning.

### E Human Annotation

To ensure the quality and reproducibility of SPATIALWORLD, all 760 tasks undergo a rigorous three-stage human annotation process (see Fig. 2 for an overview of the pipeline). In the first stage, annotators design each task by specifying the natural-language instruction and configuring the initial environment state. In the second stage, annotators independently solve each task inside the simulator, recording the ground-truth terminal state and a reference action trajectory. In the third stage, annotators cross-check each other’s work to verify task feasibility, instruction clarity, and evaluation-script correctness. Table 8 presents representative examples of the resulting annotated evaluation scripts, which retrieve dynamic state data (e.g., spatial coordinates, object containment, vehicle kinematics) from the 3D simulators to reliably assess functional correctness in open-ended physical environments.

### F Action Space Definition

This section details the SPATIALWORLD unified action interface. As introduced in Section 2.3, this interface abstracts raw backend commands into high-level text primitives to form a unified MLLM-native action space. Table 9 categorizes these primitives into four canonical groups. In this specification, 0 denotes an explicit no-motion/wait decision, used when the agent should hold its position without changing pose (e.g., waiting at a red light or pausing for coordination).

This specification maps diverse environment behaviors to a standard set of expected primitives. For instance, Move seamlessly handles everything from a 0.25m indoor step to a 10m driving advance, or simply waiting in place (0). Similarly, object interactions are distinctly separated at the interface level: ChangeState targets verifiable persistent state transitions (e.g., opening, cooking), while Manipulate handles local force-based or relational interventions (e.g., pushing, grabbing).

### G GPT-5 vs. GPT-5.4 Case Study

To explain why GPT-5 outperforms GPT-5.4 in the current benchmark, we compare the two models on the 609 shared single-agent physical tasks spanning AI2THOR, ProcTHOR, VirtualHome, CARLA,

- Figure 10: Why GPT-5 currently outperforms GPT-5.4. GPT-5 achieves higher shared-task TSR in most physical environments, while GPT-5.4 exhibits a stronger tendency toward premature termination. The step-count plots further show that GPT-5 typically spends more actions both when it succeeds and when it fails, consistent with a slower but more persistent search strategy.

and EmbodiedCity. GPT-5 succeeds on 78 of these tasks (12.8%), whereas GPT-5.4 succeeds on 40 (6.6%). The largest shared-task gaps appear in VirtualHome (+28.9 points), AI2THOR (+7.7), and CARLA (+6.2), while EmbodiedCity slightly favors GPT-5.4 (-3.8) and ProcTHOR remains unsolved by both. The disagreement is also asymmetric: GPT-5 solves 52 tasks that GPT-5.4 misses, whereas GPT-5.4 recovers only 14 in the reverse direction. Most of GPT-5’s advantage comes from Daily Household, Work & Study, and Travel tasks, rather than from a uniform lead across every category.

The error profile suggests that the main difference is termination policy rather than raw action speed.

- Fig. 10 shows that GPT-5.4 fails primarily by stopping too early: across the environments with comparable failure logs, 32.4% of its failures are premature DONE decisions and 48.5% are explicit FAIL decisions. GPT-5 instead fails more often by persistence without completion, with 63.6% of failures ending at the step limit and another 15.1% ending after repeated action failures. This behavioral gap is mirrored in action counts. On successful tasks, GPT-5 uses a median of 7 steps, compared with 3.5 for GPT-5.4; on failed tasks, the medians are 22 and 11, respectively. GPT-5 is therefore slower and less efficient, but it is also more willing to keep exploring until the verifier conditions are actually met, whereas GPT-5.4 often commits to an early terminal decision before the state is sufficiently verified.

### H Qualitative Analysis

To complement the quantitative evaluation in Section 3.1, we provide a qualitative analysis of agent failure modes and their relationship to spatial reasoning capabilities.

Failure Mode Breakdown. We manually inspect 100 failed trajectories and categorize failures into:

- (i) Spatial Disorientation—the agent loses track of its position and cannot return to a target location;
- (ii) Object Hallucination—the agent issues Interact actions on objects not present in the current view; (iii) Premature Termination—the agent issues EndTask(status=DONE or FAIL) before the

goal is satisfied; and (iv) Action Loop—the agent cycles through the same sequence of ineffective actions until the step budget is exhausted. We select four representative bad cases for detailed qualitative analysis in the following section, covering spatial disorientation, object hallucination, premature termination, and action-loop behaviors.

Bad cases analysis. In Fig. 11 - 14, we present several bad cases for various state-of-the-art models across four distinct environments. These examples cover the full spectrum of failure modes. We present the performance of two mainstream closed-source models, GPT-5 and Gemini-3.1-Pro, in terms of two failure modes, Spatial Disorientation and Premature Termination, under different environments in Fig. 11 and 13. In Fig. 11, GPT-5 exhibits spatial disorientation at Step 6, failing to accurately perceive the surrounding obstacles. This deficiency makes it difficult for the agent to reach the LightSwitch while moving forward, thereby hindering interaction and ultimately triggering a premature termination before the task is completed. Similarly, in Fig. 13, Gemini-3.1-Pro suffers from spatial disorientation during a simple localization and navigation task. Unable to determine the correct path to the street lamp, the model performs multiple ineffective turns and prematurely invokes the Done action before actually reaching the target storefront. These two cases demonstrate that simple spatial localization and object interaction tasks, while trivial for humans, still pose significant challenges for current MLLMs.

Fig. 12 illustrates Object Hallucination and Action Loop as two additional types of failure modes. At Step 7, Gemini-3.1-Pro mistakenly assumes it has already grasped the phone, proceeding directly to execute the second task of picking up the mouse. This fundamentally stems from the model’s lack of complex spatial understanding capabilities in real-world scenarios. Consequently, despite colliding with the wall after Step 9, the model continues attempting to move forward, resulting in an action loop. Even the formidable open-source model, Qwen-3.5-397B-A17B, exhibits corresponding issues when executing a simple daily routine task, as shown in Fig. 14.

- Table 10: Representative GPT-5 vs. GPT-5.4 disagreement cases. These examples illustrate the recurring pattern that GPT-5.4 often terminates after a short or partial trajectory, while GPT-5 spends more actions and eventually satisfies the verifier.

Human Validation. Human annotators solve tasks during benchmark construction to verify feasibility and provide reference action counts. We use these trajectories as validation artifacts for task correctness rather than as a separate leaderboard.

### I Limitations and Broader Impact

Limitations. Like most embodied AI benchmarks, SPATIALWORLD operates in simulated environments rather than on physical robotic platforms. While the selected simulators provide nearphotorealistic rendering and physically plausible dynamics, extending evaluation to real-world settings remains a promising direction for future work. Furthermore, to ensure annotation quality, the current 760 tasks are carefully handcrafted, making the scale more modest compared to automatically generated datasets. These tasks cover six scenario categories and eight backends, and the rich diversity of real-world spatial reasoning scenarios offers ample room for future expansion.

Broader Impact. SPATIALWORLD serves primarily as a diagnostic and scientific tool for understanding the spatial reasoning capabilities of multimodal agents. By systematically characterizing agent failure modes, this work contributes to the development of more reliable and trustworthy spatial agent systems, while the emphasis on open and reproducible evaluation fosters transparency in the research community. On the other hand, improvements in spatial reasoning could potentially be misused to enhance autonomous surveillance or enable unintended physical-world manipulation by embodied agents; we encourage the community to develop appropriate safety guidelines as these capabilities advance.

### J Compute Resources

For proprietary models (GPT-5, Gemini-3.1-Pro-Preview, Claude-Sonnet-4.6, etc.), we access them exclusively through their official APIs. For open-source models (Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct, InternVL378B, etc.), we deploy them on a GUP-server equipped with 8× NVIDIA H200 GPUs. The full evaluation campaign across all models equipped on GPU server consumed approximately 5,000 GPU hours in total.

### K LLM Usage

We used an OpenAI LLM (GPT-5) as a writing and formatting assistant. In particular, it helped refine grammar and phrasing, improve clarity, and suggest edits to figure/table captions and layout (e.g., column alignment, caption length, placement). The LLM did not contribute to research ideation, experimental design, implementation, data analysis, or technical content beyond surface-level edits. All outputs were reviewed and edited by the authors, who take full responsibility for the final text and

Thinking: The pan has been cleaned. I can see a bowl-like silver object on the counter near the other items, so the next required object is likely the bowl. I should clean the bowl before searching for the light switch. Action: CleanObject(Bowl)

Thinking: The bowl may still be farther back on the counter, and the previous cleaning action might not have reached the correct object or range. To make sure I can interact with it, I should move closer to the counter and bowl. Action: MoveAhead(Medium)

Thinking: My view is still focused on the kitchen counter, and the bowl is visible among the objects near the vegetables. Since the task still requires the bowl to be clean, I should attempt to clean the bowl again from this position. Action: CleanObject(Bowl)

Thinking: The pan has been cleaned, and the bowl has now been handled. The remaining task is to turn off the light. I do not see a switch from the counter view, so I need to rotate and inspect the walls or doorway area. Action: RotateRight

- Step 2
- Step 3

Thinking: I am in the kitchen facing a counter with several objects. A dirty pan is clearly visible in front of me, and the task requires cleaning the pan and bowl before turning off the light. I should clean the pan first because it is close and easy to reach. Action: CleanObject(Pan)

Thinking: I am now facing a door and wall area, which is a likely place for a light switch. There appears to be a vertical object near the door that could be the switch. I should try toggling the light switch off. Action: ToggleObjectOff(LightSwitch)

Thinking: I can see the desk and mouse, but the mobile phone is not on the desk or in my current view. Since I need the phone before placing it on the table, I should turn left and check the adjacent room. Action: TurnLeft(normal)

Thinking: I now see the mobile phone on a coffee table in front of me. It is visible but still too far away to grab. I need to walk forward toward the coffee table so I can reach the phone. Action: WalkForward(Medium)

Thinking: The view still did not change after turning right, which suggests I may be stuck or the action failed. I should try turning left instead, hoping it changes my orientation and helps me escape the stuck state. Action: TurnLeft(degrees=large)
