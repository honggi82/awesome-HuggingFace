Large Language Models (LLMs) can achieve enhanced complex problem-solving through test-time computing scaling, yet this often entails longer contexts and numerous reasoning token costs. In this paper, we propose an efficient test-time scaling method that trains LLMs on code-related reasoning trajectories, facilitating their reduction of excess thinking tokens while maintaining performance. First, we create Z1-Code-Reasoning-107K, a curated dataset of simple and complex coding problems paired with their short and long solution trajectories. Second, we present a novel Shifted Thinking Window to mitigate overthinking overhead by removing context-delimiting tags (e.g., <think>...</think>) and capping reasoning tokens. Trained with long and short trajectory data and equipped with Shifted Thinking Window, our model, Z1-7B, demonstrates the ability to adjust its reasoning level as the complexity of problems and exhibits efficient test-time scaling across different reasoning tasks that matches R1-Distill-Qwen-7B performance with about 30% of its average thinking tokens. Notably, fine-tuned with only code trajectories, Z1-7B demonstrates generalization to broader reasoning tasks (47.5% on GPQA Diamond). Our analysis of efficient reasoning elicitation also provides valuable insights for future research.1

#### 1 Introduction

Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), such as OpenAI o1 [1] and DeepSeek R1 [2], have demonstrated remarkable advances in complex reasoning tasks through test-time compute scaling [3], particularly in competitive mathematics and programming. These models, trained with large-scale Reinforcement Learning (RL) [4, 5], have emerged step-by-step reasoning abilities to solve complex problems effectively. However, the elaborate reasoning process also leads to super long contexts and numerous thinking tokens, challenging the efficient utilization of LRMs.

Existing open-source works, such as s1 [6] and LIMO [7], train non-reasoning models into reasoning models with manually curated problems and distilled long chain-of-thought (CoT) [3] trajectories yet do not address the challenges posed by test-time compute scaling with respect to long contexts and an excessive thinking tokens. For example, s1 [6] introduces budget forcing, which either appends ending words to truncate reasoning processes or extrapolation words (e.g., "wait") to inspire the model to continue thinking, thereby precisely controlling context length. While extrapolation words can control model reasoning, direct truncations may disrupt the model’s thinking process, consequently degrading performance. Thus, we propose the problem: "Is there an efficient test-time scaling way to reduce the model’s thinking tokens consumption while preserving its reasoning performance?".

In this paper, we implement efficient test-time scaling with code-related trajectory fine-tuning and present the shifted thinking mode of LRMs: weak reasoning to simple problems, strong reasoning to complex problems, which significantly reduces the thinking tokens consumption of LRMs in problem solving. Specifically, we create the Z1-Code-Reasoning-107K dataset, comprising 107K simple and complex code-related problems paired with their reasoning traces distilled from the QwQ-32B-Preview [8] model. We train Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct [9] into a reasoning model, with this 107K code-related long and short trajectory dataset. We eliminate the context split with delimiters (e.g., <think>...</think>) and introduce novel Shifted Thinking Window: (I) For simple problems, the models generate solutions with in a low reasoning token computation. (II) For complex problems, we cap the thinking tokens; if the model outputs exceeds this threshold, we append a hint phrase to the end of reasoning trace, forcing it to produce an answer based on the existing thought process. Shifted Thinking Window enables model that get trained with long and short trajectories to adjust their reasoning level as the complexity of problems, thereby avoiding the overthinking of LRMs. Fine-tuned on long and short reasoning trajectories and equipped with the Shifted Thinking Window, our model Z1-7B exhibits efficient test-time scaling across different reasoning tasks and matches R1-Distill-Qwen-7B performance with about 30% (as shown in Figure 1) its average thinking tokens.

Furthermore, we conduct data ablation experiments to identify the critical factors driving reasoning elicitation. We design three greedy dataset sampling strategies and train Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct with these subsets, highlighting two crucial factors (Mean Trajectory Length and Training Sample Size) in trajectory dataset: (1) longest-greedy sampling, which prioritizes the longest token-length samples to ensure the inclusion of the most extended reasoning traces; (2) shortest greedy sampling, which selects the shortest token-length samples; and (3) random sampling under different sample sizes (16K, 64K). Our results reveal that the model trained on the longest-greedy subset exhibits the best performance, underscoring the importance of trajectory length in training dataset for efficient test-time scaling. We also investigate model performance across varying training sample sizes, by comparing the subsets (16K, 64K, full) of different sizes. Experimental results demonstrate that the full Z1-Code-Reasoning-107K dataset outperforms all smaller subsets, highlighting the significance of dataset size for reasoning model fine-tuning.

In summary, our contributions are threefold: (1) We implement efficient test-time scaling with code and successfully generalize it to reasoning tasks beyond code. (2) We propose the shifted thinking window, a method that prevents overthinking by adapting to the complexity of reasoning tasks, significantly improving thinking efficiency of reasoning models. (3) Through data ablation studies, we dissect reasoning datasets with code and identify key factors for effective reasoning elicitation.

#### 2 Z1: Efficient Test-time Scaling with Code

As illustrated in Figure 2, to achieve efficient test-time scaling, we train non-reasoning models of code-related reasoning trajectories with varying lengths and introduce shifted thinking window to replace the context split with delimiters (e.g., <think>...</think>). After supervised fine-tuning (SFT),

- 2.1) and of the shifted thinking window (Section 2.2).

- 2.1 Dataset Creation

We create an efficient test-time scaling dataset that integrates both short reasoning trajectories for simple problems and strong reasoning trajectories for complex problems, emphasizing diverse reasoning trajectory lengths in the training set. However, existing reasoning trajectory datasets predominantly feature complex problems with long chains of thought (CoT), posing a challenge for training efficient reasoning models due to the lack of short and straightforward trajectories. To address this, we approach the problem from the perspective of evolving question complexity and select problems from Code Evol-Instruct dataset [10], which evolves in depth and breadth to cover a wide range of complexities and has proven effective in non-reasoning models [11]. We generate reasoning trajectories using the QwQ-32B-preview model and truncated the trajectories length to 8192 tokens, removing approximately 3% of samples with repetitive reasoning processes to mitigate excessive cyclic thinking in the training data. The remaining reasoning trajectories, paired with

their problems, constitute the Z1-code-reasoning-107K dataset, with less than 1% of the data being truncated.

To further analyze our dataset, we compare the top-50 trigram word frequencies of Z1-CodeReasoning-107K with OpenThoughts-114K [12] dataset2. Z1-code-reasoning-107K exclusively contains code-related reasoning trajectories, while OpenThoughts-114K is a reasoning dataset distilled from DeepSeek R1, featuring 114K high-quality examples spanning math, science, code, and puzzles. Figure 3 illustrates a trend in the word frequency distributions of Z1-code-reasoning-107K and OpenThoughts-114K: high-frequency trigrams exhibit homogeneity, while mid-frequency trigrams show differentiation. For example, the high-frequency trigrams in both datasets (e.g., "I need to," "we need to," "the number of") indicate the model’s summarization of the next reasoning step, which highlights the commonality between code trajectory and other complex problems. In contrast, mid-frequency trigrams in Z1-code-reasoning-107K, such as "iterate through the" and "for each," capture loop-based logic characteristic of code-related trajectories, distinct from the mathematical logic exemplified by trigrams (e.g., "a+b", "equal to the") in OpenThoughts-114K. This underscores the unique reasoning patterns inherent in code-related trajectories.

- 2.2 Shifted Thinking Window

To enforce a "think-before-answer" pattern, existing LRMs like DeepSeek R1 typically use delimiters (e.g., <think>...</think>) to split the context window into two parts, where the model first reasons in the thinking window and then outputs the final answer in the answering window. However, this pattern often introduces unnecessary reasoning when processing simple problems that do not require deep thought. In the training and inference of our model, we eliminate this context split, allowing the model to flexibly fine-tune and generalize across short and long trajectories and avoiding the overthoughts for simple problems. We refer it to Shifted Thinking Window, where the model’s context window is not rigidly divided into two parts by delimiters but instead of a shifted window: (I) For simple problems, the model fine-tuned on both short and long trajectories can directly output concise reasoning and answers within the context. (II) For complex problems, we cap the maximum thinking length within which the model can either reason or provide an answer; if the reasoning trajectory exceeds this maximum length, the end of the model’s output will be appended with a hint phrase to enforce a direct answer. The essence of shifted thinking: weak reasoning for simple problems and strong reasoning for complex problems significantly reduces unnecessary reasoning by model, thereby demonstrating more efficient test-time compute scalings.

- 3 Experiments

- 3.1 Implementation Details

Following the previous work [6], we take a model that has already been pretrained and instruction tuned and further finetune it for reasoning. Specifically, we select Qwen2.5-Coder-Instruct series models, which have already achieves a good performance on various code-related benchmarks. For all training samples, we avoid using delimiters (e.g., <think>...</think>) to separate the whole trajectory into thinking part and the answering part. This adjustment allows the LRM to avoid mandated overthinking, enabling more automatic and efficient test-time scaling: weak reasoning for simple problems and strong reasoning for complex problems.

We perform supervised finetuning on Qwen-2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct [9] using our Z1-Code-Reasoning107K dataset, yielding Z1-7B. We do not compute loss on questions, only on reasoning trajectories and solutions. For fine-tuning hyperparameters, we train our model with a learning rate of 1e-5 warmed up linearly for 100 steps and then decayed over the rest of training (836 steps in total training) following a cosine schedule. We train all the models in bfloat16 precision with Pytorch Fully Shard Data Parallel (FSDP) and set a global batch size to 128 for 2 epochs using 8 NVIDIA

##### 3.2 Evaluation Setup

Benchmarks We select three representative reasoning benchmarks covering different topics: LiveCodeBench [13] continuously collects new problems over time from contests across three competition platforms, including LeetCode, AtCoder, and CodeForces. Unless otherwise specified, we benchmarks LLMs on such competition-level programming tasks with the latest full set (880 problems until Feb, 2025) of LiveCodeBench v5. GPQA Diamond [14] consists of 198 PhD-level science questions from Biology, Chemistry and Physics. Experts with PhDs in the corresponding domains only achieved 69.7% on GPQA Diamond, which show its inherent difficulty and challenges. MATH500 [15] is a benchmark of competition math problems of varying difficulty. Following previous work [2], we evaluate our model on the same subset selected by OpenAI [4]. Alongside the three common reasoning benchmarks, we also incorporate a non-reasoning benchmark: BigCodeBench is a benchmark mainly focusing on more challenging and practical code generation with complex instructions and diverse function calls. In this section, we adopt the BigCodeBench-Hard-Instruct (148 problems included) subset to evaluate LRM on short trajectory thinking. For all benchmarks, we generate a sample for each question with a temperature of 0 (greedy) to measure accuracy. Through these benchmarks, we can evaluate the reasoning ability of LLMs from difference perspectives.

Baselines We benchmark Z1 against a series of top-tier models: OpenAI o1-series models [1]: o1-mini and o1-preview, representing close-source test-time scaling models; Deepseek-R1 series [2]: Deepseek-R1, R1-Distill-Qwen (32B and 7B) and Qwen’s QwQ-32B-Preview [16], open-weight reasoning models; Sky-T1-32B-Preview [17], s1.1-7B [6], OpenThinker-7B [12], open models with open reasoning data; Deepseek-V3 [18], GPT-4o [19], Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct [9], four representative non-reasoning models. Our model, Z1, is fully open including weights, reasoning data, and code. We evaluate Z1 using shifted thinking window with a maximum thinking tokens of 4,096. For all baseline models, we use the reported results whenever available. If no reported scores are provided, we evaluate the model using budget forcing with the configuration provided.

##### 3.3 Main Result

- Table 1 presents the results of Z1 and other models on 4 benchmarks, highlighting the following salient observations:

- Table 2: Z1-Code-Reasoning-107K Data Ablations. We use a maximum of around 4,096 thinking tokens for all scores in this table. The Random Sampling method does not alter the average trajectory length of the training samples. Both length-greedy sampling methods (longest and shortest) utilize the same number of training tokens (74M).

(1) Z1 models achieve comparable performance level with GPT-4o on benchmarks of complex problems. (Avg. 45.4 vs 47.7) This result highlights the success of test-time scaling with code, where performance improvements are achieved by leveraging extended reasoning traces during inference, rather than solely relying on increased model size. (2) Trained with trajectory data with code, Z1-7B outperforms other 7B-scale language reasoning models. This outcome underscores the effectiveness of our test-time scaling approach, particularly when fine-tuned with code-realted reasoning data. (3) Fine-tuning the model exclusively with code-related reasoning data enables it to generalize across different domains. Z1 models, fine-tuned on large amount of trajectories data with code, displays superior generalization on GPQA Diamond (47.5%) and MATH500 (76.4%). This suggests the effectiveness of code-related trajectory training for language reasoning elicitation.

##### 3.4 Data Ablations

To further investigate the critical factors influencing effective reasoning elicitation in training data, we designed an ablation study with random sampling and greedy sampling strategies (as shown in Algorithm 1) and obtain representative subsets with two key factors (Mean Trajectory Length and Training Sample Size) that influences Z1’s reasoning elicitation: (1) Random Sampling: Samples are chosen randomly, serving as a baseline for comparison. We conduct random sampling with varying sample sizes (16K, 64K) to assess the impact of training samples on efficient test-time scaling. (2) Longest Greedy Sampling: At each step, we select only the samples with the highest token counts, ensuring the subset contains the longest training examples in terms of reasoning traces. (3) Shortest Greedy Sampling : At each step, we select only the samples with the lowest token counts, maximizing the number of samples included in the subset while adhering to the token budget.

For all subsets, we calculate the Mean Trajectory Length (MTL) as follows:

1 n

MTL =

n

Lengthi(tokens) (1)

i=1

Where n denotes the number of training samples and Lengthi represents the trajectory length (tokens) of the i-th training sample. For all benchmarks, we calculated the Average Thinking Time (ATT) as follows:

n

1 n

Lengthi(tokens) (2)

ATT =

i=1

Where n denotes the number of problems in benchmarks and Lengthi represents the trajectory length of the i-th problem. We fine-tune Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct on these representative subsets.

- Table 2 presents the evaluation results of models fine-tuned on different subsets of the training data, highlighting the following observations:

Impact of Mean Trajectory Length Under the same training budget of 74M tokens, we sample two subsets with different mean trajectory length using two strategies: longest-greedy and shortest-greedy sampling. As shown in Table 2, the subset sampled via longest-greedy strategy exhibits a significantly higher MTL (2,216) compared to the shortest-greedy subset (807). This difference in training trajectory length translates into notable performance distinctions during evaluation. Specifically, the model fine-tuned on the longest-greedy subset demonstrates a longer Average Thinking Time (AVG score: 1,617 vs. 1,257) and a higher Benchmark Score (AVG score: 50.8 vs. 49.1) compared to the model trained on the shortest-greedy subset. These results underscore the critical role of Trajectory Length in the training set, suggesting that longer trajectories enhance the model’s capacity for test-time scaling by encouraging more deliberate and extended reasoning during inference.

Impact of Training Sample Size To investigate the effect of training sample size, we randomly sample subsets of varying sizes (16K and 64K) from the original 107K dataset and compare the resulting models performance. As shown in Table 2, the model fine-tuned on the full 107K dataset achieves an Average Thinking Time of 1,507 and a Benchmark Score of 53.1, outperforming the model trained on the Random-64K subset (1,390 and 50.1, respectively). In contrast, the smallest subset, Random-16K, yields the shortest Average Thinking Time (1,236) and the lowest performance (48.5). This observation indicates that a larger training sample size increase the effective thinking time thereby enhancing its overall performance, despite their Mean Trajectory Length remaining nearly identical across the randomly sampled subsets (1,157 for 16K, 1,156 for 64K) and the full dataset (1,159).

##### 3.5 Test-time Scaling Comparison

To further compare the reasoning efficiency of Z1 to other models, we analyze the test-time scaling of Z1-7B and R1-Distill-Qwen-7B on three benchmarks: MATH500, GPQA, and LiveCodeBench. We equip Z1-7B with Shifted Thinking Window by imposing a cap of different maximum thinking tokens. For R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, We budget force [6] it by adding "the final answer is:", since R1-Distill-Qwen-7B can’t adapt to the shifted thinking window without long and short trajectory fine-tuning. Figure 4 illustrates the reasoning efficiency of Z1-7B compared to the baseline models, revealing the following key observations:

##### Z1-7B demonstrates more efficient test-time scaling than R1-Distill-Qwen-7B on reasoning tasks, by achieving comparable results with significantly fewer thinking tokens. Z1-7B exhibits

superior test-time scaling efficiency compared to R1-Distill-Qwen-7B on reasoning tasks, by delivering better performance with significantly fewer thinking tokens. For example, Z1-7B outperforms R1-Distill-Qwen-7B while requiring only half the average thinking time (approximately 2,000+ tokens) on the GPQA Diamond benchmark, whereas R1-Distill-Qwen-7B relies on a budget exceeding 4,096 thinking tokens. This underscores Z1-7B’s remarkable efficiency in reasoning-intensive tasks. In contrast, R1-Distill-Qwen-7B demonstrates notably weaker performance at lower average thinking times (ATT), only achieving competitive results when ATT is substantially increased.

- 3.6 Case Study

- Figure 5 illustrates a problem-solving example involving three models: Qwen2.5-Coder-7B, Z1-7B, and R1-Distill-Qwen-7B. In this instance, we present a simple problem, for which the Qwen2.5-Coder7B-Instruct model delivers a correct answer accurately. By comparison, R1-Distill-Qwen-7B adopts a context split to enforce thinking, requiring extensive deliberation that consumes 1,784 tokens before arriving at a solution. This protracted process underscores its inefficiency in optimizing thinking time for simpler tasks. Z1-7B employs the Shifted Thinking Window to effectively bypassing unnecessary overthinking within the given context, demonstrating its advantage for balancing accuracy and efficiency in problem-solving.

#### 4 Related Work

Large Reasoning Models OpenAI o1 and o3 series models [1], which get trained with large-scale RL and learn to reason using chain-of-thought [20], have demonstrated strong reasoning ability in various complex downstream tasks with consistent gains from scaling test-time compute. After the release of o1, Deepseek-R1 [2] replicates the performance of o1 through interleaved supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. The R1-Distill series models, fine-tuned on samples distilled from DeepSeek-R1, also achieve test-time scaling through non-reinforcement learning (non-RL) approaches. In the realm of non-RL data distillation training, many open-source work, such as SkyT1 [17], s1 [6], and LIMO [7] have successfully developed competitive reasoning models comparable to o1-preview. For reinforcement learning researches, models like QwQ-32B [8], Kimi-K1.5 [21], and PRIME-7B [22] have matched or even surpassed o1-preview’s performance. Our model, Z1, finetuned on 107K short and long distilled trajectory samples, employs the Shifted Thinking Window to enable weak reasoning for simple problems and strong reasoning for complex ones. Combining short and long trajectory training data and shifted thinking windows, our approach mitigates overthinking and achieves efficient test-time scaling.

scaling, has led to a divergence in model capabilities. On one hand, large reasoning models (LRMs) tailored for competitive programming (e.g., o1-Pro and o1-IOI [26]) have emerged, leveraging chainof-thought (CoT) reasoning to achieve human-level performance in programming contests. On the other hand, LLMs designed for software engineering (SE) tasks, such as Llama3-SWE-RL [27], have been developed to address benchmarks like SWE-Bench [28] and SWE-Lancer [29]. These software engineering-focused LRMs incorporate real-world SE workflows (e.g., Agentless [30]) and reinforcement learning, progressively enabling automated project management. In this work, we demonstrate that efficient test-time scaling with code can mitigate the tendency of LRMs to overthink coding problems. By optimizing thinking and answering strategies, we enhance model performance while reducing computational overhead, offering a novel perspective on the future directions of LLMs for code. Our findings contribute to both competitive programming and software engineering applications, bridging the gap between theoretical advancements and practical deployment.

#### 5 Conclusion

In this work, we introduce an efficient test-time scaling method to elicit model reasoning abilities use fewer thinking tokens consumption. We train our Z1 model with a long and short code-related trajectory dataset and equip Z1 with shifted thinking window, a new approach to enable LRM to perform weak reasoning to simple problems and strong reasoning to complex problems. Trained with long and short trajectories and reasoning with shifted thinking window, Z1 matches state-of-the-art performance with comparable parameters and demonstrates efficient test-time compute scaling on various reasoning benchmarks. Furthermore, our systematic analysis of key factors for efficient reasoning elicitation provides valuable insights for future research, contributing to the development of more advanced and open-sourced reasoning models.

#### A Dataset Details

##### A.1 Comparison of Datasets

We analyzed several recent open-source reasoning datasets. Table 3 presents several key characteristics of these datasets, including the number of samples, minimum and maximum token counts, domain, and dataset source. The Z1-Code-Reasoning dataset features shorter reasoning trajectories, which effectively enables our Z1 model to think quickly on simple problems while go into deeper reasoning on more challenging ones. This approach prevents overthinking and makes a significant contribution to achieving efficient test-time scaling.

##### A.2 Word frequency details

- In Section 2.1 and Figure 3, we analyzed the word frequency statistics of our dataset, Z1-CodeReasoning-107k, in comparison to the previous Openthought-114k dataset. We performed a statistical analysis of word frequencies at the triplet level for both datasets, with the specific top 50 word frequencies detailed in Tables 4 and 5. Due to the inclusion of reasoning data with varying trajectory lengths in our Z1-Code-Reasoning-107k dataset, there is a noticeable reduction in the overall word count. Additionally, as introduced in Section 2.1, our dataset not only contains common logical reasoning connectives but also incorporates a greater proportion of code-related content.

Table 6 provides a more detailed account of the experimental results. By varying the maximum number of thinking tokens, we assessed the test-time scaling abilities of both models across different lengths of thinking trajectories. Z1-7B demonstrated strong performance even under tighter constraints on thinking tokens, showcasing its efficient test-time scaling capability. In contrast, R1-Distill-Qwen-7B required more thinking tokens to achieve a comparable level of performance.

[Figure 36]

[Figure 37]

<think> Okay, so I have this question about absorption lines corresponding to a specific energy change, and I need to figure out which medium is most likely responsible. Let me try to break this down step by step.

To determine what is most likely to be observed given the absorption line corresponding to a change in energy level of 5.9 micro electron volts (5.9 × 10^-6 eV), we need to consider the properties of different interstellar media and how they interact with radiation.

First, let's understand the energy scale involved. The energy difference of 5.9 × 10^-6 eV is relatively small. In atomic and molecular physics, transitions between energy levels are often in the ultraviolet (UV) and visible spectrum, which correspond to energy differences of a few electron volts (eV) or less.

First, the question mentions an absorption line with an energy change of 5.9 microelectron volts, which is 5.9 x 10^-6 eV. I remember that energy levels in atoms and molecules are quantized, meaning they can only change by specific amounts. So, when an electron absorbs or emits energy, it does so in these discrete steps.

Now, let's consider each option:

I also recall that the energy of a photon is related to its wavelength by the equation E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and λ is the wavelength. But I'm not sure if I need to calculate the wavelength here or if there's a more straightforward approach.

- A. Cold atomic interstellar medium: In a cold atomic medium, atoms are in a lowtemperature state, and their electronic transitions are primarily due to UV and visible radiation. The energy difference of 5.9 × 10^-6 eV is very small, corresponding to a wavelength in the far ultraviolet (FUV) region. Absorption lines in this energy range are characteristic of atomic transitions, especially in elements like hydrogen and helium.
- B. Warm atomic interstellar medium: A warm atomic medium has higher temperatures, which can cause atoms to be in higher energy states. This could lead to transitions that are not as sensitive to the specific energy difference provided. However, the energy difference is still relatively small, so it's possible to observe absorption lines in this medium as well.
- C. Cold molecular interstellar medium: In a cold molecular medium, molecules are in a lowtemperature state, and their rotational and vibrational transitions are more prominent. Molecular transitions typically involve larger energy differences, often in the microwave and radio regions of the spectrum. The energy difference of 5.9 × 10^-6 eV is too small for molecular transitions in this context.
- D. Warm molecular interstellar medium: Similar to the warm atomic medium, a warm molecular medium has higher temperatures, which can cause molecules to be in higher energy states. This could lead to transitions that are not as sensitive to the specific energy difference provided. However, the energy difference is still relatively small, so it's possible to observe absorption lines in this medium as well.

Looking at the options, they're all about different interstellar media: cold or warm, atomic or molecular. So, I need to think about the typical energy transitions in atoms versus molecules.

In atomic transitions, electrons move between energy levels in atoms, which usually have smaller energy differences compared to molecular transitions. Molecules have more complex energy structures because they have both electronic and vibrational energy levels. So, the energy required for a transition in a molecule might be higher or lower than in an atom, depending on the specific transition.

Wait, but 5.9 microelectron volts is a very small energy. I think that in the interstellar medium, which is mostly cold, the temperatures are low. So, the thermal energy is low, meaning that only low-energy transitions can occur because higher energy transitions would require more thermal energy than is available.

In a cold medium, the electrons don't have much thermal energy, so they can only transition between energy levels that are close in energy. If the medium is warm, then the electrons have more thermal energy, so they can transition to higher energy levels more easily.

But wait, the energy change here is 5.9 microelectron volts. That's 5.9 x 10^-6 eV. I think that's a very small energy, so it's more likely to be associated with atomic transitions rather than molecular because molecular transitions usually have larger energy differences. Also, in the interstellar medium, which is mostly hydrogen, the dominant transitions are from hydrogen atoms, which have well-known spectral lines.

Given that the energy difference is 5.9 × 10^-6 eV, which is very small, it is most likely to correspond to atomic transitions in a cold medium, where such fine energy differences are more common. Molecular transitions typically involve larger energy differences, making option C less likely.

So, if it's a cold medium, the electrons can only transition between energy levels that are close, which would correspond to lower energy changes. If it's a warm medium, maybe higher energy transitions are possible, but I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Therefore, the most probable observation is in a cold atomic interstellar medium. \boxed{A}

Wait, but 5.9 microelectron volts is still a very small energy. I think that in the interstellar medium, which is cold, the typical transitions are in the microwave or radio range, which correspond to these small energy changes. For example, the 21 cm line of hydrogen is about 5.9 x 10^-6 eV, which is exactly the energy given here. So, that must be the 21 cm line, which is a transition in hydrogen atoms.

So, if the absorption line corresponds to the 21 cm transition, that's a hydrogen line, and it's observed in cold regions of the interstellar medium. So, the medium must be cold.

Looking at the options, A is cold atomic, C is cold molecular. Since hydrogen is an atom, it's option A. But wait, the question is about the medium, not the element. So, the interstellar medium is mostly cold and consists of atoms, mostly hydrogen, so the absorption line would be from cold atomic medium.

But wait, could it be molecular? Molecular lines usually have different energy transitions. For example, rotational transitions in molecules have higher energy differences compared to atomic transitions, but I'm not sure. The 21 cm line is definitely an atomic transition.

So, putting it all together, the energy corresponds to the 21 cm line, which is a hydrogen atom transition. Since the interstellar medium is cold, the medium is cold and atomic. So, the answer should be A. </think>

The absorption line corresponds to a 21 cm transition in hydrogen atoms, which is a very small energy change of 5.9 x 10^-6 eV. This energy is characteristic of the 21 cm line, typically observed in cold interstellar media. Since hydrogen is an atomic element, the medium is cold and atomic.

Answer: A. Cold atomic interstellar medium. \boxed{A}

<think> Okay, so I have this density matrix given by ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). I need to figure out its geometrical position in the qubit space. The options are A through D, each with different coordinates. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used in quantum mechanics to describe the state of a system, especially when it's mixed or entangled. But I'm a bit fuzzy on how to visualize this in the qubit space.

To determine the geometrical position of the given density matrix in the qubits space, we need to understand the relationship between density matrices and Bloch vectors in quantum mechanics.

First, recall that for a single qubit, the density matrix can be expressed in terms of the Bloch vector \(\mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) as:

First, let me recall that a single qubit can be represented in a Bloch sphere, which is a geometrical representation of the state of a qubit. The Bloch sphere is a unit sphere in threedimensional space, where each point corresponds to a possible state of the qubit. The pure states are represented by points on the surface of the sphere, while mixed states are inside the sphere.

\[ \rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \mathbb{I} + \mathbf{r} \cdot \mathbf{\sigma} \right) \]

where \(\mathbb{I}\) is the identity matrix and \(\mathbf{\sigma} = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z)\) are the Pauli matrices.

The density matrix given here is ρ = (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. Wait, that looks familiar. Isn't that the density matrix for a completely mixed state? Because when you have a completely mixed state, the density matrix is the identity matrix divided by the dimension of the space. For a qubit, which is a two-level system, the identity matrix is 2x2, so dividing by 2 gives us exactly this ρ.

Given the density matrix: \[ \rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( |0\rangle \langle 0| + |1\rangle \langle 1| \right) \] we can see that this is a diagonal matrix with equal probabilities for the states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\). This corresponds to a maximally mixed state. To find the Bloch vector \(\mathbf{r}\), we can use the expression for \(\rho\) in terms of \(\mathbf{r}\): \[ \rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \mathbb{I} + \mathbf{r} \cdot \mathbf{\sigma} \right) \] Given that \(\rho\) is: \[ \rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( |0\rangle \langle 0| + |1\rangle \langle 1| \right) = \frac{1}{2} \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} \] we can equate this to the Bloch vector expression: \[ \frac{1}{2} \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} = \frac{1}{2} \left( \mathbb{I} + \mathbf{r} \cdot \mathbf{\sigma} \right) \] This implies: \[ \mathbb{I} = \mathbb{I} + \mathbf{r} \cdot \mathbf{\sigma} \] Subtracting \(\mathbb{I}\) from both sides: \[ 0 = \mathbf{r} \cdot \mathbf{\sigma} \] This means that the Bloch vector \(\mathbf{r}\) is orthogonal to all Pauli matrices, which is only possible if \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\). Therefore, the geometrical position of the density matrix in the qubits space is at the origin. \boxed{A}

But how does this correspond to a point in the qubit space? I think the completely mixed state should correspond to the center of the Bloch sphere, right? Because the center is the average of all possible pure states. So, in the Bloch sphere, the center is at (0,0,0). Let me check if that makes sense.

In the Bloch sphere representation, a pure state |ψ⟩ can be written as |ψ⟩ = cos(θ/2)|0⟩ + e^{iφ} sin(θ/2)|1⟩. The corresponding density matrix is |ψ⟩⟨ψ|. The Bloch vector for this state is (x, y, z) where x = sinθ cosφ, y = sinθ sinφ, and z = cosθ. So, for the pure states, the Bloch vector has a magnitude of 1, which places it on the surface of the sphere.

But for the mixed state, since it's a completely mixed state, it doesn't have a definite phase or any coherence. So, it's like averaging over all possible states. That should correspond to the origin, which is (0,0,0) in the Bloch sphere. So, the density matrix ρ given here is the completely mixed state, which is at the center of the Bloch sphere.

Looking back at the options, A is (0,0,0), which would be the center. The other options are points on the surface or different points inside the sphere. Since the completely mixed state is at the center, the answer should be A.

Wait, let me make sure I'm not confusing anything. The density matrix for a mixed state is diagonal in the computational basis, which this one is. So, it's a classical mixture of |0⟩ and |1⟩, each with probability 1/2. In the Bloch sphere, a diagonal density matrix corresponds to a state with no coherence, meaning no y-component in the Bloch vector. So, the Bloch vector should lie along the z-axis. But since it's a completely mixed state, the z-component is zero as well. So, the Bloch vector is (0,0,0), which is the center.

Yes, that makes sense. So, the geometrical position is the origin, which is option A.

**Final Answer** \boxed{A} </think>

The given density matrix is \[ \rho = \frac{1}{2}\left(\left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right|\right) \] This density matrix represents a completely mixed state. In the context of a qubit, a completely mixed state corresponds to the center of the Bloch sphere. The Bloch sphere is a geometrical representation where pure states lie on the surface, and mixed states lie inside. The completely mixed state, being an average of all possible pure states, is at the origin of the Bloch sphere, which corresponds to the point (0,0,0). Thus, the geometrical position of the given density matrix in the qubit space is the origin.

\[ \boxed{A} \]

Question:

Given an array of strings words and a string s, determine if s is an acronym of words. The string s is considered an acronym of words if it can be formed by concatenating the first character of each string in words in order. For example, "ab" can be formed from ["apple", "banana"], but it can't be formed from ["bear", "aardvark"]. Return true if s is an acronym of words, and false otherwise.

[Three examples omitted …] Constraints: 1 <= words.length <= 100 1 <= words[i].length <= 10 1 <= s.length <= 100 words[i] and s consist of lowercase English letters.

[Figure 42]

[Figure 43]

R1-Distill-Qwen-7B Z1-7B

[Figure 44]

[Figure 45]

<think> Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to determine if a given string s is an acronym of an array of words. Hmm, let's think about what that means. So, an acronym is formed by taking the first character of each word in the array and concatenating them in order. So, for example, if the words are ["apple", "banana"], the acronym would be "ab". So, the task is to check if the string s exactly matches this concatenated first characters. If it does, return True; otherwise, False. Let me look at the examples to make sure I understand.

To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string `s` is an acronym of an array of strings `words`. An acronym is formed by concatenating the first character of each string in the array in order. We need to check if `s` matches this acronym.

## Approach

- 1. **Length Check**: First, we check if the length of `s` is equal to the number of words in the array. If not, it cannot be an acronym, so we return `false`.
- 2. **Acronym Formation**: If the lengths match, we form the acronym by taking the first character of each word in the array.
- 3. **Comparison**: We then compare this formed acronym with `s`. If they are equal, we return `true`; otherwise, we return `false`.

- In Example 1, words are ["alice", "bob", "charlie"], and s is "abc". The first letters are 'a', 'b', 'c', so s is "abc", which matches. So it returns True.
- In Example 2, words are ["an", "apple"], so the first letters are 'a' and 'a', making "aa". But s is "a", so it's shorter, hence False.
- In Example 3, the words are ["never", "gonna", "give", "up", "on", "you"], so the first letters are 'n', 'g', 'g', 'u', 'o', 'y', which makes "ngguoy". The s given is exactly that, so it's True. So, the approach is to … [231 tokens omitted]

## Solution Code ```python class Solution:

def isAcronym(self, words: List[str], s: str) -> bool: if len(s) != len(words):

return False acronym = ''.join([word[0] for word in words]) return acronym == s

Wait, but what about the lengths? For example, if the concatenated string is longer than s, or shorter. Well, the comparison will handle that automatically. So, the code would be something like:

``` ## Explanation

def isAcronym(self, words: List[str], s: str) -> bool: # get the first characters acronym = ''.join([word[0] for word in words]) return acronym == s

- - **Step 1**: We check if the length of `s` is equal to the number of words. If not, we immediately return `false` because the acronym cannot match.
- - **Step 2**: We create the acronym by taking the first character of each word in the array using a list comprehension and joining them into a string.
- - **Step 3**: We compare the formed acronym with `s`. If they are equal, we return `true`; otherwise, we return `false`.

That seems straightforward. Let me test this logic against the examples.

Example 1: … [320 tokens omitted] I think this should work. </think>

This approach ensures that we efficiently check the conditions in a straightforward manner, adhering to the problem constraints.

To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string `s` is an acronym of an array of words. An acronym is formed by concatenating the first character of each word in the array in order.

### Approach

- 1. **Extract First Characters**: For each word in the given list, extract the first character.
- 2. **Concatenate Characters**: Join these first characters into a single string.
- 3. **Compare Strings**: Check if this concatenated string matches the given string `s`.

This approach ensures that we correctly form the acronym by taking the first character of each word and then comparing it directly to the given string `s`.

### Solution Code ```python class Solution:

def isAcronym(self, words: List[str], s: str) -> bool: acronym = ''.join([word[0] for word in words]) return acronym == s

``` ### Explanation

- 1. **Extract First Characters**: We use a list comprehension to iterate over each word in the list `words` and extract the first character using `word[0]`.
- 2. **Concatenate Characters**: The list of first characters is then joined into a single string using `''.join()`.
- 3. **Compare Strings**: Finally, we compare the concatenated string to the input string `s`. If they are equal, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

This solution efficiently checks if `s` is an acronym by leveraging simple string operations, ensuring clarity and correctness.

Question:

Order Something Else Takahashi wants a beverage called AtCoder Drink in a restaurant. It can be ordered at a regular price of P yen. He also has a discount coupon that allows him to order it at a lower price of Q yen. However, he must additionally order one of the restaurant's N dishes to use that coupon. For each i = 1, 2, \ldots, N, the price of the i-th dish is D_i yen. Print the minimum total amount of money that he must pay to get the drink. The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

[Constraints and Examples omitted …] The total payment will be minimized by not using the coupon and paying the regular price of 100 yen.

[Figure 46]

[Figure 47]

R1-Distill-Qwen-7B Z1-7B

[Figure 48]

[Figure 49]

To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum total amount of money Takahashi must pay to get the AtCoder Drink, considering both the regular price and the discounted price with a coupon.

The minimum between P and (Q + min(D_i)). Yes, because using the coupon with the cheapest dish gives the lowest possible coupon cost. So that's the way to go. So the plan is:

### Approach

- 1. **Understand the Problem:**

- - The drink costs P yen regularly.
- - With a coupon, it costs Q yen, but he must order one of the N dishes.
- - Each dish has a price D_i.

- 2. **Identify the Options:**

- - Option 1: Pay the regular price P yen.
- - Option 2: Use the coupon to pay Q yen and choose one dish.

- 3. **Minimize the Cost:**

- - To minimize the total cost, choose the option with the lower total payment.
- - The total cost for the coupon option is Q plus the price of the cheapest dish.

- 4. **Edge Cases:**

- - Read N, P, Q.
- - Read the list of D_i.
- - Find the minimum D_i.
- - Compute the coupon cost as Q + min_D.
- - The answer is the minimum between P and coupon_cost.

Wait, but what if Q is less than P? Then, using the coupon might be better, but only if the sum is less than P.

- - If Q is greater than or equal to P, it's always better to pay the regular price.
- - If Q is less than P, compare Q plus the minimum dish price with P.

Wait, no. Because if Q is less than P, but adding the min D_i makes it more than P, then it's better not to use the coupon.

### Solution Code ```python # Read input values import sys input = sys.stdin.read data = input().split() N = int(data[0])

So the correct approach is to compute the minimum between P and (Q + min(D_i)). Yes. Let me test this logic against the sample inputs. Sample Input 1: [637 tokens omitted] So the code should handle all cases correctly. I think that's the solution. </think>

- P = int(data[1])
- Q = int(data[2]) D = list(map(int, data[3:]))

# Find the minimum dish price min_d = min(D)

To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum amount of money Takahashi must pay to get a drink and a dish, considering he can use a discount coupon. The solution involves comparing the cost of using the coupon with the cost of not using it.

# Calculate the minimum total cost if Q + min_d < P:

min_cost = Q + min_d else:

### Approach

min_cost = P

- 1. **Understand the Problem**: Takahashi can buy a drink at a regular price of P yen or use a coupon to pay Q yen for the drink, but he must also order one dish. The goal is to find the minimum total cost.
- 2. **Calculate Costs**:

- - The cost without using the coupon is simply P yen.
- - The cost using the coupon is Q yen plus the price of the cheapest dish.

- 3. **Comparison**: Compare the cost of using the coupon (Q + minimum dish price) with the regular price P to determine the cheaper option.

# Print the result print(min_cost) ```

### Explanation

- 1. **Input Handling:**

- Read the input values for N, P, Q, and the list of dish prices D.

- 2. **Find the Minimum Dish Price:**

- Use the `min` function to find the cheapest dish.

- 3. **Calculate the Minimum Total Cost:**

- - Compare the total cost of using the coupon (Q + min_d) with the regular price P.
- - Choose the smaller of the two.

- 4. **Output the Result:**

### Solution Code ```python n, p, q = map(int, input().split()) dishes = list(map(int, input().split())) min_dish = min(dishes) coupon_cost = q + min_dish print(min(p, coupon_cost)) ```

### Explanation

- Print the minimum total cost.

- 1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of dishes, the regular price of the drink, the coupon price, and the prices of the dishes.
- 2. **Finding Minimum Dish Price**: Calculate the minimum price among the list of dish prices.
- 3. **Calculate Coupon Cost**: Compute the total cost if the coupon is used, which is the coupon price plus the cheapest dish price.
- 4. **Determine Minimum Cost**: Compare the total cost using the coupon with the regular price of the drink and print the smaller value.

This approach ensures that we always choose the option with the lowest possible total cost, considering both the regular and coupon options.

This approach ensures that we efficiently find the minimum cost by leveraging the minimum dish price to minimize the coupon cost, thus providing an optimal solution.

Question:

|If $2^8=4^x$, what is the value of $x$?|
|---|

[Figure 50]

[Figure 51]

R1-Distill-Qwen-7B Z1-7B

[Figure 52]

[Figure 53]

<think> Okay, so I have this equation here: 2^8 equals 4^x. Hmm, I need to find the value of x. Let me think about how to approach this. I remember that when dealing with exponential equations, it's often helpful to express both sides with the same base. That way, I can set the exponents equal to each other and solve for the unknown.

To solve the equation \(2^8 = 4^x\) for \(x\), we can follow these steps:

- 1. **Express both sides with the same base:**

- - Notice that both 2 and 4 can be expressed as powers of 2.
- - We know that \(4 = 2^2\), so \(4^x = (2^2)^x\).

- 2. **Simplify the right-hand side:**

- - Using the property of exponents \((a^m)^n = a^{m \cdot n}\), we can rewrite \(4^x\) as \(2^{2x}\).
- - Therefore, the equation becomes \(2^8 = 2^{2x}\).

- 3. **Set the exponents equal to each other:**

- - Since the bases are the same, we can set the exponents equal to each other.
- - This gives us \(8 = 2x\).

- 4. **Solve for \(x\):**

- - Divide both sides of the equation by 2 to isolate \(x\).
- - \(x = \frac{8}{2} = 4\).

- 5. **Verify the solution:**

First, let me write down the equation again to make sure I have it right: 2^8 = 4^x. So, on the left side, the base is 2, and on the right side, the base is 4. I know that 4 is a power of 2, specifically 4 is 2 squared. So, maybe I can rewrite 4 as 2^2. Let me try that.

If I substitute 4 with 2^2, the equation becomes 2^8 = (2^2)^x. Now, I remember that when you have an exponent raised to another exponent, you can multiply them. So, (2^2)^x is the same as 2^(2*x). Let me write that down: 2^8 = 2^(2x).

Now that both sides have the same base, which is 2, I can set the exponents equal to each other. That means 8 should equal 2x. So, 8 = 2x. To solve for x, I just need to divide both sides by 2. Let me do that: 8 divided by 2 is 4, so x equals 4.

Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. If x is 4, then 4^x is 4^4. Let me calculate both sides of the original equation to verify. On the left side, 2^8 is 256. On the right side, 4^4 is also 256 because 4*4 is 16, 16*4 is 64, and 64*4 is 256. Yep, both sides are equal, so x must indeed be 4.

- - Substitute \(x = 4\) back into the original equation to check.
- - Left side: \(2^8 = 256\)
- - Right side: \(4^4 = (2^2)^4 = 2^{8} = 256\)
- - Both sides are equal, confirming that \(x = 4\) is correct.

I think that's it. I converted the base 4 into base 2, which allowed me to equate the exponents and solve for x. It all checks out. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I'm confident that x is 4.

Therefore, the value of \(x\) is \(\boxed{4}\).

**Final Answer** The value of \( x \) is \boxed{4}. </think>

Given the equation \(2^8 = 4^x\), we need to find the value of \(x\). First, we express both sides with the same base. We know that \(4\) can be written as \(2^2\). Substituting this into the equation, we get: \[ 2^8 = (2^2)^x \] Using the property of exponents \((a^m)^n = a^{mn}\), we can rewrite the right side: \[ 2^8 = 2^{2x} \] Since the bases are the same, we can set the exponents equal to each other: \[ 8 = 2x \] Solving for \(x\), we divide both sides by 2: \[ x = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \] Thus, the value of \(x\) is \(\boxed{4}\).

Question:

In the equation $|x-4| -10 = 2$, what is the product of all possible values of $x$?

[Figure 54]

[Figure 55]

R1-Distill-Qwen-7B Z1-7B

[Figure 56]

[Figure 57]

<think> Okay, so I have this equation here: |x - 4| - 10 = 2. Hmm, I need to find the product of all possible values of x. Alright, let me think about how to approach this step by step.

To solve the equation \( |x-4| - 10 = 2 \), we need to isolate the absolute value expression and then consider the two cases that arise from the definition of absolute value.

First, let's isolate the absolute value term: \[ |x-4| - 10 = 2 \] Add 10 to both sides: \[ |x-4| = 12 \] Now, the absolute value equation \( |x-4| = 12 \) means that the expression inside the absolute value can be either 12 or -12. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:

First, I remember that absolute value equations can have two solutions because the expression inside the absolute value can be either positive or negative. So, I should probably solve for both cases. But let me start by isolating the absolute value term.

The equation is |x - 4| - 10 = 2. To isolate |x - 4|, I can add 10 to both sides. Let me write that down:

|x - 4| - 10 + 10 = 2 + 10 Simplifying both sides, that becomes: |x - 4| = 12 Okay, so now I have … [554 tokens omitted]

- **Case 1:** \( x - 4 = 12 \) Solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 12 + 4 \] \[ x = 16 \]

- **Case 2:** \( x - 4 = -12 \) Solve for \( x \):

**Final Answer** The product of all possible values of \( x \) is \boxed{-128}. </think>

To solve the equation \(|x - 4| - 10 = 2\), we start by isolating the absolute value term. First, add 10 to both sides: \[ |x - 4| - 10 + 10 = 2 + 10 \] \[ |x - 4| = 12 \] This absolute value equation results in two separate equations:

\[ x = -12 + 4 \] \[ x = -8 \]

- 1. \(x - 4 = 12\)
- 2. \(x - 4 = -12\)

Solving the first equation: \[ x - 4 = 12 \] \[ x = 12 + 4 \] \[ x = 16 \]

So, the two possible values for \( x \) are 16 and -8. Next, we need to find the product of all possible values of \( x \). The product is: \[ 16 \times (-8) = -128 \] Therefore, the product of all possible values of \( x \) is \(\boxed{-128}\).

Solving the second equation: \[ x - 4 = -12 \] \[ x = -12 + 4 \] \[ x = -8 \]

The two possible values of \(x\) are 16 and -8. The product of these values is: \[ 16 \times (-8) = -128 \]

Thus, the product of all possible values of \(x\) is \(\boxed{-128}\).
