Abstract
We show that Fréchet Distance (FD), long considered impractical as a training
objective, can in fact be effectively optimized in the representation space. Our
idea is simple: decouple the population size for FD estimation (e.g., 50k) from the
batch size for gradient computation (e.g., 1024). We term this approach FD-loss.
Optimizing FD-loss reveals several surprising findings. First, post-training a base
generator with FD-loss in different representation spaces consistently improves
visual quality. Under the Inception feature space, a one-step generator achieves
0.72 FID on ImageNet 256×256. Second, the same FD-loss repurposes multi-step
generators into strong one-step generators without teacher distillation, adversarial
training or per-sample targets. Third, FID can misrank visual quality: modern
representations can yield better samples despite worse Inception FID. This mo-
tivates FDrk, a multi-representation metric. We hope this work will encourage
further exploration of distributional distances in diverse representation spaces as
both training objectives and evaluation metrics for generative models. Code and
checkpoints are available at https://github.com/Jiawei-Yang/FD-loss.

Introduction
The Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) [17] has been the de facto metric for evaluating image genera-
tion, especially on academic benchmarks such as ImageNet [5]. For nearly a decade, the community
has been collectively performing “gradient descent” on this single metric to push the state of the art.
But this “gradient descent” has always been indirect: FID serves only as an evaluator, not as a loss.
In this paper, we ask: can FID be optimized directly as a training loss—and what does that reveal?

Figure 2: FD-loss. The generator produces B images
per step; their features are accumulated into a large
population via a queue or EMA. This decouples the
population size N for reliable FD estimation from
the batch size B for gradient computation.
In principle, this is straightforward: every term in Fréchet Distance (FD) is differentiable and nothing
in its definition restricts it to evaluation. In practice, however, this has been widely considered im-
practical. Computing FID requires a large population of samples (e.g., 50k) to estimate distributional
statistics. Using it as a training loss would further demand gradients through all of them at every step,
which is prohibitive. Prior work has therefore only explored FD as a loss under restricted settings,
e.g., estimating FD from a small batch [34, 8]. Our experiments confirm that optimizing batch-wise
FD degrades base generators (Tab. 1a).
In this work, we show that FD can in fact be optimized directly at scale. Our idea is simple (Fig. 2):
decouple the population size used for FD estimation from the batch size used for gradient computation.
We call this approach FD-loss and realize it in two ways. The first maintains an online queue of
features from recently generated samples and computes FD over the full queue (e.g., 50k) while
back-propagating only through the current batch. The second maintains exponential moving averages
(EMA) of the first and second moments of features and restricts gradients to the current batch. Both
work well in practice. This one approach unlocks several surprising findings.
First, FD-loss is a strong post-training objective for visual generators. We fine-tune a pre-trained
generator with FD-loss using only pre-computed feature statistics—means and covariances of real
data under one or more representation backbones.1 Across pixel-space and latent-space generator
families [30, 12, 23], model sizes, and image resolutions, this consistently improves visual quality.
Under Inception [47], FD-loss drives a one-step generator [30] to an FID of 0.72 on ImageNet
256 × 256 (Tab. 4). The same recipe, applied under modern representations [27, 15, 38, 40, 48],
yields even stronger perceptual quality (Fig. 4, Tab. 3).
Second, FD-loss serves as a simple distribution-matching objective. We show that a pre-trained multi-
step generator can be repurposed into a one-step generator by post-training it with FD-loss (from
around 300 FID to 0.72). This repurposing works without teacher distillation, adversarial training, or
per-sample targets, suggesting that the representation-space FD is a useful distribution-level objective
rather than only an evaluation metric. We validate this on both class-conditioned models (Fig. 1,
bottom) and text-conditioned models (Fig. 7).
Third, FD-loss provides a diagnostic lens. Having models trained by FD-loss with different represen-
tations, we can test whether the best-FID model is also the perceptually best. Often, it is not: models
optimized with modern representations achieve better visual quality while scoring worse under FID
(Tab. 1c, Fig. 4). More broadly, this connects to a paradox in the field (Fig. 3): state-of-the-art genera-
tors already surpass real validation images under FID, yet their outputs remain clearly distinguishable
from real images. We therefore report FDrk, a normalized FD ratio averaged over k feature spaces
(Eq. 8), as a more representation-diverse automatic metric. As shown in Figure 3, FID suggests the
“ImageNet generation” problem is nearly solved, yet FDrk reveals that significant quality gaps remain.
Post-training with FD-loss narrows this gap, achieving an FDr6 of 1.89.
Taken together, our findings reposition FD in generative modeling. FD has long lived on one side of
the generative modeling pipeline, i.e., evaluation. We show it is also useful on the other side, i.e.,
training. The two sides turn out to be linked: making FD as a loss both improves generators and
exposes the limits of any single FD as an evaluator. We hope the simplicity of FD-loss will encourage
the community to rethink both how we train and how we evaluate generative models.

Related Work
Fréchet Distance as an evaluation metric. FID [17] is the dominant metric for evaluating image
generation. A growing body of work has highlighted its limitations [42, 21, 20, 46, 19], motivating
alternatives such as precision–recall [42, 21], CKA [53], and MMD [19]. We make FD directly
optimizable as a training loss, which both probes the reliability of FID and motivates our FDrk metric.

Fréchet Distance as a training loss. Distributional distances as training objectives date back to
adversarial learning [13], MMD-based generators [25, 2, 60, 6], and sliced Wasserstein objectives [7].
More closely related, several works train generators by matching feature-space moments [36, 44],
or by minimizing FD in Inception [34] or discriminator [8] feature space. The main limitation of
existing FD optimization work is statistical scale: their FD estimates are computed within a single
batch and become too noisy to scale up. Our work makes FD optimization practical at scale.
Optimizing over broader sample windows. A recurring difficulty in modern deep learning op-
timization is that some objectives require a much larger effective sample set than a single batch
provides. In contrastive learning, this motivates memory banks [52] and feature queues [16]. Deep
networks have also long used exponential moving averages (EMA) to maintain stable estimates of
population statistics, e.g., Batch Normalization [18]. Our work adopts a similar principle: we compute
FD over a queue of recent features or EMA estimates of feature moments, while back-propagating
only through the current batch.
One-step generators and post-training. Modern high-quality image generators often rely on
multi-step denoising [39, 9, 24, 59, 35]. This has motivated more efficient one-step or few-step
generators, including straightening ODEs [26], consistency models [45, 29], score distillation [31, 32,
56, 61], identity-based methods [11, 12, 30], and drifting models [6]. Our work is complementary:
optimizing FD in capable representation spaces is a powerful and new way to improve existing
one-step generators [30, 12] and to repurpose multi-step generators [23, 9] into one-step ones, in both
pixel and latent space, without denoising teacher distillation or adversarial training. This positions
FD not only as an evaluation tool, but also as a practical post-training objective.

Method
We study using Fréchet Distance (FD) as a training objective for post-training image generators. We
begin by outlining the challenges of directly optimizing FD, and then present our method for making
this practical at scale.
3.1
Preliminaries: Fréchet Distance
Let ϕ(·) denote a feature extractor. Given real images R = {xi} and generated images G = {ˆxi},
their feature distributions are modeled as multivariate Gaussians with means and covariances:
µr = E[ϕ(x)],
Σr = Cov[ϕ(x)],
µg = E[ϕ(ˆx)],
Σg = Cov[ϕ(ˆx)].
(1)
The FD between the two Gaussian distributions is:
FDϕ(R, G) = ∥µr −µg∥2
2 + Tr

Σr + Σg −2(ΣrΣg)
1
2

.
(2)
When ϕ is Inception-v3 [47], this becomes the Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) [17].
In standard evaluation, (µr, Σr) are pre-computed once from the training set, while (µg, Σg) are
estimated from a large population of generated samples, typically on the order of tens of thousands.
3

Challenges. Unlike sample-wise losses, FD is a distributional quantity. Directly optimizing FD is
difficult because the population size needed for reliable estimation (e.g., 50k) far exceeds a typical
training batch (e.g., 64 to 1024). Small-batch estimates are unstable, especially for high-dimensional
features. For example, reliably estimating a full-rank covariance matrix (Σg ∈R2048×2048) for
Inception [47] requires far more than 2048 samples. At the same time, back-propagating through a
full evaluation-sized population at every training step is computationally infeasible for most practical
setups.2 The central problem is therefore to estimate FD using a large effective population while
keeping the cost of optimization at the scale of an affordable training batch.
3.2
FD-loss: Decoupling Population Scale from Optimization Scale
Our key idea is decoupling: we estimate FD using statistics aggregated over a much broader sample
window than the current batch, while computing gradients with respect to the current batch alone
(Fig. 2). We consider two implementations, introduced below and summarized in Algorithm 1.
Algorithm 1 Post-Training with FD-loss.
# G: generator
# phi: frozen representation model
# (mu_r, sig_r): real feature statistics
# (mu_ema, M_ema): EMA mean and 2nd moment
# beta: EMA decay
# z: current batch of noise
x = G(z)
feat = phi(x)
feat = all_gather(feat) # gather across devices
# Queue version:
# gen_feats = cat([queue.detach(), feat])
# mu_g, sig_g = compute_stats(gen_feats)
# EMA version:
mu_b, M_b = batch_moments(feat)
mu_g = beta * mu_ema.detach() + (1 - beta) * mu_b
M_g = beta * M_ema.detach() + (1 - beta) * M_b
sig_g = M_g - mu_g @ mu_g.T
loss = FD((mu_g, sig_g), (mu_r, sig_r))
loss.backward()
optimizer.step()
# Queue version:
# queue.enqueue_and_dequeue(feat.detach())
# EMA version
mu_ema = mu_g.detach()
M_ema = M_g.detach()
Queue-based estimator. Let N denote the queue
size, which determines the effective population
used for statistics estimation (e.g., N = 100, 000).
At each training iteration, the generator produces
a batch of B images, where B ≪N (e.g., B =
1024). We extract their features using a represen-
tation model ϕ and enqueue them, while removing
the oldest B features. FD is computed using the
empirical mean and covariance of the full queue.
During back-propagation, only the current batch
features carry gradients; queued features from pre-
vious iterations are treated as constants. This is sim-
ilar in spirit to the queue in MoCo [16]. The dynam-
ically updated queue makes the feature statistics
on-policy. This implementation already enables us
to achieve 0.89 FID with 50 epochs post-training
using a 118M-sized model on ImageNet 256 × 256
(Tab. 1a).
EMA-based estimator. We also consider an ap-
proach that avoids storing feature queues entirely.
Concretely, we maintain exponential moving av-
erages (EMA) of the first and second feature mo-
ments. Let β ∈(0, 1) denote the EMA decay rate,
and µ(t)
g
and M(t)
g
denote the running estimates of
the first and second moment at iteration t. Given the
features of images generated in the current batch
{ϕ(ˆxi)}B
i=1, we define the batch moments as:
µ(t)
batch = 1
B
B
X
i=1
ϕ(ˆxi),
M(t)
batch = 1
B
B
X
i=1
ϕ(ˆxi) ϕ(ˆxi)⊤,
(3)
and update the running estimates as:
µ(t)
g
= βµ(t−1)
g
+ (1 −β)µ(t)
batch,
M(t)
g
= βM(t−1)
g
+ (1 −β)M(t)
batch,
(4)
and recover the covariance from
Σ(t)
g
= M(t)
g
−µ(t)
g µ(t)⊤
g
.
(5)
FD is then computed using (µ(t)
g , Σ(t)
g ) via Equation 2, with gradients back-propagated only through
the current batch. Unlike the queue, this variant stores no feature buffer, making it more scalable
when using multiple representation models. It also provides a more on-policy estimate since EMA
naturally upweights recent samples. This enables the base model to achieve 0.81 FID under the same
post-training procedure (Tab. 1b).
2Admittedly, this challenge would likely vanish if one could use a batch size of 100,000, which is rarely practical but not
entirely impossible.
4

Discussion. Both variants implement the same decoupling principle (§3.2). The queue uses an
explicit window controlled by N; the EMA uses a smoothed estimate controlled by β. Both work
well in practice; each trades off population size against how on-policy the statistics remain.
Multi-representation FD-loss. Our FD-loss naturally supports minimizing FD measured in different
representation spaces. In practice, FD can vary by orders of magnitude across representation models.
To combine losses from multiple representations {ϕi}, we normalize each term:
L = P
iwi · Lϕi,
Lϕi =
FDϕi(R, G)
sg(FDϕi(R, G)) + c,
(6)
where sg(·) denotes stop-gradient, c is a small constant for numerical stability, and wi are per-
representation weights. This makes each term unit-scale regardless of the feature space. For
simplicity, we also do normalization even when there is only one representation model. In this work,
we simply use equal weights with wi = 1.
3.3
Training setup
We apply our FD-loss for post-training. In all cases, we start from a pre-trained generator, called the
base model, and fine-tune it with the FD-loss.
Post-training one-step generators. Our primary setting is post-training existing one-step generators
with FD-loss. In practice, it is desirable to improve sample quality while preserving fast generation.
We therefore study both pixel-space one-step generators, such as pixel-MeanFlow (pMF) [30],
and latent-space one-step generators, such as improved-MeanFlow (iMF) [12], to demonstrate the
versatility of our method.
Repurposing multi-step generators. Surprisingly, we find that the FD-loss, when measured in
capable representation spaces, can repurpose a pre-trained multi-step generator into a one-step
generator. Concretely, given Gaussian noise z, we run the model only once at the terminal timestep
and interpret its output as a one-step prediction of the clean image. For example, ˆx0 = z−vθ(z, t=1)
for a velocity-prediction model (e.g., SiT [33] and MMDiT [9]), and ˆx0 = xθ(z, t=1) for an x0-
prediction model (e.g., JiT [23]), assuming zt=1 is pure Gaussian noise. A multi-step model used this
way initially produces poor samples (e.g., 290 FID), since it was never trained for one-step generation.
We simply treat it as a one-step generator and optimize it with the FD-loss. This procedure can
transform multi-step generators into competitive one-step generators, without adversarial training or
teacher distillation. In this sense, FD-loss provides a minimalistic distribution matching objective.
3.4
FDrk: Normalized Fréchet Distance Ratios under K Models
Metric paradox. If measured only by FID [17], state-of-the-art image generators appear to have
already surpassed real validation images. As shown in Figure 3, when evaluated against ImageNet
training images, validation images themselves obtain FID 1.68,3 while many recent works report FID
around or below 1.5 [57, 58, 59, 24, 54, 50, 55]. Yet, generated images are still clearly distinguishable
from real ones. This disconnect between metric and visual quality suggests that FID, which relies on
a single, dated feature space, has saturated as a quality signal.
FD ratio. A natural remedy is to evaluate across diverse feature spaces. However, raw FD values are
not comparable across representations (e.g., FD-MAE and FD-DINOv2 differ by orders of magnitude;
see Tab. F.7). To obtain comparable quantities, we normalize the FD of generated images by the
FD of real validation images in the same feature space. Let T denote the ImageNet training set, V
the validation set, and G a set of generated images. For a representation model ϕi, we define the
normalized FD ratio, abbreviated as FDr:
FDrϕi(G) = FDϕi(G, T )
FDϕi(V, T ).
(7)
This ratio is unitless and has a direct interpretation. For example, FDrϕi = 2.0 means that under ϕi,
the generated images are perceptually twice as far from the training set as the validation images. By
definition, validation images score exactly 1.0.
3For ImageNet, FID is computed against training set statistics. Therefore, the FID of validation images is not zero.
5

FDrK. We define FDrk by averaging these normalized ratios over K representation models:
FDrK(G) = 1
K
K
X
i=1
FDrϕi(G).
(8)
This yields a single multi-representation metric while preserving the interpretation of the per-model
ratios. Existing strong generators may beat validation images in Inception [47] feature space alone,
but remain substantially inferior once evaluated across diverse representations (Tabs. 4, F.6, F.7).
In this paper, we instantiate FDrk with 6 representative models spanning supervised, self-supervised,
and vision-language objectives across both CNN and ViT architectures: Inception-v3 [47], ConvNeXt-
v2 [27], DINOv2 [38], MAE [15], SigLIP2 [48], and CLIP [40]. Details are in Appendix B.1.
Scope. FDr6 should not be viewed as a north star, nor as a replacement for human evaluation, but
rather as a more robust automatic metric than FID alone. It retains the simplicity of Fréchet-style
evaluation while reducing the blind spots of any single representation. Like any automatic metric,
FDrk has its own limitations: its value depends on the choice of K representations, and it still inherits
the Gaussian moment-matching assumption of Fréchet Distance itself. We view it as a step forward
from FID, not a final answer. We provide more discussions in Appendix A.

Experiments
Setup. We study class-conditional image generation on ImageNet-1k [5] at 256×256 and 512×512
resolutions. Our experiments cover both pixel-space generators (pMF [30], JiT [23]) and latent-space
generators (iMF [12]). All methods are reimplemented and integrated in a unified codebase for fair
comparison; all models are initialized from officially released pre-trained weights. We evaluate using
FID [17] and IS [43] to facilitate comparison with prior work. We also report FDr6 as defined in
Equation 8. Following standard practice, all metrics are computed from 50,000 generated images
against training set statistics. We also report metrics for 50,000 validation images as a reference.
Training. We post-train with a global batch size of 1024 using AdamW [28] with a cosine lr schedule
and 5 epochs of warm-up. We set lr=10−6 for pMF [30] and iMF [12], and lr=10−5 for JiT [23].
For ablation experiments, we post-train for 50 epochs; for system-level results, 100 epochs.
4.1
Properties of Population Size in FD-loss
We first analyze the importance of population size when optimizing FD-loss. Unless stated otherwise,
we post-train pMF-B/16 [30] for 50 epochs using Inception [47] as the only representation model.
Population size via queue size. Table 1a studies the effect of the queue size N. Without a queue
(N=0), statistics are estimated from the current batch only, which degrades all metrics relative to
the base model (FID: 3.31→3.84, FDr6: 13.70→17.06). Performance improves steadily when using
queue size from 5k to 50k (FID 0.89, FDr6 10.91), but degrades beyond 100k as cached features
become increasingly off-policy, and the stale statistics outweigh the benefit of a larger population.
Notably, at 500k the queue becomes overly stale that FID and FDr6 disagree: FID still improves over
the base model (1.22 vs. 3.31), whereas FDr6 degrades beyond the base model (17.67 vs. 13.70). This
is an early sign that FID alone can be misleading.
Population size via EMA decay rate. Table 1b studies the EMA estimator, where the decay rate β
implicitly controls the effective population size. The estimator is robust across a wide range (β=0.9
to 0.9999). The best setting, β=0.999, achieves 0.81 FID and 10.81 FDr6, improving the best queue
result while requiring negligible extra memory. We use β=0.999 in all subsequent experiments.
Both studies confirm that FD-loss needs a population larger than the optimization batch, but not so
large that staleness dominates. We default to EMA for its simplicity and stronger results.
4.2
Properties of Representation Models in FD-loss
Single representation model. Table 1c studies FD-loss under different representations; Figure 4
shows qualitative comparisons. As expected, each model scores best in the representation space it

optimizes (on-diagonal). However, the off-diagonal behavior differs across model families. Opti-
mizing Inception [47] gives the best FID (3.31→0.81) and improves FDr6 slightly (13.70→10.81).
Optimizing modern ViTs, e.g., DINOv2, MAE, SigLIP2, worsens FID but improves FDr6 more
substantially. ConvNeXt [27], a modern CNN, sits in between: it improves FID less than Inception
(3.31→1.64) but FDr6 more (13.70→8.46). This reveals that CNN-based representations tend to
improve FID, while ViT-based ones improve the broader FDr6 more.
These results already indicate that lower FID and better overall quality are not always the same
objective. Improvements captured by modern feature spaces can be invisible, or even unfavorable,
under Inception. Moreover, under Inception [47] and ConvNeXt [27], FD-loss can even drive FDr
below 1.0; in other words, the generated images become statistically closer to the training set than
real validation images, suggesting that some feature spaces are easier to saturate than others.
Figure 4 further supports this. Post-trained models improve visually over the base model. Yet, the
lowest-FID model (Inception, 0.81) does not produce the best samples; instead, models post-trained
with modern representations show better object structure despite much higher FID.
Multiple representation models. Table 1c further studies combinations of representations (Eq. 6).
Combining representations is generally more effective than using a single one. Optimizing SigLIP
with Inception recovers FID to 0.89 while maintaining strong FDr6. Adding MAE (denoted FD-SIM)
further improves FDr6 with a negligible FID trade-off. We use FD-SIM as the default from now on.
4.3
Repurposing Multi-Step Generators into One-Step Generators
We study whether FD-loss can repurpose a pre-trained multi-step model into a one-step generator.
We use JiT-L/16 [23] as the base model and post-train it for 50 epochs following Section 3.3. Table 2
and Figure 5 report the results. As expected, the base model fails in the naive one-step setting,
since it is trained for multi-step denoising. After post-training with FD-loss, all variants produce
sensible images. FD-SIM achieves the best FDr6 (3.29) with FID 0.85, while FD-Inception gives
the best FID (0.77) but a much higher FDr6 (12.86). Notably, repurposing is more demanding than
improving an already strong one-step model: capable representations such as MAE, SigLIP2, and
their combinations all yield visually compelling samples, whereas Inception alone might not be strong

FD-loss recipe works both for improving one-step generators and for converting multi-step ones into
one-step, with no distillation, adversarial loss, or per-sample regression target.

Comparisons
Scalability. Table 3 reports FD-loss post-trained models on three generator families (pMF [30],
iMF [12], JiT [23]), each at three model sizes, on ImageNet 256×256, and on pMF at three sizes
on ImageNet 512×512. Across all configurations, FD-SIM drives FDr6 to between 1.81 and 5.56,
and FD-Inception drives FID to between 0.72 and 0.79. These gains are obtained with the same
hyperparameters. Per-model tuning could yield better results. FD-loss thus transfers across pixel and
latent spaces, one-step and repurposed multi-step generators, model scales, and image resolutions.
System-level comparison. As a reference, we compare FD-loss post-trained models with prior
work in Table 4. Since FDr6 has not been reported before, we re-sample 50k images from official

post-trained models push FID below all prior systems and drive FDr6 substantially lower. More
importantly, they achieve this with only a single network function evaluation (1 NFE).
Human preference. Since automatic metrics are only proxies for perceptual quality, we further
conduct a pairwise human preference study (Fig. 6; Appendix C). The study provides two signals.
First, FD-loss post-trained models are preferred over their corresponding base models across all three
generator families. Second, even the strongest generator tested in this study is still preferred less often
than real validation images, corroborating that ImageNet generation is not yet solved (Fig. 3).

Text-Conditioned Generation
Beyond class-conditioned generation models on ImageNet, we repurpose SD3.5 Medium [9], a
2.5B-parameter MMDiT originally trained for multi-step latent-space denoising, into a 1-NFE
text-to-image generator with FD-loss (Fig. 7). This demonstrates that FD-loss can extend beyond
class-conditioned settings and scale to large text-conditioned models. A full comparison including a
BLIP3o-Pretrain-Long-3M variant is in Figure G.1; training details are in Appendix B.4.

Ours: FD-loss, BLIP3o-GPT4o-60k (1 NFE)

FD-loss using BLIP3o-GPT4o-60k [3], a curated 60k dataset distilled from GPT-4o with a stylized
aesthetic as the reference image distribution. Despite 56× NFE reduction, the post-trained 1-NFE
model can preserve recognizable prompt content while inheriting the stylized look of the reference
distribution. More in Appendix G.

Conclusion
Generation is, at its core, a distributional problem. Over the years, however, the training of generative
models has focused primarily on sample-level losses, e.g., diffusion, flow matching, and adversarial
objectives, while distributional distances, such as Fréchet Distance, have lived only as evaluators. This
separation has been a matter of practicality rather than principle: FD has always been differentiable,
yet reliable estimation requires populations far beyond a training batch. Under these perspectives, our
findings with FD-loss are, in hindsight, a natural outcome: once population size and gradient size are
decoupled, a distributional distance can serve directly as a training loss.
We hope our work will make distribution-level post-training broadly applicable: to other modalities,
to settings where access to real data during post-training is scarce or restricted, and to paradigms
beyond image generation. More generally, once a distributional distance becomes optimizable at
scale, a central design question shifts from how to optimize the distance to which representation
space should define it. Our work makes initial attempts by exploring several existing representations.
Different representations induce different notions of visual similarity, and no single feature space
should be expected to fully capture perceptual quality. We hope this perspective will encourage future
work on distribution-level objectives and representation-diverse evaluation for generative models.

A
Additional Design Attempts and Observations
We summarize several exploratory attempts and observations that shaped the final design of FD-loss.
These should not be read as negative results of our method, but rather as illustrations of what happens
when a representation or objective is made too narrow. We hope these “negative signals” can serve as
useful “inverse gradients” for future research.
Representation-coupled reward hacking. All automatic objectives are proxies for the properties
we ultimately care about. When the proxy is optimized directly, it can become misaligned with the
underlying goal, a phenomenon often discussed through Goodhart’s law [14]. A closely related issue
appears in reward-model optimization for large language models: reinforcement learning from human
feedback methods learn a reward model from human preferences [4], but over-optimizing that learned
reward can reduce true preference quality [10]. Technically, FD-loss is not an RL algorithm, but it
faces an analogous proxy-optimization issue: reducing FD in a chosen feature space can be viewed
as optimizing a distribution-level reward supplied by that representation model.
This proxy is useful, but it is incomplete. For example, optimizing Inception FD reliably improves
the base generator and can bring pMF-B/16 to 0.81 FID; the resulting model is visually better than
the base model. However, it is not necessarily perceptually stronger than some other generators
whose FID is around 1.0–1.5. In this regime, continuing to optimize the same narrow representation
further improves the chosen score without addressing the representation’s blind spots. This is exactly
the distinction exposed by FDr6: Inception-only optimization greatly improves FID, while modern
representation spaces reveal remaining quality gaps.
How much you can game FID and IS. The same point can be made more visibly by deliberately
over-optimizing Inception-based metrics. In early experiments, we found that Inception Score (IS)
can also be optimized with a queue-style estimator. As a focused stress test, we post-train pMF-B
with a learning rate 10−4, which is 100× larger than our default learning rate for pMF. Figure A.1
shows the resulting samples: the model attains 660 IS and 2.09 FID, yet its FDr6 rises to 50.66,
and the images exhibit clear artifacts and unnatural colors. We include these results only to show
that Inception-based automatic metrics can be pushed to extremes, but on their own are not reliable
objectives for visual quality. We omitted an extended discussion of IS optimization from the main
paper for clarity. During early experimentation, we repeatedly observed similar variants that achieved
exceptional FID and IS despite poor visual quality (e.g., FID between 0.9 and 2.1 with IS between
500 and 900), which ultimately motivated us to explore representation-diverse evaluation metrics.
The representation problem remains open. Even with multiple modern representation models, we
believe some imperfections in generated images are still not captured by any representation model we
tested. In this work, FDr6 uses six feature spaces spanning supervised, self-supervised, reconstructive,
and vision-language objectives. This set is substantially more diverse than FID alone, and it reveals
many gaps that Inception misses. Still, six representations are unlikely to exhaust perceptual quality.
Every representation discards some information, and every automatic metric inherits the blind spots of
14

Figure A.1: A stress test of over-optimizing Inception-based metrics. We deliberately opti-
mize Inception-based scores with a 100× larger learning rate. The resulting model attains 660 IS
and 2.09 FID, but its samples exhibit clear artifacts and its FDr6 degrades to 50.66. This illus-
trates that Inception-based metrics can be pushed without improving perceptual quality, motivating
representation-diverse evaluation and human preference checks.
its feature space. In this sense, finding representations that capture perceptual quality is an open-ended
problem rather than a finite checklist.
We view FDrk as a practical step toward reducing single-model bias, not as a final solution. This is
also why we conduct a human preference study. When one-step post-trained models score better than
strong multi-step systems such as RAE under FDr6, we need to check whether they genuinely look
better to humans, or whether we have merely found a broader but still hackable automatic metric.

B.4
Text-to-Image Post-Training
We take the MMDiT transformer from Stable Diffusion 3.5 Medium [9] (2.5B parameters) and post-
train it with FD-loss for one-step generation at 256×256 resolution. The SD3.5 VAE tokenizer is
used unchanged. We use the SIM representation set (SigLIP2+Inception+MAE). Reference statistics
(µr, Σr) are pre-computed from all real images in each set (3M for variant (i), 60k for variant (ii)).
EMA feature statistics are warm-started with 50k images generated from the base model before
training begins.
Training uses a cosine learning rate schedule with peak lr=10−5 and 2,500 warmup steps, for 15,000
total steps. The global batch size is 1024; each step generates one image per caption with one
16

denoising step (no classifier-free guidance, CFG=1). EMA statistics are tracked with β=0.999 and
the eigenvalue-based matrix square root (eigvalsh) is used.
We train two variants that differ only in the caption and image sources: (i) BLIP3o-Pretrain-Long-
3M [3], a 3M subset randomly sampled from the original 30M caption-image web dataset, paired with
realistic photographic images; and (ii) BLIP3o-GPT4o-60k [3], a 60k curated set whose images are
distilled from GPT-4o and exhibit a stylized, illustration-leaning aesthetic. All other hyperparameters
are identical between the two runs.

Evaluation Protocol
For all methods, we sample 50,000 images from the official checkpoints using the official code,
primarily relying on coding agents such as Claude Code [1] and Codex [37] to follow the instructions
provided in each codebase. We then manually check if the sampled images are correct and run the
evaluation on the sampled images ourselves. Class-conditional models sample uniformly across all
1,000 classes (50 images per class). Reference statistics (µr, Σr) are computed once from the full
ImageNet training set.
C
Human Preference Study
We conduct a pairwise human preference study using anonymized 3×3 image grids. For each trial,
voters choose the grid with higher visual fidelity, with an additional tie option. The left–right order is
randomized independently for every trial, and model identities are hidden. We evaluate two settings:
(i) Post-trained vs. Base, where each FD-loss post-trained model is compared with its corresponding
base model using matched initial noise, so the two grids are directly comparable; and (ii) Generator
vs. Real, where a generator is compared against ImageNet validation images.
We collect 2,929 valid votes from 17 participants after filtering incomplete or invalid responses. For
reporting, ties are split evenly between the two sides: if W, T, and L denote win, tie, and loss rates
for FD-loss, its preference score is W + T/2. Figure 6 reports aggregated preference scores.
17

Figure C.1: Screenshot of the voting page. Voters see two anonymized 3×3 grids of samples for the
same ImageNet class and pick Left, Tie, or Right for fidelity.
Interface. The voting interface is shown in Figure C.1. Each trial shows two side-by-side grids of
uncurated samples from the same ImageNet class, sampled uniformly from the 1000 classes. The
voter selects Left, Tie, or Right. A Skip arrow advances to a new pair without recording a vote, and a
Back arrow revisits the immediately preceding pair. Images can be clicked for closer inspection.
Sampling. For each model, we sample 50,000 images in total, with 50 images per class. For
each class, images are grouped into 3×3 grids; when the number of images is insufficient for
an integer number of grids, we sample with replacement. All generators are sampled using their
best-FID inference settings. Post-trained vs. Base trials are sampled uniformly among the three
base/post-trained pairs, and Generator vs. Real trials are sampled uniformly among the three
generator/validation pairs.
D
Limitations and Broader Impact
Limitations. Our study focuses on image generation, with ImageNet serving as the primary con-
trolled benchmark and text-conditioned generation providing an additional demonstration. As with
any distribution-level objective or automatic metric, the behavior of FD-loss depends on the choice
of representation spaces and reference statistics; different domains may benefit from different fea-
ture sets or weighting schemes. FD-loss is designed as a post-training objective that complements
existing generator training recipes and evaluation protocols. Future work can explore broader data
distributions, additional modalities, higher-resolution settings, and adaptive or learned representation
sets for distribution-level optimization.
18

Broader impact. Our work improves the quality of image generators, which carries dual-use risks
common to all generative modeling research. Higher-quality generators could be misused to generate
disinformation or deceptive content. We believe that the diagnostic value of our work, showing that
FID alone is an insufficient quality measure, contributes positively to the field’s ability to evaluate
and understand generative models. We do not release any new datasets; all experiments use publicly
available models and data.
E
Additional Qualitative Samples
We provide uncurated paired samples for two generators from Table 4. First, we show the one-step
pMF-H/16 base model alongside its post-trained counterpart using FD-loss (SIM). Second, we show
JiT-H/16 with 200 NFE (50 steps × 2 (Heun) × 2 (CFG)) alongside its FD-loss post-trained version
using only 1 NFE. Each pair uses the same initial noise for direct comparison. All samples are
uncurated.

Figure G.1: Full text-to-image qualitative comparison (reproduction of Figure 7). We post-train
SD3.5 Medium [9] with FD-loss on two reference image distributions: BLIP3o-Pretrain-Long-3M [3],
a 3M subset of a web corpus of realistic photographs, and BLIP3o-GPT4o-60k [3], a curated 60k
dataset distilled from GPT-4o with a stylized aesthetic. These qualitative examples suggest that the
post-trained 1-NFE models can preserve recognizable prompt content despite a 56× NFE reduction.
The reference image distribution also appears to shape the post-trained aesthetic: the 3M variant
tends toward photorealism, while the 60k variant tends toward the stylized look. Each column shares
the same prompt; full prompts in Appendix G.

facade. The building is painted in a light yellow hue with white decorative elements. Each
window has red awnings and is adorned with potted plants.
#5 A quaint, historic building with a weathered, light beige facade. The structure features multiple
windows with wooden frames and balconies adorned with plants. A stone archway leads into
the building. The street in front is paved with cobblestones.
#6 A vibrant garden scene dominated by lush green foliage and striking red flowers. The flowers
appear to be some variety of red-hot poker (Kniphofia), standing out vividly against the backdrop
of glossy, dark green leaves.
#7 A cozy, rustic restaurant with a warm and inviting atmosphere. The interior features wooden
beams on the ceiling and polished wood flooring, giving a cabin-like feel.
#8 A fishing boat navigating through choppy waters under a clear blue sky with scattered clouds.
The boat is white with blue accents and features a small cabin, a deck area with railings, and
various fishing equipment visible on top.
#9 The exterior of a traditional-style building with a white facade and red shutters on the windows.
Two flags, one on each side of the entrance, add a cultural touch. The entrance reveals an interior
with wooden furniture and framed pictures.
