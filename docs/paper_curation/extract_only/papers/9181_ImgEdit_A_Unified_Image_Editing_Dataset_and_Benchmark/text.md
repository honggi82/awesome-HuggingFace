## Abstract

Recent advancements in generative models have enabled high-fidelity text-to-image generation. However, open-source image-editing models still lag behind their proprietary counterparts, primarily due to limited high-quality data and insufficient benchmarks. To overcome these limitations, we introduce ImgEdit, a largescale, high-quality image-editing dataset comprising 1.2 million carefully curated edit pairs, which contain both novel and complex single-turn edits, as well as challenging multi-turn tasks. To ensure the data quality, we employ a multi-stage pipeline that integrates a cutting-edge vision-language model, a detection model, a segmentation model, alongside task-specific in-painting procedures and strict postprocessing. ImgEdit surpasses existing datasets in both task novelty and data quality. Using ImgEdit, we train ImgEdit-E1, an editing model using Vision Language Model to process the reference image and editing prompt, which outperforms existing open-source models on multiple tasks, highlighting the value of ImgEdit and model design. For comprehensive evaluation, we introduce ImgEdit-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate image editing performance in terms of instruction adherence, editing quality, and detail preservation. It includes a basic testsuite, a challenging single-turn suite, and a dedicated multi-turn suite. We evaluate both open-source and proprietary models, as well as ImgEdit-E1, providing deep analysis and actionable insights into the current behavior of image-editing models.1

## 1 Introduction

Recent progress in large-scale multi-modal datasets [43, 58, 45, 32, 63, 2] has enabled text-to-image models [56, 12, 13, 53, 14, 64, 22] to produce images with unprecedented fidelity. Among downstream applications, image editing [79, 73, 25, 27, 49, 60] stands out as especially important: users aim to apply precise local or global modifications to images, altering target regions while preserving the rest. The latest cutting-edge models, such as GPT-4o-Image [51] and Gemini-2.0-Flash [19] have recently achieved notable improvements in editing accuracy and instruction following ability. Additionally, these models have demonstrated a strong ability to perform complex, multi-turn edits, advancing image editing toward becoming a practical and powerful tool for real-world applications [76, 77, 37].

However, the performance gap between closed-source and open-source models continues to widen, primarily due to the lack of high-quality, publicly available editing datasets and accurate evaluation benchmarks in the open-source community. As shown in Table 1 and Table 2, the existing datasets [79, 83, 86, 59, 18, 28, 3, 80, 28] and benchmarks [83, 59, 70, 48] exhibit three main limitations: (1) Sub-optimal data quality and prompt design: Current collection pipelines typically begin with low-resolution images [43, 45, 31], generate prompts with open-source large language models [21, 66, 45, 42] that may introduce knowledge biases, synthesize edited image pairs using low-fidelity

algorithms [56, 6], and apply coarse post-processing filters based on semantic scores [54, 7, 52] that measure editing quality poorly. Consequently, most datasets suffer from poor image resolution, simplistic prompts, negligible edit regions, inaccurate editing, concept imbalance, and imprecise filtering. (2) Inadequate support for complex editing tasks: Existing datasets rarely include edit types that (i) preserve identity consistency [51, 81], (ii) manipulate multiple objects simultaneously, or (iii) span multi-turn interactions [51, 19, 47]. Identity-preserving capability is critical for applications such as virtual try-on [74, 82] and product design, whereas the latter two are indispensable in real-world scenarios and important for user experience. Although MagicBrush [83] and SEED-DataEdit [18] contain multi-turn examples, they neglect the semantic relevance between prompts across different turns, which leads to failures in meeting the requirements for content understanding, content memory, or version backtracking. (3) Limited benchmarking protocols: The existing evaluation frameworks [70, 48, 30, 5] lack of diverse or reasonable evaluation dimensions. They do not stratify task difficulty, overemphasize the number of editing categories, and pay insufficient attention to evaluation dimensions or measurement accuracy. These limitations prevent current benchmarks from reliably characterizing the specific strengths and weaknesses of models [51, 19, 46, 79, 86, 83].

To address these challenges, we present ImgEdit, a unified framework that combines (1) an automated data construction pipeline, (2) a large-scale editing dataset, (3) an advanced editing model, and (4) a comprehensive benchmark for evaluation. As illustrated in Figure 2(left), we develop an automated pipeline to guarantee data quality. First, we discard images with low aesthetic scores [58], insufficient resolution, or negligible editable regions. Next, we generate object-level grounding annotations for the remaining images using an open vocabulary detector [8] and a visual segmentation model [57]. We then feed GPT-4o [1] with grounding information, target object, and specified edit type to generate a diverse set of single-turn and multi-turn prompts. Subsequently, task-specific workflows powered by state-of-the-art models [84, 13, 53] create the edited pairs. Finally, GPT-4o evaluates whether the edit pairs follow the edit prompt while preserving visual fidelity. The resulting dataset consists of 1.1 million high-quality single-turn edit pairs covering 10 editing operations, demonstrated in Figure 1 and Figure 3. These include a subset of object extraction tasks, wherein identity-consistent objects are isolated from complex scenes, as well as hybrid edit tasks involving instructions that reference multiple objects and editing operations. Additionally, the dataset contains 110,000 multi-turn interaction samples designed to include content understanding, content memory, and version backtracking edit tasks. To verifying the effectiveness of the proposed dataset, we train ImgEdit-E1 with ImgEdit, achieving new state-of-the-art performance across multiple image editing tasks. Finally, we propose ImgEdit-Bench, consisting of three key components: a basic editing suite that evaluates instruction adherence, editing quality, and detail preservation across a diverse range of tasks; an Understanding-Grounding-Editing (UGE) suite, which increases task complexity through challenging instructions (e.g., spatial reasoning and multi-object targets) and complex scenes such as multi-instance layouts or camouflaged objects; and a multi-turn editing suite, designed to assess content understanding, content memory, and version backtracking. To facilitate large-scale evaluation, we train ImgEdit-Judge, an evaluation model whose preferences closely align with human judgments. Our main contributions are summarized as follows:

- i) Robust Pipeline. We introduce a high-quality data generation pipeline ensures that the dataset is diverse, representative, and of sufficient quality to support the development of image editing models.

- ii) New Dataset. We construct ImgEdit, a large-scale, high-quality dataset comprising 1.1 million single-turn samples with ten representative edit tasks and 110,000 multi-turn samples containing three novel interaction types.
- iii) Reliable Benchmark. We release ImgEdit-Bench, which evaluates models across tasks in three key dimensions, including a basic, challenging, and multi-turn suite.
- iv) Advanced Models. We train ImgEdit-E1 on ImgEdit, surpassing open-source models on many tasks. Moreover, We release ImgEdit-Judge, an evaluation model aligned with human preferences.

## 2 Related Work

### 2.1 Datasets for Image Editing

- Table 1 compares representative instruction-driven image-editing datasets [6, 28, 83, 18, 86, 79]. InstructPix2Pix [6], EMU-Edit [59], HQ-Edit [28], and AnyEdit [79] rely almost entirely on synthetic or fully automated pipelines, whereas SEED-DataEdit [18], UltraEdit [86], MagicBrush [83] add varying degrees of human quality control. InstructPix2Pix is confined to the P2P [24] synthetic domain, hindering real-image transfer. MagicBrush improves real-world usability through highquality human annotations but contains only 10,000 pairs. HQ-Edit enriches captions with GPT-4V [1] and DALL-E [61] yet produces images that limit realism. Recent datasets [79, 18] expand the range of edit types and dialog turns, but they are still confronted with limited data quality and insufficient prompt diversity. SEED-DataEdit introduces multi-turn interaction data [17, 44, 11, 9]; however, there is no interaction between each turn, rarely reflecting real-world workflows. Additionally, compositional operations in single-prompt and identity consistency edit remain under-represented.

### 2.2 Benchmarks for Image Editing

Current benchmark [30, 48, 70, 83, 27, 59, 85, 28, 79, 35, 36] for instruction-driven image-editing models [38, 20, 16, 69, 34, 15, 71] remain rudimentary. Earlier studies typically rely on generic similarity metrics—such as the CLIP score [54], PSNR [33], SSIM [72], —that correlate poorly with human judgments. MagicBrush [83] and EMU-Edit [59] broaden the scope of task-specific benchmarks, yet they still measure performance by similarity. SmartEdit [27] targets highly complex scenes but neglects most common settings. I2E-Bench [48] employs GPT-4o to produce humanaligned evaluations across diverse tasks; however, it employs a distinct metric for each task, which does not adequately capture the shared characteristics of editing. Moreover, none of the benchmarks differentiate between difficulty levels [10], which may result in unfair evaluations of the models. Although recent multimodal systems like GPT-4o-image [51] and Gemini-2.0-Flash [19] highlight the need for multi-turn editing, no existing benchmark currently addresses this, to our knowledge.

## 3 ImgEdit: A High Quality Dataset

ImgEdit provides high-fidelity edit pairs with accurate, comprehensive instructions, and encompasses a broader range of both practical and challenging edit types. Section 3.1 outlines the single- and multiturn editing types, Section 3.2 details the data pipeline. We introduce ImgEdit-E1 in Section 3.3, which is a cutting-edge edit model trained on ImgEdit. Section 3.4 presents the dataset statistics.

### 3.1 Edit Type Definition

We define two categories of editing tasks: single-turn and multi-turn. Single-turn tasks focus on covering comprehensive and practical tasks, whereas multi-turn tasks integrate interactions across instructions and images in continuous editing scenarios.

Single-Turn Edit Based on real-world editing practice, we divide single-turn tasks into four categories: local, global, visual, and hybrid edit, shown in Figure 1. Local Edit includes add, remove, replace, alter, motion change, and object extraction operations. Changes in color, material, or appearance are subsumed under alteration. Because editing human actions is a common use case [67], we also support motion changes specific to human subjects. Moreover, we introduce a novel object extraction task, for example—“extract the cat to a white background”—that isolates a specified subject on clean background while preserving identity consistency. This capability is valuable in many design pipelines [74] and is currently available only in GPT-4o-image [51]. Global Edit comprises background replacement and style or tone transfer. Visual Edit involves editing an image using a reference image. Given a reference object and an instruction, such as “add a scarf to the cat”, the edit task performs the edit while ensuring object consistency. Unlike AnyEdit [79],

we omit segment-, sketch-, and layout-guided variants since such visual cues are seldom supplied in practice. Hybrid Edit contains two local edit operations applied to several objects within a single instruction. They are created by randomly combining add, remove, replace, and alter operations—for example, “add a scarf and change the cat’s fur colour to white”.

Multi-Turn Edit Getting insights from existing multi-turn understanding benchmarks [62, 23, 87] and practical requirements, we identify three major challenges in multi-turn image editing, which are content memory, content understanding, and version backtracking, illustrated in Figure 1. Content Memory concerns global constraints introduced early in the dialogue. If the initial instruction stipulates that “all generation must have a wooden texture”, subsequent turns do not need to restate this requirement; however, the constraint must still be honored. Content Understanding refers to the ability to interpret later instructions that rely on pronouns or omitted subjects. For example, after the first instructs, “Place a piece of clothing in the wardrobe on the left side of the image”, second turn may request, “Make it black”, and third turn, “Change into white”, both implicitly referring to the clothing added in first turn. Version Backtracking denotes the capability to edit based on earlier versions of edit results. For example, “Undo the previous change(or starting from the original input) ...” We believe that these three challenges cover most of the difficulties and distinguishing features of multi-turn interactive editing, which frequently arise in practical applications.

### 3.2 Automatic Dataset Pipline

Data Preparation We adopt LAION-Aesthetics [58] as our primary corpus. Compared to other datasets [43, 45], it offers greater diversity in scenes, higher resolution, and a more comprehensive range of object classes. We retain only images whose shorter side exceeds 1280 pixels and whose aesthetic score [58] is above 4.75, resulting in a 600k image subset. GPT-4o [1] is then used to regenerate concise captions and to extract editable objects and background nouns. Next, each candidate entity is localised with an open-vocabulary detector [8], and the resulting bounding boxes are refined into segmentation masks with SAM2 [57]. Every object and background region thus obtains both a bounding box and a mask. Because detection and segmentation are imperfect, we crop each object by its mask and compute (i) CLIPScore [54] between the crop and its object name, (ii) area ratio. Regions with low similarity or negligible area are discarded, ensuring that the remaining targets are accurately identified and visually salient for subsequent editing. Specifically, we ensure that the edited area constitutes more than 40% of the image for the background-changing task. For motion change Edit, we additionally collect 160k image pairs from Open-Sora Plan [39] in-house videos that depict only people. Frames are temporally subsampled and their motions are annotated by GPT-4o [51], yielding the motion change subset.

- Figure 2: The Data Pipeline and Model Architecture. (Left) Our pipeline includes pre-filter, grounding and segmentation, caption generation, in-painting and post-processing, leveraging lots of state-of-the-arts models. (Right) ImgEdit-E1 includes a Qwen2.5-VL-7B [4] as text and image encoder, a SigLIP [68] provides low-level feature, and FLUX [13] as DiT backbone.

Instruction Generation We provide the original image caption, edit type, bounding box, and target object as conditioning information for prompt generation. Because precise localization of the target object is essential for successful editing, we instruct the language model to embed the position of object and approximate size in the editing instruction, using the bounding box as a reference. Less capable LLMs [66, 21] can introduce knowledge bias and produce low-quality prompts [79, 86]; therefore, we employ the state-of-the-art large language model [1], which not only understands diverse instruction formats and generates concept-rich editing instructions but also encodes spatial cues with high fidelity. For multi-turn prompt generation, we supply a few in-context examples and ask the model to produce the entire dialogue in a single pass; we then split the output into individual turns. To balance task complexity and operability, each dialogue is limited to two or three turns and is constructed from four basic operations: add, remove, replace, and alter.

In-painting Workflow We select state-of-the-art generative models, such as FLUX [13] and SDXL [53], as base models. To achieve precise and controllable editing, we employ plug-ins, e.g., IP-Adapters [78], ControlNet [84], and Canny/Depth LoRA [26]. Based on these models and components, we construct data manufacturing pipelines tailored to each editing scenario. Within these pipelines, we incorporate novel techniques from the community to generate high-quality data. For instance, in visual edit tasks, we leverage the in-context capabilities of the FLUX architecture to maintain consistency and use FLUX-Redux to control semantics. Images produced by our method consistently outperform those in existing datasets [79, 86, 83, 18], exhibiting higher aesthetic quality and greater edit fidelity, as quantified in Section 3.4. In multi-turn dialogues, we reuse the same workflow, treating each request as an independent editing task.

Post-Processing Since we have already performed a coarse filter during data preparation based on object area, CLIP score, and aesthetic score, we employ GPT-4o [1] to apply a precise filter in the post-processing stage. For each edit pair, GPT-4o assigns a quality score based on a prompt-guided rubric specific to the corresponding edit type. We provide detailed scores and brief reasons from gpt for each pair to enable users to select a subset based on their needs.

### 3.3 ImgEdit-E1

To evaluate the quality of the collected data, we train ImgEdit-E1 on ImgEdit. ImgEdit-E1 integrates a vision-language model (VLM) [4], a vision encoder [68], and a Diffusion-in-Transformer(DiT) backbone [13], as illustrated in Figure 2. The edit instruction and the original image are jointly fed into VLM, while the image is processed simultaneously by the vision encoder. The hidden states of VLM and the visual feature of the vision encoder are separately projected by MLPs and then concatenated, forming the text-branch input to DiT. Training proceeds in two stages [41], first optimizing MLPs and then jointly fine-tuning FLUX and MLPs.

### 3.4 Dataset Statistics

ImgEdit comprises 1.2 million high-quality image-editing pairs spanning 13 editing categories, including 110k multi-turn examples. Compared with existing datasets [79, 18, 86, 83, 28, 6], ImgEdit offers richer semantics, more detailed prompts, higher resolutions, greater editing accuracy, and overall superior visual fidelity. In particular, the object extraction and visual edit subsets constitute the first editing tasks with high subject consistency.

The average short-side resolution of ImgEdit is 1280 pixels, whereas most competing corpora fall below this threshold. In terms of prompt diversity, ImgEdit contains 8.7k unique words. To assess editing accuracy, we randomly sampled 1,000 instances from each dataset and evaluated them with GPT-4o [51], ImgEdit achieves the highest score. We further quantified the edited area for local edits tasks by pixel-wise differencing between the source and edited images; compared with other corpora, ImgEdit includes far fewer examples with small modification regions. Moreover, when a state-of-the-art editing-region detector [75] is applied, edits in ImgEdit are substantially harder to locate, indicating higher image quality. Comprehensive statistics are provided in

- Section 4.1 outlines the composition of the benchmark dataset, Section 4.2 defines the evaluation metrics, and Section 4.3 introduces ImgEdit-Judge, a model to evaluate image editing tasks.

### 4.1 Benchmark Construction

We divide the capabilities of model into two categories: basic proficiency and performance in complex scenarios. The basic edit suite measures the ability to complete easy tasks. The UnderstandingGrounding-Editing (UGE) test suite assesses model capacity to perform understanding, grounding, and editing simultaneously within a single prompt. Finally, the multi-turn evaluation evaluate ability in content understanding, content memory, and version backtracking.

Basic-Edit Suite Our benchmark comprises nine common image-editing tasks—add, remove, alter, replace, style transfer, background change, motion change, hybrid edit, and cut-out—evaluated on images that were manually collected from the Internet. To ensure semantic diversity, we select ten representative concepts from each of six super-categories (human, transportation, nature, animals, architecture, and necessities). For the add task, we pair each of ten relatively uncluttered background images with five prompts per concept. For the remove, alter, replace, cut-out, and hybrid-edit tasks, we chose photographs that contain few objects and a visually salient main subject. Style transfer is tested on popular styles; background change uses scenes suitable for substitution; motion change is assessed on human-centric images. All instructions are initially generated by GPT-4o [1] and then manually filtered. The resulting benchmark comprises 734 test cases with prompt lengths ranging from short to elaborate.

Understanding-Grounding-Editing Suite We manually curated 47 complex images from the Internet that pose diverse challenges—partially occluded targets, scenes with multiple instances of the same category, camouflaged or visually inconspicuous objects, and uncommon editing subjects. For each image, we devised editing prompts that require spatial reasoning, multi-object coordination, compound or fine-grained operations, and large-scale modifications, thereby elevating the difficulty of comprehension, localization, and manipulation within a single prompt.

Multi-Turn Suite For the multi-turn evaluation, we evaluate real-world use cases across three dimensions—content memory, content understanding, and version backtracking. Since it is very easy to judge whether the model have the ability to do multi-turn editing, we do not use many examples. We select 10 images for each tasks and manually designed prompts, resulting in 3 interaction turns for each case.

### 4.2 Evaluation Metrics

We evaluated model performance along three dimensions: instruction adherence, image-editing quality, and detail preservation. Instruction adherence captures both prompt comprehension and conceptual understanding of the corresponding prompts. Because instruction adherence is fundamental to the editing task and cannot be fully separated from the other two aspects, the scores for image-editing

- Table 2: Key Attributes of Open-source Edit Benchmarks. The reliance of existing benchmarks on difficulty-level, multi-turn support, and evaluation metrics highlight the necessity of ImgEdit-Bench.

quality and detail preservation are capped at the instruction-adherence score. Image-editing quality measures how precisely the target region is manipulated, whereas detail preservation measures the fidelity of regions that should remain unchanged. We employ the state-of-the-art Vision Language Model GPT-4o [1] to assign 1-5 ratings. For each task, we provide detailed scoring rubrics based on the three dimensions. In the multi-turn setting, human evaluators provided yes-or-no ratings for model output, following comprehensive guidelines designed to assess multi-turn capability. Additionally, we introduce a fake score to quantify how fake a generated image appears. To compute this, we use FakeShield [75], the latest open-source forensic detector that localizes editing artifacts within images. Specifically, we evaluate the recall (treating fake as the positive class) on various image-editing datasets and compare the results against ours. This allows us to assess and validate the visual realism and editing quality of our generated images.

Because scores produced by vision–language models (VLMs) are more reasonable than traditional similarity metrics [54, 7], and no opensource VLM evaluator for image editing currently exists, we constructed a task-balanced and score-balanced corpus of 200k post-processed rating records and used it to fine-tune Qwen2.5VL-7B [4]. We then performed a human study in which each image was rated by both human annotators, Qwen2.5VL-7B, ImgEdit-Judge, and GPT-4o-mini, and selected 60 images for detailed analysis. A judgment made by the model is considered correct when its score differs from the corresponding human score by no more than one point. As illustrated in Figure 4, ImgEdit-Judge matches human judgments more closely than GPT-4o-mini and Qwen2.5-VL-7B, reaching almost 70% agreement and surpassing the original Qwen2.5-VL by a substantial margin.

- Section 5.1 delineates the models under examination and experimental setup, Section 5.2 offers a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the results, and Section 5.3 presents further discussion.

### 5.1 Evaluation Setups

We run our single-turn benchmark on a wide range of image-editing models: the close-source model includes GPT-4o-Image [51] (since Gemini-2.0-Flash [19] do not permit API request), while the opensource models include Step1X-Edit [46], Ultra-Edit [86], AnySD [79], MagicBrush [83], InstructPix2Pix [6], and ImgEdit-E1. Except for ImgEdit-E1 and Step1X-Edit, which use a Vision-Language Model as the text encoder and a Diffusion Transformer as the backbone, all other open-source models rely on traditional UNet structures for diffusion models and pretrained text encoders [55, 54]. AnySD additionally incorporates a task-aware MoE block [40, 29].

All models are evaluated with identical prompts and images, and editing and evaluation are performed at the native resolution of each model. UltraEdit [86] and AnySD [79] generate outputs at 512 × 512 pixels, whereas the remaining models generate outputs at 1024 × 1024 pixels. Each experiment is

repeated three times per model, and the mean score across the three runs is reported as the final result. We evaluate the multi-turn ability for the only two models that support multi-turn editing: GPT-4o-Image and Gemini-2.0-Flash.

Quantitative Evaluation We present a comprehensive qual evaluation of different methods, results displayed in Figure 5. source models and closed-source model exhibit a significant p mance gap, with GPT-4o-image outperforming open-source m across all dimensions, only s lagging in some challenging GPT-4o-Image also has highest scores, indicating stronger understanding, localization, and editing ca ities. Among the open-source els, ImgEdit-E1 and Step1X-Edit form the best, achieving results to closed-source model on a few ImgEdit-E1 demonstrates good formance across all tasks, particularly surpasses other open-sourced models in object extraction and hybrid edit tasks due to its inclusion of high-quality data. Step1X-Edit exhibits similar performance to ImgEdit-E1 but falls short in background change, attribute alteration, and hard tasks. AnySD shows relatively average performance across various tasks but does not achieve outstanding results, possibly due to the broad range of editing tasks in its dataset, but lacks high-quality data. UltraEdit performs poorly in the removal task as it does not include this task in its dataset. MagicBrush and InstructPix2Pix suffer from issues such as image distortion and failure to follow instructions due to the quality and diversity of their training data and overly simple model structure. For all models, the editing outputs receive extremely high fake scores, indicating that detection models can still easily identify them. The scores of all models are provided in the appendix.

Figure 5: Scores of Sub-Tasks for Each Model.

For multi-turn tasks, GPT-4o-Image and Gemini-2.0-flash exhibits version backtracking capabilities within two turns. Models both possess minimal content memory and content understanding capabilities which may occasionally experience misunderstandings of some references or difficulty retaining premises in certain cases. Overall, these models provide inadequate support for multi-turn edits. More results are discussed in the appendix.

Qualitative Evaluation We select representative examples of diverse tasks for qualitative analysis, as shown in Figure 6. Only ImgEdit-E1 and GPT-4o-Image successfully preserves the snow on the bike while changing its color. In tasks involving object removal, AnySD and Step1X-Edit produces blurry results, Gemini incorrectly removes the street light together, and other models fail to follow instruction. In contrast, ImgEdit-E1 and GPT-4o-Image complete the task perfectly. ImgEdit-E1 and Step1X-Edit align most closely with the prompt in background alteration tasks among all open-source models. For replacing tasks, the results of closed-source models are noticeably more natural, while many open-source models fail to finish the edit. For color modification tasks, only ImgEdit-E1 and the closed-source model accurately follow the instructions while preserving intricate details. Furthermore, only GPT-4o-Image and ImgEdit-E1 successfully perform the object extraction tasks.

### 5.3 Discussion

Based on our benchmark results, we identify three key factors that influence editing model performance: instruction understanding, grounding, and editing. Understanding ability is defined as the capacity of a model to comprehend editing instructions, which is largely determined by the text encoder and strongly affects editing performance. Conventional models using encoders such as T5 [55] or CLIP [54] manage simple tasks (e.g., style transfer) but perform poorly on complex, region-specific tasks. Our evaluations show that ImgEdit-E1 and Step1X-Edit substantially outperform other open-source models, underscoring the importance of stronger text encoders and more

Figure 6: Qualitative Comparison Among Different Editing Models. ImgEdit-E1 surpasses all existing open-source models in instruction adherence, detail preservation, and visual quality, achieving results comparable to those of GPT-4o. Furthermore, owing to the novel editing tasks introduced in ImgEdit, it is capable of performing editing and extraction tasks while preserving identity consistency.

abundant text features. Grounding ability refers to the capacity to accurately identify and localize the specific region requiring editing, which is contingent upon both its ability to comprehend instructions and its visual perception capabilities. In our evaluations, ImgEdit-E1 exhibits superior performance compared to existing open-source editing models in tasks that demand precise localization, such

- as Attribute Alteration and Object Extraction, highlighting the importance of spatial information in prompts. Editing ability is the capacity to generalise across editing operations—depends chiefly on the quality, size, and diversity of the training datasets. The scarcity of high-quality data for Object Extraction yields poor performance on these tasks for other models, including GPT-4o [51], reaffirming the necessity of comprehensive, high-quality editing datasets.

## 6 Conclusion

This paper advances the image editing field by introducing ImgEdit, which overcomes data-quality limitations in existing datasets, introduces practical editing categories, and offers a robust pipeline for future dataset construction. Also, the strong performance of ImgEdit-E1 validates the reliability of ImgEdit. Furthermore, ImgEdit-Bench evaluates models across novel dimensions, offering insights into data selection and architectural design for image-editing models. By providing high-quality datasets, powerful editing methods, and comprehensive evaluation benchmarks, we believe our work helps close the gap between open-source approaches and state-of-the-art closed-source models and drives progress across the entire field of image editing.

## A More Discussion on ImgEdit-E1

### A.1 Details of Text Encoder

We conducted an experiment utilizing GPT-4o to generate detailed image descriptions, which were subsequently input into Flux to synthesize new images. Remarkably, despite Flux lacking access to the original images, the generated images exhibited a notable degree of similarity to the originals. Based on these findings, we posit that a text encoder with enhanced comprehension capabilities and extended context length would significantly improve editing tasks. To this end, we employed Qwen2.5-VL-7B as our text encoder, which supports a context length of up to 8k tokens with outstanding understanding ability. Additionally, Step1X-Edit also leveraged embeddings from the Vision-Language Model (VLM) as input for textual features, achieving superior results and thereby validating our hypothesis.

### A.2 Details of Vision Encoder

The primary distinction between ImgEdit-E1 and the Step1X-Edit model lies in the choice of vision encoder and how the vision features are utilized. In our model, we employed Siglip as the vision encoder, and its vision features were concatenated with the Vision-Language Model (VLM) features to serve as input for the text branch of Flux. In contrast, Step1X-Edit used a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) as the vision encoder, where the vision features were concatenated with noise to serve as input for the image branch. Our decision to use Siglip and its integration with text features was informed by the following findings: (1) The Flux-Redux model demonstrated that replacing text branch features with Siglip features enables basic control over the structural elements of an image. (2) OminiControl [65] also injecting low-level information using VAE, but it requires training a separate model for each task. Step1X-Edit, however, is unable to handle tasks such as generate canny or pose. This raises the question of whether VAE features introduce conflicts between different tasks, which remains unresolved. Based on these observations, we chose Siglip as the vision encoder to provide low-level information.

- A.3 Details of Generation Model

Flux is the current state-of-the-art in generative model, distinguished by its highly effective dualstream architecture for integrating semantics and images. Moreover, its pre-trained weights substantially reduce training costs, making it an ideal foundation for our generative model.

- A.4 Details of Training Strategy

In the first stage of training, we freeze all parameters of Qwen2.5-VL and Flux, allowing only the MLP connecting Qwen2.5-VL to Flux to be trainable. The model is optimized using a global batch size of 128 and using prodigy [50], an adaptive optimizer with a learning rate set to 1.0. In the second stage, the Siglip encoder (Siglip v2-SO/16@512) is integrated to Flux using MLP, which is initialized from the pretrained Flux-Redux model. During this stage, the trainable parameters include the MLP connecting Siglipv2 [68] to Flux, the MLP connecting Qwen2.5VL to Flux, and the image branch of Flux. The second stage also employs the prodigy optimizer with a global batch size of 128. The model is trained for 50,000 steps in the first stage and 10,000 steps in the second stage.

- A.5 Limitations

As the core contribution of this paper is not ImgEdit-E1, we did not perform detailed ablation studies on its model structure, training data, or training process. The architecture of ImgEdit-E1 extends beyond that of a simple editing model; with additional training, it has the potential to evolve into a unified generative model capable of text-to-image generation, image editing, and low-level image processing tasks(e.g., generating canny or depth image). However, while ImgEdit-E1’s editing capabilities are not yet optimal for downstream scenarios such as text generation, this limitation is shared by all current open-source models. Future work will aim to address these limitations and explore the highlighted aspects in greater depth.

## C More Details of ImgEdit Pipeline

### C.1 Additional Details of Pre-Processing

To incorporate positional information into captions, we included the original image resolution and the size of the bounding box in the prompt. GPT generates instructions using the following metadata format: “caption: {caption}, object: {object}, resolution: {resolution}, object bbox: {bbox}” combined with task-specific prompts.

### C.2 Additional Details of In-painting Workflow

We developed an inpainting process tailored to each task by adopting the method from ComfyUI. This approach enables more effective utilization of advanced models within the community while offering a lightweight and user-friendly pipeline. The specific workflow diagram 10 is presented below.

Replace & Background Change Background change can be regarded as an extensive replacement task. Notably, we applied edge softening to the mask to mitigate abrupt transitions and ensure seamless editing effects.

Add & Remove Add and Remove are inverse processes. We adopted a mask inpainting approach and designed prompts incorporating terms such as "empty" and "blank" to achieve the editing results.

Alter For the attribute alteration task, we employed a Canny processor to generate edge maps as control signals. Additionally, we utilized Canny LoRA and ControlNet to perform the inpainting process, followed by softening the edges to enhance visual quality.

Object Extraction & Visual Edit Object extraction and reference replacement are inverse processes. First, an object with a clean background is generated based on the prompt. Then, using Flux-Redux, the object in the real image is replaced with the generated object through in-context processing. The edited image and the object image are saved as use cases for object extraction, while the edited image, object image, and original image are saved as use cases for visual editing.

Style Transfer For style transfer, we employed SDXL due to its superior fidelity in reproducing diverse styles. We also used Canny edge detection to ensure that the finer details of the image remained unchanged.

Hybrid Edit The hybrid edit process followed the steps outlined above. This task was divided into two distinct editing iterations.

Multi-Turn Edit The multi-turn edit process also followed the steps outlined above. It was divided into three editing iterations, each with path dependencies.

## D More Details of ImgEdit-Bench

Instructpix2pix & MagicBrush & UltraEdit: This method extends a pretrained Stable Diffusion model into a image editor by fine-tuning its latent diffusion backbone on automatically generated triplets of (original image, edited image, edit instruction). During training, the network learns to denoise a latent corrupted by noise while simultaneously receiving the latent encoding of the source image and a text embedding of the desired edit. To achieve this, we augment the first convolutional layer with extra channels that concatenate the noisy latent and the source-image latent—these new weights are zero-initialized while all other parameters retain their pretrained values—and we repurpose the model’s native text-conditioning mechanism to process edit instructions instead of

captions. This lightweight adaptation harnesses the rich generative knowledge of the original model and enables it to perform high-fidelity, instruction-guided edits with minimal additional training.

AnySD: First, a visual prompt projector takes CLIP-encoded image features and aligns them with text instructions, then injects this joint “visual prompt” into the UNet at each denoising step via cross-attention. Second, task-aware routing embeds Mixture-of-Experts blocks throughout the UNet: a lightweight router-informed by task embeddings—dynamically allocates each edit request to a subset of expert layers, so that different tasks invoke specialized attention pathways. Third, learnable task embeddings are inserted just before these MoE blocks to both shape the visual prompt and drive the decisions of router, ensuring that each editing operation fires at the right scale and scope.

Step1X-Edit: The model fuses a multimedia large language model (MLLM), a lightweight connector, and a Diffusion-in-Transformer (DiT) backbone to deliver precise, context-aware image edits. First, the user’s edit instruction and reference image are jointly fed into a frozen MLLM (e.g. QwenVL) and become text feature input to our DiT network. In parallel, we average the MLLM’s output tokens and project them into a global visual guidance vector, injecting rich semantic context into the diffusion process. To train the connector and DiT in tandem, they concat a noise-corrupted target image and a clean reference image into token sequences, and presenting this fused feature to the DiT. By initializing from pretrained Qwen and DiT weights and optimizing both modules jointly

- at a low learning rate, our method achieves high-fidelity, semantically aligned edits across a wide variety of user instructions.
