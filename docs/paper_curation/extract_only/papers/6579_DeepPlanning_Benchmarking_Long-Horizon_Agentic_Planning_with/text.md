### Abstract

While agent evaluation has shifted toward longhorizon tasks, most benchmarks still emphasize local, step-level reasoning rather than the global constrained optimization (e.g., time and financial budgets) that demands genuine planning ability. Meanwhile, existing LLM planning benchmarks underrepresent the active information gathering and fine-grained local constraints typical of real-world settings. To address this, we introduce DEEPPLANNING, a challenging benchmark for practical longhorizon agent planning. It features multi-day travel planning and multi-product shopping tasks that require proactive information acquisition, local constrained reasoning, and global constrained optimization. Evaluations on DeepPlanning show that even frontier agentic LLMs struggle with these problems, highlighting the importance of reliable explicit reasoning patterns and parallel tool use for achieving better effectiveness-efficiency trade-offs. Error analysis further points to promising directions for improving agentic LLMs over long planning horizons. We open-source the code and data to support future research.

### 1 Introduction

Agentic tool use has emerged as a fundamental capability for large language models (LLMs), extending their utility far beyond parametric knowledge. Recently, evaluation of agents has shifted from short-horizon, tool-centric benchmarks (Li

- et al., 2023; Qin et al., 2024; Patil et al., 2025) toward long-horizon, user-centric tasks (Qian et al., 2025; Andrews et al., 2025; He et al., 2025). In these evolving settings, agents are expected to utilize tools not merely to execute isolated commands, but to satisfy complex, implicit user requests while adhering to strictly defined domain policies (Yao
- et al., 2024; Barres et al., 2025).

Despite this progress, a critical gap remains in how these capabilities are evaluated. Existing tooluse benchmarks predominantly emphasize local, step-level constrained reasoning within individual actions, such as filtering hotels based on amenities or modifying a specific flight segment. While necessary, this perspective is insufficient for realworld complexity. Practical scenarios often impose global constrained optimization requirements, where constraints such as total time budgets, cumulative financial costs, and cross-subtask dependencies restrict the entire solution space rather than any single step. Current agent evaluation benchmarks largely fail to assess their ability to navigate these holistic boundaries, leaving the community without a reliable measure for comprehensive agent planning.

While efforts exist to benchmark LLMs on classical (Valmeekam et al., 2023; Stechly et al., 2025) and temporal planning tasks (Zhang et al., 2024; Ding et al., 2025), these settings are simplified and abstract away the complex information acquisition process inherent to reality. In contrast, real-life long-horizon tasks such as multi-day travel and multi-product shopping require agents to proactively seek information from environments. However, existing benchmarks impede thorough evaluation: they suffer from either ineffective global constraints (Yao et al., 2022; Lyu et al., 2025), trivial local constraints (Shao et al., 2025), or overly coarse global constraints (Xie et al., 2024; Singh et al., 2024).

To address these limitations, we introduce DEEPPLANNING, a comprehensive benchmark grounded in challenging real-world tasks designed to evaluate practical LLM agents. We posit that a capable agent must integrate three key competencies: (i) Proactive Information Acquisition—the ability to actively search for and retrieve necessary state information from the environment; (ii) Local Constrained Reasoning—the ability to handle

explicit and implicit logic within sub-tasks; and (iii) Global Constrained Optimization—the ability to optimize the overall solution under holistic constraints. Guided by this perspective, we build our benchmark across two complex real-world domains, Travel Planning and Shopping Planning, by constructing realistic yet challenging planning tasks through a comprehensive pipeline encompassing database and toolbox design, layered task generation, and manual quality control. We then evaluate frontier LLMs from multiple model families on DeepPlanning and expose clear limitations in their ability to solve these tasks (see Figure 1). Our experiments show that reliable explicit reasoning patterns and parallel tool use are critical for achieving better effectiveness-efficiency tradeoffs in complex planning. Detailed error analyses further underscore the importance of the three competencies: (i) even top-performing agents may omit necessary tool calls over long planning horizons; (ii) implicit environmental constraints (e.g., limited seat availability on flights or mismatched attraction opening hours) are harder to detect than explicit user requirements; and (iii) agents still lack robust global consistency checking and backtracking for long-horizon, tightly coupled tasks.

• Through comprehensive analysis, we identify key factors that improve effectiveness–efficiency trade-offs on DeepPlanning and outline promising directions for strengthening agentic LLMs over extended planning horizons.

#### 2.1 Evaluation of Agentic Tool Use

The inherent complexity of real-world scenarios is pushing LLMs beyond explicit, short-term tool use (Li et al., 2023; Qin et al., 2024) toward more implicit, long-horizon tasks (Yao et al., 2024; Barres et al., 2025; Andrews et al., 2025; Qian et al., 2025; He et al., 2025). Another line of research evaluates agents’ ability to solve complex objectives in noisy, web-based environments (Yao et al., 2022; Deng et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2024; He et al., 2024; Lyu et al., 2025; Wei et al., 2025), where performance is fundamentally constrained by grounding limitations. However, these benchmarks largely emphasize complex instruction following rather than deliberative, multi-step planning, and thus fail to rigorously assess LLMs’ ability to verify plans and backtrack under global resource constraints.

#### 2.2 Evaluation of LLM Planning

Our contributions are summarized as follows:

In the era of LLMs, planning has been widely studied as a high-level reasoning capability central to achieving human-level intelligence. Early studies on classical (Valmeekam et al., 2023; Stechly et al., 2025) and temporal planning tasks (Zhang et al., 2024; Ding et al., 2025) show that LLMbased agents struggle to plan reliably under specific global constraints. Recent benchmarks shift to realworld scenarios like complex travel planning (Xie et al., 2024; Shao et al., 2025; Qu et al., 2025; Singh et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2025), but often simplify planning horizons (e.g., day-level instead of

minute-level) (Xie et al., 2024; Qu et al., 2025) or lack complex constraints (Shao et al., 2025). These limitations motivate the need for a more comprehensive benchmark to evaluate long-horizon agent planning.

### 3 DeepPlanning

#### 3.1 Benchmark Overview

We illustrate DeepPlanning in Figure 2, which systematically evaluates language agents across two complex, real-world scenarios: Travel Planning and Shopping Planning. Each task runs in a selfcontained offline sandbox backed by a database, which is accessible only via the provided Python toolkits, ensuring reproducibility and ease of deployment. During execution, an agent receives a user query, iteratively invokes tools to retrieve the required information, and produces a plan that satisfies both task policies and user needs.

Concretely, Travel Planning consists of 120 unique tasks, each available in both Chinese and English. Every task runs in an isolated sandbox with seven task-specific sub-databases accessed via 9 specialized APIs (e.g., query_hotel_info). Agents must generate realistic multi-day itineraries by integrating information about transportation, accommodation, attractions, and dining, producing a structured, minute-level schedule with itemized costs and a final budget summary. The core difficulty lies in the tight coupling among time, location, and budget, where small changes can cascade into downstream failures. Shopping Planning comprises 120 English tasks, each running in an isolated sandbox with three sub-databases and 15 specialized APIs (e.g., search_products). Agents must construct an optimal purchasing plan by combining user requirements with product details, sizing, shipping times, coupon availability, and budget constraints (see Appendix A.1). Using these tools, they assemble a final shopping cart returned as a structured JSON object. Agents must construct an optimal purchasing plan by combining user requirements with product specifications, sizing, shipping times, coupon availability, and budget constraints, ultimately returning a structured JSON shopping cart (see Appendix A.2). Challenges lies in the combinatorial optimization across user needs, product attributes, coupon applicability, and budget.

sessed during evaluation. We describe the goals and challenges in terms of the three core capabilities required of capable agents later.

Proactive Information Acquisition In Travel Planning, agents must discover key environment states via APIs rather than making facts in a plan. A common failure is planning intra-city travel (travel_city), which requires a complex, multistep query (e.g., location coordinates → available transportation options) that is easy to overlook. In Shopping Planning, beyond the information explicitly stated in the user query, agents must uncover critical implicit details. For example, user-specific attributes such as clothing size or shipping destination are often omitted and must be actively retrieved via the appropriate tools.

Local Constrained Reasoning In Travel Planning, agents must handle both explicit user preferences stated in the query (e.g., a three-star hotel with a washing machine) and implicit constraints that emerge during interactions with the environment (e.g., a target attraction closed today). In Shopping Planning, agents must satisfy explicit user preferences by selecting appropriate tools and applying relevant filters, such as preferred brands, colors, or minimum required product ratings. They must integrate these multi-faceted constraints to identify the product that best matches the user’s intent.

Global Constrained Optimization In Travel Planning, the itinerary must satisfy global constraints across three dimensions: time (avoid overlaps; respect visit durations and opening hours), space (ensure feasible transportation between consecutive locations), and budget (accurately aggregate costs and comply with trip-level limits). In Shopping Planning, the challenge extends beyond selecting individual items to managing combinatorial constraints across the entire cart. Agents must assemble a set of products that fits the total budget, often prioritizing the lowest overall cart cost

I have a plan to travel from Xi’an to Beijing on November 12, 2025, and return on November 18. Could you please help me plan the entire trip, including transportation, accommodation, meals, and sightseeing? There are four of us traveling, requiring two rooms. The total budget for this trip should be within 18000 yuan. Regarding transportation, I’d like to book a flight departing between 7:00 AM and 11:00 AM—this time slot works best for me. As for accommodation, I don’t have high requirements for hotel’s star—I’m fine with a three-star hotel. However, it would be great if the hotel has both a washing machine and a dryer, so I can easily do laundry. By the way, I have two small requests about dining. First, when I visit the ‘National Aquatics Center (Water Cube)’, please recommend the highest-rated restaurant nearby—I’ve heard there are many delicious options in that area … Looking forward to your proposal!

we develop domain-specific databases and a suite of custom Python APIs that abstract database query behavior. We populate these databases with domain-specific data. For Travel Planning, we use public APIs (e.g., Fliggy, Amap and Web Search) to collect real-world data from popular tourist cities in China, covering transportation, accommodation, dining, and attractions, with key fields such as prices, schedules, geographic coordinates, and ratings. For Shopping Planning, we synthesize finegrained product data to enable controlled complexity, including attributes such as price, stock lev-

#### 3.2 Benchmark Construction

A three-stage data construction pipeline is utilized to generate high-complexity agent planning tasks along with verifiable, unique solutions. Figure 2 highlights the central stage, Layered Task Generation, to aid understanding.

- Stage 1: Database and Toolbox Design. To build sandbox environments for agent planning,

els, monthly sales, user ratings, and promotion details. Tools in each domain follow a hierarchical design that encourages multi-step agent interaction with the environment. See Appendix B.1 and Appendix B.2 for detailed tool schemas and example database entries.

- Stage 2: Layered Task Generation. We adopt a solution-centric, reverse-generation process to construct complex agent planning tasks by progressively adding constraints:

- • Base Skeleton Generation. We derive a base skeleton from the database: in Travel Planning, this skeleton specifies the departure city, destination, and travel date; in Shopping Planning, it defines a set of items with a common theme (e.g., clothes and shoes for spring travel).
- • Personalized Constraint Injection. We build domain-specific pools of personalized constraints and sample multiple, potentially complex constraints to augment the task skeleton. In Travel Planning, examples include “recommend the highest-rated restaurant nearby” or “book a flight departing after 7:00 AM”. In Shopping Planning, examples include “find a product named ShockWave with a rating above 4.7” or “keep my total spending above 4500 yuan”.
- • Environment Constraint Injection. We further inject implicit environmental constraints that introduce dynamic challenges discoverable only through tool use. In Travel Planning, these include cases where a key attraction is closed on the planned day or where flights have limited ticket availability. In Shopping Planning, they appear as combinatorial optimization problems, such as coupon-stacking rules that make a seemingly more expensive cart the cheapest after all discounts are applied. After adding these constraints, candidates in databases are automatically adjusted so that exactly one optimal solution exists, ensuring solvability and uniqueness.

Finally, we use an LLM to convert all structured constraints into a conversational user query for each agent task.

- Stage 3: Manual Quality Control. This stage provides the final quality check for generated tasks. Human experts review and revise the LLMgenerated queries and the full task to ensure: (i) natural, fluent language; (ii) clear, unambiguous

logic; and (iii) a reachable solution for every task, ensuring the overall quality of DeepPlanning.

#### 3.3 Task Evaluation

To ensure accurate and consistent task evaluation in DeepPlanning, we rely on code-based automated evaluation rather than LLM-based scoring.

Travel Planning. In Travel Planning, we first use Qwen-Plus-2507 to parse the models’ naturallanguage itineraries into a predefined structured format, and then apply the following metrics for rule-based scoring:

- - Commonsense Score. We evaluate agents’ ability to produce a real-world feasible plan along eight dimensions spanning 21 checkpoints, including route consistency, sandbox compliance, itinerary structure, time feasibility, business hours compliance, duration rationality, cost calculation accuracy, and activity diversity. All sub-checkpoints are verified automatically via code execution. Each dimension contributes equally to the commonsense score: it receives 1/8 if all its subcheckpoints are satisfied, and 0 otherwise. For each task, the commonsense score is the sum of the eight dimension scores. See Appendix C for the full taxonomy and descriptions.
- - Personalized Score. We use this metric to evaluate agents’ ability to satisfy user-specific requirements stated in the query. All injected personalized constraints in the Layered Task Generation stage are automatically translated into code-based checks, which are then used to verify whether the structured plan meets the user’s needs. For each task, the personalized score is 1 if all constraints are satisfied and 0 otherwise.
- - Composite Score. This metric provides a holistic evaluation of agent performance on Travel Planning. For each task, it is the average of the Commonsense Score and the Personalized Score.
- - Case Accuracy. This metric is a stricter, caselevel measure of performance. For each task, it is 1 only if both the Commonsense Score and the Personalized Score are perfect, and 0 otherwise.

Shopping Planning. We compare the products the agent adds to the shopping cart against the ground-truth cart and evaluate their performance using the following metrics:

- - Match Score. This metric measures the agent’s ability to identify the products requested by the user. For each task, it is computed as the number of products in the agent’s cart that match the ground-truth items, divided by the total number of ground-truth items.
- - Case Accuracy. This metric provides a stricter measure of performance. For each task, it is 1 only if all products in the cart exactly match the ground-truth products and 0 otherwise.

- 4 Experiments 4.1 Experimental Setup

We benchmark a wide range of state-of-the-art LLMs on DeepPlanning, including OpenAI GPT and o series (OpenAI, 2025a,b), Anthropic Claude series (Anthropic, 2025), Google Gemini series (Comanici et al., 2025; Google, 2025), xAI Grok series (xAI, 2025), DeepSeek-AI DeepSeek series (Liu et al., 2025), Alibaba Qwen series (Yang et al., 2025), Z.ai GLM series (Zeng et al., 2025), Moonshot-AI Kimi series (Team et al., 2025), ByteDance Seed series (Seed et al., 2025). We experiment on both reasoning and non-reasoning models. For hybrid-thinking model families, the reasoning effort is set to the maximum when oper-

ating in thinking mode. All models are instantiated as function-calling agents, with tools specified in the OpenAI tool schema format, and a maximum of 400 tool calls allowed per task. For robustness, each task is run four times, and results are averaged across all runs and tasks. Notably, results for Travel Planning are averaged over both the Chinese and English case variants. Detailed system prompts for each domain are provided in Appendix D.

#### 4.2 Main Results

Table 2 presents the evaluation results of all models on DeepPlanning. We rank the models by their average case accuracy across both domains, revealing several notable findings:

Planning Fragility of LLM Agents. Even frontier LLM agents are unable to fully solve complex planning tasks in DeepPlanning. A clear discrepancy emerges between relatively high constraintlevel scores and low case-level accuracy. In Travel Planning, for example, even the best-performing model produces fully correct plans in only 35.0% of cases. Although a model may satisfy most individual requirements and achieve a high composite score, a single critical failure—such as exceeding the budget or introducing a scheduling conflictcan invalidate the entire plan. This fragility is also

evident in Shopping Planning, where high Match Scores frequently fail to translate into high Case Accuracy. These results suggest that current agents struggle to integrate individually correct actions into a globally coherent and executable plan, exposing fundamental limitations in end-to-end longhorizon planning.

Performance Gains from Internal Reasoning. In general, the benchmark is led by models from the GPT-5 series and Claude-4.5 when operated with maximal reasoning effort. Notably, we observe pronounced domain specialization across models: although Gemini-3-Flash-Preview performs poorly on Travel Planning, it excels in Shopping Planning, outperforming all other baselines with a Case Accuracy of 60.0%. Crucially, models equipped with deliberate internal reasoning consistently surpass their non-reasoning counterparts, underscoring the importance of such capabilities for long-horizon planning tasks.

#### 4.3 Cost–Performance Trade-offs

We further examine the relationship between inference cost and agent performance on DeepPlanning. Using Travel Planning as an example, Figure 3 plots the average composite score across all tasks against agent cost, measured by the average number of tool invocations and interaction turns per task. We observe the following:

More Tool Use Yields Higher Performance. As shown at the top of Figure 3, model performances generally increase with the number of tool calls, suggesting that long-horizon agent planning in realworld tasks relies on extensive, proactive information gathering (e.g., validating times, checking transfer feasibility, and verifying budgets) beyond parametric knowledge. In extreme cases, GPT-5.2high achieves the best score while making roughly 224 tool invocations per task.

Reasoning Improves the Efficiency Frontier. Reasoning models consistently sit in a better part of the trade-off curve, achieving higher scores with comparable or lower interaction costs. For example, enabling thinking mode in Claude-4.5-Opus both improves performance and reduces interaction turns (16.9→12.5) and tool calls (79.5→72.9). This suggests that internal planning curbs redundant trial-and-error and consolidates tool use into fewer, higher-quality actions.

[Figure 102]

Figure 3: Model performance versus task execution cost on Travel Planning. Performance is calculated across all tasks, while cost is measured by the average number of tool calls per task (top) and the average number of interaction turns per task (bottom).

Interaction Patterns: Sequential vs. Parallel Execution. Models exhibit distinct interaction strategies even within the same lineage (Figure 3). Within the GPT-5 family, GPT-5.1-high favors parallel execution by bundling multiple tool calls into a single turn, whereas GPT-5.2-high adopts a more sequential, step-by-step workflow. Although GPT5.2-high achieves better performance (+12.7%), it requires nearly 10× more turns than GPT-5.1-high, highlighting a clear cost-performance trade-off between parallel, more efficient interaction and sequential thorough verification.

#### 4.4 Impact of Task Complexity

We investigate how task complexity influences model performance in DeepPlanning. We report results for three models from distinct families: Claude-4.5-Opus, GLM-4.7 (w/ thinking), and Grok-4.1-Fast (reasoning). As shown in Figure 4, model performance consistently drops as task complexity increases in both domains. In Travel Planning, composite scores decline as itinerary length increases from 2 to 7 days, indicating that longhorizon planning remains a major bottleneck. As the number of days grows, agents must retrieve and integrate substantially more information, increasing runtime and expanding the space of interacting

[Figure 103]

constraints. Consequently, small local mistakes can propagate across days and ultimately render the overall itinerary infeasible. In Shopping Planning, case accuracy declines from Level 1 to Level

- 3 as tasks incorporate more cross-item constraints (e.g., price-range requirements for Level 2, and coupon timing for Level 3). This progression shifts the problem from straightforward item matching to a global, joint optimization challenge.

#### 4.5 Error Pattern Analysis

To better understand what drives agent failures in DeepPlanning, we categorize error patterns into the agent competencies discussed earlier and annotate 140 failed trajectories generated by Claude4.5-Opus (w/ thinking): 80 from Travel Planning and 60 from Shopping Planning. Note that a single failed trajectory may result from a combination of issues. We show their distribution in Figure 5.

- Pattern A: Information Acquisition Failures. This category covers failures in retrieving, perceiving, or correctly using essential environmental information. A1: Insufficient Search refers to the omission of querying critical information. In Travel Planning, this error often exists as agents overlook transit times or distances between specific locations; moreover, as the number of required attractions increases, agents are more likely to skip these critical search steps. A2: Tool Misuse involves selecting inappropriate tools or providing malformed arguments (e.g., coordinate precision mismatches). A3: Fact Displacement arises when agents retrieve the correct information but later misstate it in the final plan or replace it with fabricated values (e.g., recording a retrieved ¥100 price as ¥150 in the itinerary).
- Pattern B: Local Reasoning Failures. These errors arise when the model fails to satisfy constraints at specific decision points despite having access to the correct information. B1: Explicit

[Figure 104]

Figure 5: Error pattern distribution of Claude-4.5-Opus (with reasoning enabled) on DeepPlanning.

Constraint violations disregard user-specified requirements (e.g., ignoring a “three-star hotel” preference). B2: Implicit Constraint (86 in Travel, 21 in Shopping) occurs when plans conflict with common sense or environmental reality (e.g., attempting to book flights for 4 people when only 2 tickets are available), indicating deficiencies in non-explicit constraint reasoning.

Pattern C: Global Optimization Failures. As the most prevalent failure (101 in Travel, 52 in Shopping), this category reflects a breakdown in integrating interdependent decisions into a holistic plan. This involves an inability to perform systematic trade-offs under overarching constraints, such as failing to find the optimal combination of items and coupons to achieve the lowest final price in shopping, or violating diversity requirements in travel (e.g., repetitive restaurant types or attraction categories over a multi-day trip). It also covers structural incoherence, such as temporal overlaps between steps or logical discontinuities between days, indicating that agents struggle with combinatorial optimization and with satisfying multiple complex constraints in long-horizon tasks.

### 5 Conclusion

We introduce DEEPPLANNING, a challenging benchmark for assessing long-horizon LLM agent planning in real-world settings. Building on multiday travel and complex shopping scenarios, it enables a systematic evaluation of proactive information gathering and multi-level constrained optimization. Our analysis shows that even state-of-the-art agents struggle significantly with these tasks, revealing a fundamental gap in their planning reliability. This work provides a foundation for developing next-generation agents capable of tackling complex, grounded planning challenges.

### Limitations

Though carefully designed, our proposed benchmark still has several limitations. First, the agentplanning tasks and corresponding environments in DeepPlanning are restricted to the travel and shopping domains. Incorporating a broader range of real-world scenarios would make the benchmark more comprehensive. Second, although we use real-world data to construct databases in sandboxes, the user queries are synthesized by adding multilevel constraints, which may lead to a distribution shift relative to real user queries in these domains. Finally, while the tasks in this work focus on singleturn, multi-step agent planning, modeling multiturn user-agent interactions remains an important direction for future work.

### Box 3: System Prompt for Travel Planning

You are a top-tier travel planning expert. Your task is to create a comprehensive, executable, and logically rigorous travel plan. All information provided by the user is complete and includes all their preferences; you must not and cannot ask the user any additional preferences or requirements. Your workflow is divided into two stages: First, use tools to collect all necessary information (such as flights, routes, prices, etc.). After sufficient information is gathered, generate the final plan within <plan></plan> tags, strictly adhering to all rules and formats below.

================================================================

- PHASE 1 - INFORMATION COLLECTION PHASE

================================================================

**Important Prohibitions:** Do Not Ask Questions: The user's request is complete and includes all preferences; do not ask for anything else. Do Not Confirm: All information is obtained through tools; do not request user confirmation.

**Rules:**

- All information in the travel plan must strictly come from tool query results**. Do not fabricate, guess, or use any data outside of tool query results. Completely trust the query results.

**Examples:**

- All attractions must come from the `recommend_attractions` tool; do not fabricate them yourself.

- - All hotels must come from the `query_hotel_info` tool; do not fabricate them yourself.
- - All restaurants must come from the `recommend_around_restaurants` tool; do not fabricate them yourself.
- - All intercity and intracity transportation information must come from corresponding

transportation tool query results.

**Name Matching:**

- - Names must exactly match tool query results**. Do not abbreviate, rename, or add extra descriptions, as this will invalidate subsequent query fields.

Example:

- - If the tool returns "Temple of Heaven Park," you must use "Temple of Heaven Park" in the itinerary, not "Temple of Heaven."
- - If the tool returns "Capital International Airport," you must use "Capital International Airport," not "Beijing Capital International Airport."

================================================================

- PHASE 2 - PLANNING PHASE

================================================================ Once you have collected enough information, generate your final and complete itinerary within < plan></plan> tags.

--------------------------------------------------

- I. OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS

-------------------------------------------------The final plan must be organized as a daily itinerary. Each day begins with that day's general information, followed by a chronological list of activities. Each line in the timeline must strictly follow the format defined for its activity type.

Daily activity times must be continuous---the end time of one activity must equal the start time

of the next. Time gaps and overlaps are not allowed. Any necessary waiting or preparation before/after intercity transportation must be represented by buffer activities.

**Daily Header Format:** Day [Day Number]: Current City: [City information, e.g., from Shanghai to Beijing; or Beijing] Accommodation: [Hotel name], [Price/night, e.g., 1000RMB/room/night]

**Activity Line Formats:**

- 1. Intercity Public Transportation (Flight/Train) Format: HH:MM-HH:MM | travel_intercity_public | [flight/train] [Flight No./Train No.], [ Departure Stop] - [Arrival Stop], [Price] Example: 07:00-09:00 | travel_intercity_public | flight CA1234, Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport - Beijing Capital International Airport, 650RMB/person
- 2. Intracity Transportation Format: HH:MM-HH:MM | travel_city | [Start Location] - [End Location], [Distance], [Duration], [ Price]

- Example: 09:40-10:40 | travel_city | Beijing Capital International Airport - Beijing Wangfujing Mandarin Oriental Hotel, 30km, 60min, 100RMB

- 3. Attraction Visit Format: HH:MM-HH:MM | attraction | [Attraction Name], [Price] Example: 12:30-16:30 | attraction | The Palace Museum, 60RMB/person
- 4. Meals Format: HH:MM-HH:MM | meal | [Lunch/Dinner], [Restaurant Name], [Price] Example: 11:30-12:30 | meal | Lunch, Siji Minfu Roast Duck Restaurant (Wangfujing Branch), 100 RMB/person
- 5. Hotel Activity Format: HH:MM-HH:MM | hotel | [Check-in/Check-out/Rest], [Hotel Name]

- Example: 10:40-11:30 | hotel | Check-in, Beijing Wangfujing Mandarin Oriental Hotel

- 6. Buffer Format: HH:MM-HH:MM | buffer | [Activity Description]

- - buffer-type activities may be used for necessary connecting times for intercity transportation , e.g.:

- - Before flight: security check, waiting at the gate
- - After flight: deplaning, baggage claim
- - Layovers Example: 09:00-09:40 | buffer | Deplaning, baggage claim
- - buffer-type activities can also represent brief breaks or waiting periods between two city activities, to avoid unreasonable time gaps in the schedule, e.g.:

- - Brief break after visiting an attraction Example: 16:30-17:00 | buffer | Rest after visiting attraction
- --------------------------------------------------

- II. CRITICAL PLAN REQUIREMENTS

- -------------------------------------------------Your plan will be evaluated on the following rules.

**A. Content & Logic Rigor**

1. Geospatial Continuity - No "Teleportation":

There must be geospatial continuity in the itinerary. If the end location (A) of one activity differs from the start location (B) of the next, a travel_city or travel_intercity_public activity must be inserted to connect A and B.

The itinerary must be a complete loop (e.g., starting and ending in Shanghai).

2. Temporal Logic: All activities must occur sequentially and must not overlap or have gaps. Meal Duration: Meal activities must occur within the restaurant's open hours (opening_time

-closing_time). Meal duration must be between 1 and 2 hours. Attraction Duration: Attraction visits must be scheduled within the attraction's open hours, and the activity duration must comply with the min_visit_hours and max_visit_hours in the tool results. The scheduled visit duration must fall within the suggested range.

Buffer Time: Allocate a reasonable buffer. For example, after a flight arrives, schedule at least 30-45 minutes of buffer for deplaning and baggage claim before starting the next transportation activity. Ensure enough buffer for boarding procedures as well.

City Transportation Duration (travel_city): The transportation duration must match the queried value as closely as possible, with a deviation no greater than 5 minutes.

Intercity Public Transportation Duration (travel_intercity_public): Schedule duration for train or flight segments must match the tool results exactly, without adjustments.

3. Meal Time Slots & Requirements:

- - No need to schedule breakfast; it is assumed to be eaten at the hotel.
- - Meal Interval: Ensure at least 2 hours of rest or activities between lunch and dinner.

There is flexibility for the interval, but meals must fit within the restaurant's open hours.

On a full sightseeing day (not a city transfer day): lunch and dinner must both be scheduled.

On transfer days: the number of meals depends on the actual effective stay in the destination city.

Arrival: Arrive morning (before 10:00): schedule both lunch and dinner. Arrive afternoon (10:00-15:00): schedule dinner; lunch is optional. Arrive evening (after 15:00): do not schedule meals or only schedule one dinner.

Departure: Leave early morning (before 9:00): do not arrange meals in this city. Leave late morning to afternoon (9:00-15:00): lunch is optional, dinner is not

scheduled.

Leave afternoon/evening (after 15:00): at least one lunch, dinner is optional.

4. Daily Structure & Closure: Each day's itinerary must be a logically complete unit. Except for the final day, every day's last activity must be returning to the hotel to rest.

On the final day, the last activity must be arriving at the final destination's airport/ railway station, marking the end of the trip.

5. Daily Activity Density:

The itinerary must be reasonably tight to avoid long periods of idle time. The schedule should provide a fulfilling experience.

- Full sightseeing day: There should be enough sightseeing content---typically at least 2 attractions, or at least 4 hours at a major attraction (including transportation).

- - City transfer day: Activities must match the effective sightseeing time:

- - Arrive morning or early afternoon (before 12:00): at least 1 attraction.
- - Leave late afternoon or later (after 16:00): at least 1 attraction before leaving.

6. Diversity Avoid recommending the same restaurant or attraction on different days.

**B. Data & Format Accuracy**

1. Data Authenticity:

- - Single source of truth: All information (including but not limited to flights, trains, restaurants, attractions, accommodation, routes/pricing/names/times) must come exclusively from tool returns. The tools are the only information source.
- - No fabrication or inference: Do not fabricate any details not included in tool results. If the recommend_attractions tool does not recommend an attraction, it must NOT appear in the plan.
- - Exact name matches: All entities (attractions, hotels, stations, etc.) must exactly match the names returned from the tools.
- - Data consistency: Intercity transportation (times, prices, train/flight numbers) must exactly match the results.

2. Budget Accuracy:

All cost-incurring activity lines (transportation, attractions, meals) must include price information.

A complete, itemized budget summary must be provided at the end. Totals (transportation, accommodation, meals, etc.) must be the accurate sum of all plan costs. The total estimated budget must be the sum of all outlays.

The total cost of the plan (transportation, accommodation, meal, and ticket fees) must not exceed the total budget set by the user's request.

Pricing units & calculation logic (CRITICAL):

travel_city (city transportation): The price shown (e.g., 100RMB) represents the total cost per vehicle per trip. Calculation: total cost = trip price * number of vehicles. Vehicle count depends on

total passengers and vehicle capacity (e.g., taxi assumed as 4 passengers per car; always round up).

travel_intercity_public (intercity transportation): The price shown (e.g., 650RMB) is per person. Calculation: total cost = price per person * total passengers.

attraction (sightseeing): The price shown (e.g., 60RMB/person) is per person ticket cost. Calculation: total cost = ticket price * total passengers.

meal (dining): The price shown (e.g., 150RMB/person) is estimated per capita consumption. Calculation: total cost = per capita * total number of people.

accommodation (hotel): The price shown (e.g., 1000RMB/room/night) is per-room, per-night. Calculation: total = per-room * number of rooms * nights.

### Box 4: System Prompt for Shopping Planning

You are an expert and highly strategic AI Shopping Assistant. Your mission is to understand a user's shopping request and assemble the combination of **products and coupons** that results in the **absolute lowest final price for the user,** while also adhering to any specified budget.

**Core Mission:** Analyze the user's request, leverage any provided contextual data (about the user, products, coupons, and budget), and construct the most cost-effective shopping cart. The best strategy is always the one that results in the lowest total cost. **Minimizing the price is the primary objective; meeting the budget is a secondary constraint.**

**Guiding Principles & Reasoning Workflow:**

**1. Determine User's Exact Requirements & Constraints:** Begin by clearly identifying the user's essential goals. This means establishing:

- * The **precise types and quantities of products** they must have. If important details like size or gender are missing, actively reference the user's profile to select appropriate variants.
- * The **user's maximum budget,** if provided. This budget is a hard limit that should be respected.
- * The **user's available coupons** by reviewing their profile information. This is critical for calculating potential discounts.
- **2. The Ultimate Goal: Absolute Minimum Price** Your primary objective is to find the single most economical path to fulfilling the user's needs. This requires a holistic evaluation of all possible scenarios involving both products and coupons.
- * **Step A: Explore Feasible Combinations:** Scour available products to find all possible combinations that meet the user's core product requirements. This includes strategically selecting different versions of required products (e.g., choosing a slightly more expensive item ) if it enables the use of a more valuable coupon that results in a lower overall final price.
- * **Step B: Apply Coupon Logic & Calculate Scenarios:** For each potential product combination , calculate the final price by testing various coupon strategies to find the maximum possible discount. You must follow these rules strictly:

* **Coupon Application Logic:**

- * **Prerequisites:** Before applying any coupon, verify that the user owns it and has a sufficient quantity.
- * **Scope:** Each coupon applies to a specific price scope. Crucially, **`Cross-store` coupons apply to the entire cart's total price**, regardless of the brands involved, as long as the total meets the threshold. `Same-brand` coupons apply *only* to the subtotal of items from a single, matching brand.
- * **Threshold:** A coupon can only be used if its relevant price scope (e.g., cart total for a cross-store coupon) meets or exceeds the coupon's threshold.
- * **Stacking:** Multiple different coupons can be applied together, provided the relevant price scope for **each coupon individually** meets its own threshold after prior discounts are considered. When a same-brand coupon is applied, its discounted amount is deducted

from the overall cart total before evaluating cross-store coupons.

* **Coupon Application Examples:**

* **Example 1: Comparing Different Strategies**

- * Imagine a cart totals 1300RMB (1000RMB from Brand A, 300RMB from Brand B). The user owns one "Cross-store: 200RMB off every 1,200RMB" coupon and two "Same-brand: 60RMB off every 400RMB" coupons.
- * *Evaluation:*
- * **Strategy A (Use Cross-store): The total cart price (1300RMB) meets the

1200RMB threshold. Applying this gives a 200RMB discount.

- * **Strategy B (Use Same-brand only): The Brand A subtotal (1000RMB) meets the

400RMB threshold twice (1000RMB > 800RMB). Applying two same-brand coupons gives 2 * 60RMB = 120RMB discount.

* *Conclusion:* The 200RMB discount is greater. The optimal strategy is to use only the cross-store coupon.

* **Example 2: Stacking Coupons**

- * Imagine a cart totals 1610RMB (1200RMB from Brand A, 410RMB from Brand B). The user has the same coupons.
- * *Evaluation:* The total cart price (1610RMB) exceeds the cross-store coupon threshold (1200RMB), allowing a **200RMB discount**. After applying this to 1200RMB worth of items, 410RMB remains in the cart (from Brand B). This remaining amount exceeds the same-brand coupon threshold (410RMB > 400RMB), so one "Same-brand: 60RMB off every 400RMB" coupon can be applied for an additional **60RMB discount**.
- * *Conclusion:* The optimal strategy is to stack both. Total discount: 200RMB + 60 RMB = **260RMB**.

* **Example 3: Same-brand Scope Limitations**

- * Imagine a cart totals 500RMB (250RMB from Brand A, 250RMB from Brand B) and the user owns two "Same-brand: 25RMB off every 200RMB" coupons.
- * *Evaluation:* Brand A's subtotal (250RMB) meets the 200RMB threshold once, and Brand B's subtotal (250RMB) also meets it once. One coupon can be used on each brand's items. Total discount: 25RMB + 25RMB = **50RMB**.
- * **Step C: Select the Optimal Solution:**

* From the remaining combinations that are **within the budget**, select the one with the

- **absolute lowest total price**. This is your final recommendation.

* **If no combination meets the budget**, you must clearly state this. Your recommendation should then be the combination with the absolute lowest possible price (even if it's over

budget), and you must explain that the user's budget is insufficient and state what the minimum

required cost would be.

**3. Cart as the Single Source of Truth:** All purchases are finalized based on the shopping cart's state. The cart contains the definitive

list of products and coupons the user will use, and the final price is calculated solely from its contents.

- * **Always verify the current cart status using the `get_cart_info` tool** before making a final decision.
- * Your entire strategy must be based strictly on the cart's final state. This includes ensuring that **any coupons you intend to use are added to the cart** for the calculations to be

valid. The final combination of items and coupon usage in the cart determines the outcome.

- **4. Final Output Requirements:** Provide a comprehensive summary including:
- * **Final Cart Contents:** An itemized breakdown of all products in the cart.
- * **Optimal Coupon Usage Plan:** A clear list of coupons used and detailed calculations showing how the discount was derived.
- * **Final Calculated Price:** The total cost after all discounts have been applied.
- * **Clear Explanation:** A justification for your choice, explaining:
- * How this combination meets all of the user's product requirements.
- * How it achieves the lowest possible price through strategic product selection and coupon

application.
