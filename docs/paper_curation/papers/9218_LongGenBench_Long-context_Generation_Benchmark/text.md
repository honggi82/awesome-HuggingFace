### Abstract

Current long-context benchmarks primarily focus on retrieval-based tests, requiring Large Language Models (LLMs) to locate specific information within extensive input contexts, such as the needle-in-a-haystack (NIAH) benchmark. Long-context generation refers to the ability of a language model to generate coherent and contextually accurate text that spans across lengthy passages or documents. While recent studies show strong performance on NIAH and other retrieval-based long-context benchmarks, there is a significant lack of benchmarks for evaluating long-context generation capabilities. To bridge this gap and offer a comprehensive assessment, we introduce a synthetic benchmark, LongGenBench, which is designed to evaluate the long-context generation capabilities of large language models (LLMs), with a particular focus on consistency in logical flow. LongGenBench redesigning the format of questions and necessitating that LLMs respond with a single, cohesive long-context answer. Upon extensive evaluation using LongGenBench, we observe that: (1) both API accessed and open source models exhibit performance degradation in long-context generation scenarios, ranging from 1.2% to 47.1%; (2) different series of LLMs exhibit varying trends of performance degradation, with the GEMINI1.5-FLASH model showing the least degradation among API accessed models, and the QWEN2 series exhibiting the least degradation in LongGenBench among open source models. The code is available at https://github. com/Dominic789654/LongGenBench.

and documents, sometimes spanning tens of thousands of tokens (Raffel et al., 2020; Brown et al., 2020; Chowdhery et al., 2022; Tay et al., 2022; Touvron et al., 2023; Tang et al., 2023; Zhang et al.,

- 2023). Recent advances in long-context technology in ML system field (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2024; Jacobs et al., 2023; Xiao et al., 2024) and model architecture design (Chen et al., 2023a; Xiong et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023b; Peng et al., 2024; Dong et al., 2024) have significantly improved the ability of LLMs to process increasingly large input context lengths (Liu et al., 2024a; Young et al.,
- 2024), such as Gemini-1.5-pro model can handle the 1,500-page document (Reid et al., 2024). Although previous studies (AI21, 2024; X.AI, 2024; Reid et al., 2024; Anthropic, 2024; DeepSeek-AI,

2024) often employ synthetic tasks like passkey retrieval (Mohtashami and Jaggi, 2023) and needlein-a-haystack (NIAH) (Kamradt, 2023) to evaluate the long-context capability of these LLMs, such tasks primarily test retrieval skills and do not fully assess other aspects of long-context generation.

Long-context generation refers to the ability of a language model to generate coherent and contextually accurate text that spans across a lengthy passage or document. This capability involves maintaining the thematic continuity, logical flow, and consistency of details over extended sequences of text, which can include multiple paragraphs, pages, or even entire documents.

To facilitate further research in this area, we propose the Long-context Generation benchmark (LongGenBench), a new benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the long-context generation capabilities of LLMs, with a particular focus on consistency in logical flow. LongGenBench synthesizes a dataset from current popular LLM benchmarks, redesigns the input format, and includes multiple questions within a single query. The LongGenBench requires LLMs to generate a comprehensive long-context response that sequentially addresses each question. To achieve better performance in LongGenBench, LLMs need to maintain consistency regardless of whether the previous generation part is correct or incorrect. In LongGenBench, evaluating the quality of these long-context responses is straightforward: simply compare the generated answers with the ground truth.

Our study evaluates the performance of various language models using the LongGenBench approach across different datasets, specifically LongGenBench-MMLU, LongGenBench-GSM8K, and LongGenBench-CSQA. Figure 1 displays the performance of four powerful API accessed models tested in both the baseline scenario, which involves single-answer generation, and the LongGenBench scenario, which focuses on long-context generation. It is notable that the Gemini-1.5-Flash model exhibits the lowest performance degradation in long-context generation tasks, surpassing the GPT-4o. Additionally, we conducted analyses on open-source models, revealing a general correlation between baseline performance and LongGenBench performance. Models with higher baseline scores tend to show smaller declines in longcontext generation tasks. Models like Qwen272B-Instruct and DeepSeek-v2-Chat, both with high baseline scores, also exhibit minimal perfor-

mance degradation. However, there are exceptions, such as LLaMA-3-70B-Instruct, which, despite its high baseline performance, experiences significant performance drops. Moreover, model size influences performance, as larger models within the same series, such as the LLaMA-3 and Qwen2 series, demonstrate smaller declines. Different architectures show varying trends in performance degradation; for example, LLaMA3-8B-Instruct shows a performance degradation of 47.1% on GSM8K, while ChatGLM4-9B-Chat only experiences a 10.8% drop, despite having similar baseline performances. Consistency across tasks is observed, with models like LLaMA-3-8BInstruct consistently showing significant drops on all datasets, whereas models such as Qwen2-72BInstruct and DeepSeek-v2-Chat maintain minimal declines across all datasets, underscoring their resilience in long-context generation tasks. These findings highlight the varying capabilities of different models to maintain accuracy over extended text generation and provide valuable insights for future model development and optimization. Our contributions are as follows:

- • We introduce LongGenBench, an effective approach for evaluating the long-context generation capabilities of language models across multiple datasets.
- • We provide a comprehensive performance comparison between API accessed and open source models under the LongGenBench framework, revealing insights into how different models handle long-context generation tasks.
- • Our analysis uncovers critical relationships in long-context generation tasks, including the correlation between baseline performance and LongGenBench performance, the impact of model size on performance decline, and the variation among different model architectures. Our detailed experiments establish consistent trends in performance degradation across different LongGenBench tasks, highlighting the importance of model resilience in long-context generation.

spurred the development of numerous long-context LLMs (Huang et al., 2023). Efficient attention mechanisms like Flash attention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2024) and Ring attention (Liu et al., 2023) have dramatically reduced memory demands for processing extensive contexts. Moreover, sparse attention methods, including shifted sparse attention in LongLoRA (Chen et al., 2023b), dilated attention (Ding et al., 2023), and attention sinks (Han et al., 2023; Xiao et al., 2024), further enhance long-context capabilities. For long-term memory, efficiency is achieved by caching previous contexts using recurrent mechanisms (Zhang et al., 2024b; Bulatov et al., 2023; Martins et al., 2022; Wu et al., 2022; Mohtashami and Jaggi, 2023). Techniques for extrapolative positional embedding include ALiBi (Press et al., 2022), xPOS (Sun et al., 2023), and RoPE (Su et al., 2024), along with their variants (Chen et al., 2023a; Xiong et al., 2023; Peng et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2024b; Ding et al., 2024; Zhu et al.,

models (Gu et al., 2022; Fu et al., 2022; Poli et al., 2023; Fu et al., 2023a; Gu and Dao, 2023; Dao and Gu, 2024) and RWKV (Peng et al., 2023) are also being developed to effectively manage long-context inputs.

2.2 Evaluation for Long-context Language Models

Numerous investigations into long-context model benchmarks have primarily focused on retrieval and understanding tasks. In the realm of retrieval benchmarks, the datasets used are predominantly synthetic, enabling precise control over experimental conditions, such as input token length, and minimizing the influence of varied parametric knowledge from different training strategies. Recent research has extensively focused on synthetic tasks designed for retrieval (Kamradt, 2023; Mohtashami and Jaggi, 2023; Li et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2024c; Hsieh et al., 2024; Hu et al., 2024a,b; Zhang et al., 2024a), with additional studies exploring the use of long contexts for various types of reasoning (Tay et al., 2021). For understanding benchmarks, LongBench (Bai et al., 2023b) includes evaluations in a bilingual context, covering long-document ques-

- 2023). In terms of context processing, key information is retained through retrieval augmentation (Xu et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023; Tworkowski et al.,
- 2024) and prompt compression (Jiang et al., 2023). Innovative architectural designs such as state-space

tion answering, summarization, and code completion tasks. ZeroSCROLLS (Shaham et al., 2023) and L-Eval (An et al., 2023) assess a wide array of realistic natural language tasks, such as longdocument question answering and query-driven summarization. ∞-Bench (Zhang et al., 2024c) offers challenges that involve content spanning more than 100,000 tokens.

### 3 LongGenBench

We propose LongGenBench, a synthetic benchmark that is an efficient, low-cost approach focused on evaluating long-context generation in LLMs.

#### 3.1 Motivation

Traditionally, evaluating LLMs for long-context scenarios involves inputting lengthy essays into the models, followed by either retrieval or comprehension questions as depicted in Figure 2(a) and (b). The token length of these essays typically ranges from {4K, 8K, 16K, 32K, 64K, 128K}, with advanced long-context LLMs like Gemini-1.5 (Reid et al., 2024) being tested up to 1M tokens. However, these benchmarks tend to focus predominantly on the prompt tokens or input content, often neglecting the completion tokens or output content and the evaluation of performance regarding these aspects. Furthermore, traditional long-context benchmarks such as the NIAH test are costly, with a 128K NIAH test consuming 8M tokens.

Algorithm 1 Pipeline of LongGenBench Require: System Prompt S, Questions Q, Num-

ber of Questions K, Number of Iterations T, Language Model LLM

Ensure: Long-Context Responses R

- 1: R ← ∅
- 2: for t ← 0 to T − 1 do
- 3: Qt ← Q[t × K : (t + 1) × K]
- 4: InputPrompt ← S + concatenate(Qt)
- 5: Response ← LM.gen(InputPrompt)
- 6: ParsedResponse ← parse(Response)
- 7: R ← R ∪ {ParsedResponse}
- 8: verify(ParsedResponse,Qt)
- 9: end for
- 10: return R

#### 3.2 Problem Definition

In LongGenBench, the initial step involves redesigning the input prompt format to enable LLMs to generate long-context responses as illustrated

in Figure 2(c). We refine the system prompt and restructure the question format so that K questions are sequentially concatenated after the system prompt. Subsequently, the LLMs are expected to adhere to this redesigned prompt and produce a coherent long-context response that answers all K questions. These responses are then parsed to verify the answers to the K questions, where the LLMs must maintain both the sequence and accuracy to demonstrate improved performance in LongGenBench. This process is repeated for T iterations to assess the robustness of the LLMs’ long-context generation capabilities at each length, with each iteration featuring unique questions.

The Algorithm 1 gives a pseudocode outline for the LongGenBench. The system prompt S contains instructional information, while Q is a list of questions from the original dataset. For each iteration t, a batch of K questions, Qt, is selected from Q within the range [t×K : (t+1)×K]. The selected questions are concatenated to the system

- S to form the InputPrompt. The language model LLM generates a long-context response for the given InputPrompt. The response is added to the response set R, then parsed and verified for correctness and sequence. This process is repeated for
- T iterations, with each iteration featuring a unique set of questions. The final output is the set of longcontext responses R.

During the generation process, LLMs may accumulate correct or incorrect reasoning steps, which fall within the scope of LongGenBench’s evaluation. These models might generate errors during a single long-context session, and earlier mistakes can influence subsequent outputs. Assessing a model’s performance in generating long texts involves evaluating how effectively it manages and mitigates these accumulated errors, and maintains consistency in logical flow. LongGenBench addresses this challenge by requiring models to handle and correct the impact of previous mistakes within a single long-context generation.

The conditional probability that the LLM generates the next token, given the prompt and the previously generated outputs, can be represented as:

P(xi+1 | InputPrompt,x1,x2,...,xi)

Where x1,x2,...,xi are the tokens generated in LongGenBench, the LLMs are required to produce the output based on the InputPrompt and all previously generated tokens.

#### 3.3 Dataset Construction

LongGenBench synthesizes three datasets from different domains: World Knowledge from MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2021), Arithmetic from GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021), and Commonsense Reasoning from CommonSenseQA (Talmor et al., 2019). The MMLU dataset measures a model’s ability to understand and reason across 57 diverse categories, using accuracy as the primary evaluation metric. The GSM8K dataset evaluates arithmetic problem-solving skills through 8,000 gradeschool level math word problems, using the solving rate as the main metric. CommonSenseQA tests commonsense reasoning with multiple-choice questions based on ConceptNet, with accuracy as the evaluation metric. Appendix A.3 provides details on how the synthesis process occurs.

#### 4.1 Models and Inference setup

We evaluated multiple LLMs using LongGenBench, categorizing them into API accessed models and open-source models. For API accessed models, we selected GPT-3.5-Turbo (Ouyang et al., 2022; Brown et al., 2020), GPT-4o (OpenAI, 2024), Gemini-1.5-Flash (Reid et al., 2024), and Claude3-Haiku (Anthropic, 2024). For open-source models, our selection included LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct, LLaMA-3-70B-Instruct (Meta, 2024), Qwen27B-Instruct, Qwen2-57B-A14B-Instruct, Qwen272B-Instruct (Bai et al., 2023a), ChatGLM4-9BChat (Zeng et al., 2022; Du et al., 2022), and DeepSeek-v2-Chat (DeepSeek-AI, 2024). The

API accessed models are configured with a specific maximum output length, which constrains the number of output tokens due to the computational resources and commercial policies of each API provider. Table 1 provides detailed statistics for each model. For open-source models, we remove the INSTRUCT or CHAT suffix. The prompt settings and datasets follow the guidelines from the Chainof-Thought (Wei et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022; Diao et al., 2024; Fu et al., 2023b; Pan et al., 2024), and API model access is provided through the official website. We assessed all open-source models using the vLLM framework (Kwon et al., 2023), which offers efficient KV cache memory management and a Flash attention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2024) backend. All open source models run on RTX4090 and RTX A6000 servers.

#### 4.2 Task configurations

LongGenBench generates results for three datasets, designated as LongGenBench-MMLU, LongGenBench-GSM8K, and LongGenBenchCSQA. Table 2 details the configurations for the LongGenBench experiments. In this context, K represents the number of questions that the LLM must answer in a single response, while T denotes the number of iterations, also known as query times. The total number of questions addressed is calculated using the formula K × T. To better compare the long-context generation capabilities between API accessed models and open source models, the maximum output length is uniformly set at 4096 tokens in the main experiments. For LongGenBench-MMLU, the T value is considered based on the number of categories. Categories with excessively long input prompts are excluded. In our main experiment, we arrange the questions in ascending order based on their length, setting the order within a single query from the shortest to the longest length. A detailed ablation study of this variant is discussed in Section 6.

Notably, GPT-3.5-Turbo and Claude-3-Haiku exhibit the largest Delta on both LongGenBench-MMLU and LongGenBench-GSM8K, indicating significant challenges in managing long-context generation. Conversely, the Gemini-1.5-Flash model exhibits the smallest performance degradation, suggesting greater robustness and enhanced consistency in handling long-context scenarios.

The results indicate that all models experience a decline in accuracy as the question index increases. Notably, GPT-3.5-Turbo and Claude-3-Haiku show a more significant decline, suggesting that these models struggle more with maintaining high accuracy over longer sequences of questions. In contrast, Gemini-1.5-Flash maintains relatively higher accuracy, indicating better robustness in handling long-text generation tasks.

#### 5.2 Open Source Models

The results presented in Table 4 provide a comparative analysis of the performance of various opensource models on the GSM8K and MMLU datasets under baseline conditions and using the LongGenBench approach. Several key observations can be made from these results:

Correlation Between Baseline and LongGenBench: There appears to be a general correlation between the baseline performance and the degree of performance degradation observed with the LongGenBench approach. Models with higher baseline performance tend to exhibit smaller performance drops. For example, Qwen2-72B-Instruct and DeepSeek-v2-Chat models, which have high baseline scores, show relatively small Delta values across both datasets. However, there are exceptions, such as LLaMA-3-70B-Instruct, which despite its high baseline performance, exhibits a significant performance drop on both datasets. Additionally, LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct, Qwen2-57B-Instruct, and ChatGLM4-9B-Chat models have the same baseline score on GSM8K, yet their Delta values differ substantially (47.1%, 8.4%, and 10.8%, respec-

tively).

Impact of Model Size on Performance Degradation: Observing models within the same series but with different sizes, such as the LLaMA-3 series and the Qwen2 series, reveals a trend where larger models generally exhibit smaller Delta values. This suggests that increasing model size can mitigate performance degradation in long-context generation tasks. For instance, within the LLaMA3 series, LLaMA-3-70B-Instruct shows a much smaller Delta compared to LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct across both datasets.

Variation Among Different Model Architectures: Different model architectures demonstrate varying trends in performance degradation. For models within the 7 ∼ 9B parameter range, such as LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct, Qwen2-7B-Instruct, and ChatGLM4-9B-Chat, there are notable differences in Delta values despite similar baseline performances. For example, LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct has a Delta of 47.1% on GSM8K, while ChatGLM4-9BChat has a Delta of only 10.8%, indicating significant variation in how different architectures handle long-context generation tasks.

Consistency Across Tasks for Individual Models: Individual models exhibit consistent trends in performance degradation across different LongGenBench tasks. For instance, LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct consistently shows the largest Delta values on both datasets, indicating a significant drop in perfor-

mance when generating long-context responses. Conversely, Qwen2-72B-Instruct and DeepSeekv2-Chat consistently show minimal Delta values, suggesting better resilience in long-context tasks.

These findings underscore the importance of considering both model architecture and size when evaluating the performance of LLMs in longcontext generation tasks. The LongGenBench approach effectively highlights the varying capabilities of different models to maintain accuracy over extended text generation, providing valuable insights for further model development and optimization.

Figure 4 illustrates the accuracy distribution of open-source models in LongGenBench-GSM8K. The results indicate that all models exhibit a decline in accuracy as the question index increases. Notably, LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct experiences more significant performance degradation, suggesting that this model struggles more with maintaining high accuracy in long-context generation tasks.

dering of K questions within a single query. For reconstructive processing, we compared the baseline format with the LongGenBench format. The baseline format follows the CoT (Wei et al., 2022) setting, featuring eight question-answer pairs in sequence. In contrast, the LongGenBench format presents eight questions in advance followed by the corresponding eight answers, with the K questions being addressed subsequently. Regarding the order of K questions, we evaluated three sequences: the original order from the dataset, ascending order from shortest to longest, and descending order from longest to shortest. This ablation study was performed using GPT-3.5-Turbo and Gemini-1.5Flash on the GSM8k dataset, with the number of iterations set at T = 20. Table 5 presents the results of this hyperparameter ablation study, demonstrating that both hyperparameters are crucial for LongGenBench to effectively evaluate the longcontext generation capabilities of LLMs.

Evaluating Long Input Comprehension To address the potential concern that performance

degradation in LongGenBench may be due to the model’s inability to comprehend long inputs rather than its ability to generate long outputs, we conducted additional experiments. Specifically, we designed a set of experiments where the model is provided with a long input containing multiple questions but is required to answer only one specified question at a time. This "long input + short output" setting helps isolate the model’s comprehension ability from its generation capacity.

For this experiment, we again used GPT-3.5Turbo and Gemini-1.5-Flash on the GSM8k dataset. We provided the models with a long input sequence of K questions but instructed them to respond to only one randomly selected question per query. This setup was repeated for T = 20 iterations to ensure robust evaluation.The results, shown in Table

- 6, indicate that both models maintain high accuracy when required to produce short outputs from long inputs. This supports the hypothesis that the primary challenge in LongGenBench lies in the generation of long outputs rather than comprehension of long inputs.

- 7 Conclusion

In this study, we introduced LongGenBench, an effective framework designed to evaluate the longcontext generation capabilities of language models (LLMs) across multiple datasets. Our experiments included both API accessed and open source models, offering a comprehensive comparison of their performance in long-context generation tasks. The results indicate a correlation between baseline performance and LongGenBench performance, with higher baseline models generally exhibiting smaller declines. Additionally, model size and architecture significantly influence resilience, with larger models and specific architectures demonstrating greater robustness and consistent trends across different LongGenBench tasks. These findings highlight the importance of considering both model architecture and size when evaluating LLMs in long-context generation tasks. The LongGenBench framework

effectively showcases the varying capabilities of different models, providing valuable insights for further model development and optimization.

### 8 Limitations

Our study has several limitations. Firstly, the experiments were conducted on a limited set of models and datasets, which may not fully represent the diversity of available LLMs and tasks. Secondly, we did not explore experiments with larger K values due to constraints on the maximum output tokens imposed by API accessed models. Lastly, we did not include experiments with long-context techniques, which may help mitigate the observed performance degradation. These limitations suggest that further research is needed to generalize our findings across a broader range of models and more extended context scenarios.

### A Experiment Setup and Hyperparameters

#### A.1 Baseline Setting

The baseline scores referenced in section 5 are derived from official reports to ensure the use of the highest available baseline scores.

#### A.2 Dataset

The statistics of the datasets used in our study are reported in Table 7.

DATASET # TRAIN # TEST GSM8K (COBBE ET AL., 2021) 7,473 1,319 MMLU (HENDRYCKS ET AL., 2021) - 14,079 CSQA* (TALMOR ET AL., 2019) 9,741 1,221

- Table 7: The statistics of datasets. # TRAIN and # TEST denote the number of training and test samples respectively. *: CSQA do not have publicly available test set labels, so we simply follow the setting by (Wei et al.,

2022) to evaluate the performance of the development set.

- Table 8 below compares the number of instances

in LongGenBench with other long-text benchmarks, demonstrating that LongGenBench has a comparable data size in the long-context benchmark field.

Table 8: Comparison of the number of test instances in LongGenBench with other long-text benchmarks, demonstrating that LongGenBench has a comparable data size in the long-context benchmark field.

#### A.3 LongGenBench Format

- Table 12 compares the baseline method with the LongGenBench approach in terms of chat templates used for model interactions. In the baseline method, the system prompt is followed by a series of chain-of-thought (CoT) questions and answers, ending with a real question. In contrast, the LongGenBench approach involves concatenating multiple Chain of Thought (CoT) questions and answers, followed by several real questions, to prompt the model for long-context responses. This

method helps evaluate the model’s ability to generate coherent and accurate long-context answers across a series of related questions. Additionally, it is easily adaptable to existing benchmarks, allowing for more comprehensive assessments of longcontext generation capabilities.

Table 9 presents the system prompt for LongGenBench, which is designed to be straightforward, guiding the LLM to answer each question sequentially.

#### A.4 API Models

In our experiments, we utilized specific versions of various API accessed models to evaluate their performance on LongGenBench. Table 10 provides the details of the models and their respective versions used in our study.

These versions were selected based on their availability and state-of-the-art performance at the time of experimentation. Each model was tested using the LongGenBench framework to assess their capabilities in handling long-context generation tasks. The results presented in this paper reflect the performance of these specific versions, providing a comprehensive comparison across different models and their configurations.

B Additional Experiments

#### B.1 API Accessed Models

Figure 6 and Table 11 present the generation accuracy distribution for API accessed models in LongGenBench-MMLU and LongGenBenchCSQA. The x-axis represents the question index within a single long-text response, with the maximum index being K. The y-axis indicates the accuracy of the model’s responses to these questions. The analysis demonstrates how the accuracy varies across different questions for models like GPT-3.5-Turbo, GPT-4o, Gemini-1.5-Flash, and Claude-3-Haiku when they are required to generate answers for K questions simultaneously. The results reveal that all models experience a decline in accuracy as the question index increases, with GPT-3.5-Turbo and Claude-3-Haiku showing more significant declines. Conversely, Gemini-1.5-Flash and GPT-4o maintains relatively higher accuracy, indicating better robustness in handling long-text generation tasks. Since these models do not provide official results for CSQA, we use our replicated baseline score.

LongGenBench System Prompt Exemplars

Answer each question step by step, adhering to the format shown in the examples provided. Start each response with ’Answer_’ and introduce the final response with ’The answer is’. Do not repeat the question. Ensure that you respond to all the questions presented, regardless of their number.

Figure 6: Generation accuracy distribution of API accessed models in LongGenBench-MMLU and LongGenBench-CSQA.

In addition to the main experiments, we conducted an extended evaluation using the Gemini1.5-Flash model, which supports a longer maximum output length 8K tokens. For this extended

evaluation, we set the value of K in the range 40,50,60,70,80,90 and fixed the number of iterations T at 10. This allowed us to investigate the impact of larger K values on model performance in the LongGenBench-GSM8K experiment. Figure 7 shows the performance scores as K increases from 40 to 90, with the number of iterations T set to 10. A red dashed line indicates the baseline score of 86.2 for comparison.

B.2 Open Source Model

###### Figure 8 and Table 13 illustrates the generation accuracy distribution for open source models in LongGenBench-MMLU and LongGenBenchCSQA. Similar to the API accessed models, the x-axis represents the question index, and the yaxis represents the accuracy of responses. The results indicate that all open source models exhibit a decline in accuracy as the question index increases. Notably, LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct experiences significant performance degradation, suggesting that this model struggles with maintaining high accuracy in long-context generation tasks. In contrast, larger models such as LLaMA-3-70B-Instruct and Qwen2-72B-Instruct demonstrate greater resilience, maintaining higher accuracy across longer sequences of questions. Since these models do

#### B.3 Cost

In this section, we compare the costs between the Needle-In-A-Haystack (NIAH) test and LongGenBench. For NIAH, costs are calculated for a 128K token test. For LongGenBench, calculations are based on the same K and T values used in the GPT-4o configuration, as specified in Table 2, and applied across the datasets LongGenBench-GSM8K, LongGenBench-MMLU, and LongGenBench-CSQA. The pricing is based on the GPT-4o rates, which are $5 per million input tokens and $15 per million output tokens.

As shown in Table 14, the NIAH test incurs a significantly higher cost compared to LongGenBench. Specifically, the NIAH test requires 8192K input tokens and 0.1K output tokens, resulting in a total cost of $40. In contrast, LongGenBench requires 300K input tokens and 340K output tokens, resulting in a much lower total cost of $6.6.

### C Exemplars Generated by LLMs Using LongGenBench

Tables 15 and 16 provide examples of responses generated by LLMs using LongGenBench, where each model generated K answers in a single longcontext response. These examples demonstrate that the models can remember the content and sequence of the K questions and maintain consistency in logical flow during generation.

### D Licenses

For the evaluation dataset, all the datasets, including GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021), MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2021), CSQA (Talmor et al., 2019) are released under MIT license.

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days, he eats 30 ∗ 2 = 60 yogurts. Since yogurts are on sale at 4 for $5.00, he spends 60/4 ∗ $5.00 = $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days.

[Figure 16]

- Answer_2: There are 25 oranges in total, and 20% of them are unripe, so 20% of 25 is 0.20 ∗ 25 = 5. 1 is bad and 2 are sour, so from 25 − (1 + 2 + 5) = 25 − 8 = 17 Therefore, 17 oranges are good.

[Figure 17]

- Answer_3: There are 6 clusters with 6 ∗ 20 = 120 raspberries. Together with the 67 individual fruit, there are 120 + 67 = 187 raspberries in total.

[Figure 18]

- Answer_4: Lloyd produces 252 eggs per day, so in a week, he produces 252 * 7 = 1764 eggs. He sells them for $2 per dozen, so he sells 1764/12 = 147 dozens per week. Therefore, his weekly income from eggs is 147 ∗ $2 = $294.

[Figure 19]

- Answer_5: If there are twice as many boys as girls in the school and there are 60 girls, then there are 2 ∗ 60 = 120 boys. With 5 students to every teacher, there are 60 + 120 = 180 students. Therefore, there are 180 / 5 = 36 teachers.

[Figure 20]

......

- Answer_24: Each school sent 2 teams with 5 players and 2 coaches, so each school sent 2 ∗ (5 + 2) = 14 people. With 4 schools, there are therefore 4 ∗ 14 = 56 people in total.

[Figure 21]

- Answer_25: If Dana spends 1/3 of 6 hours running, she runs 1/3 ∗ 6 = 2 hours. She travels at a rate of 3 ∗ 2 = 6 miles per hour. If she spends 2/3 of 6 hours walking, she walks 2/3 ∗ 6 = 4 hours. She travels at 1/4 ∗ 3 = 0.75 miles per hour, so she walks 4 ∗ 0.75 = 3 miles. In total, she travels 2 ∗ 6 + 4 ∗ 3 = 12 + 12 = 24 miles in 6 hours.

[Figure 22]

- Answer_26: The final price of Stephen’s groceries is 25% + $3.00 + $4.00 = $13.00 more than $40.00, so the final price is $40.00 + $13.00 = $53.00.

[Figure 23]

- Answer_27: In the first half of the year, Aleena pays $140 ∗ 6 = $840. After the discount, in the second half of the year, she pays 10% ∗ $140 ∗ 6 = $84 less, so she pays $840 − $84 = $756. Thus, the total amount she paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is $840 + $756 = $1596.

[Figure 24]

- Answer_28: The truck and driver weigh 3755 pounds, leaving a maximum capacity of 5000 − 3755 = 1245 pounds. So up to 1245/15 = 83 boxes can be loaded onto the truck.

[Figure 25]

- Answer_32: Sophia travels 100 miles on 4 gallons of gas, so she uses 100/4 = 25 miles per gallon. On one tank of 12 gallons, she will be able to drive 25 ∗ 12 = 300 miles.

[Figure 26]

- Answer_33: For repairing 6 truck tires, the revenue is 6 ∗ $60 = $360. For repairing 4 car tires, the revenue is 4 ∗ $40 = $160. The difference in revenue is $360 − $160 = $200 more.

[Figure 27]

- Answer_34: Meredith spent 4 hours on each blog article, so 5 articles took 5 ∗ 4 = 20 hours on Monday. On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 more articles, which is 2/5∗5 = 2, making a total of 5+2 = 7 articles. Then on Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles as on Tuesday, so 7∗2 = 14 articles. All in all, Meredith spent 20+(7∗4)+(14∗4) = 20+28+56 = 104 hours writing articles in the three days.

[Figure 28]

- Answer_35: If Polly holds the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the gold javelin three times as far, so she can throw it 400∗3 = 1200 feet. Therefore, holding the sapphire gemstone, she can stand 1200 − 1000 = 200 feet outside the reach of the dragon’s flames and still hit the dragon.

Let’s think step by step. Bubblesort has O(n2) running time in both worst and average cases. Mergesort has O(nlogn) running time in both worst and average cases. Heapsort has O(nlogn) running time in both worst and average cases. Quicksort has O(n2) running time in the worst case and O(nlogn) running time on average. The answer is (D).

[Figure 30]

- Answer_2: Let’s think step by step. Insertion sort is heavily dependent on the initial ordering of the input. Quicksort is heavily dependent on the initial ordering of the input. Merge sort is least dependent on the initial ordering of the input, because its performance is consistent regardless of the ordering of the input. Selection sort is also heavily dependent on the initial ordering of the input. The answer is (C).

[Figure 31]

- Answer_3: Let’s think step by step. We can think of a K-ary tree as being composed of one nonterminal root node, K nonterminal child nodes of the root, K2 nonterminal child nodes of each of those nodes, etc. Thus, a K-ary tree of depth N is composed of: 1+K +K2 +....+KN nonterminal nodes and (KN −1)/(K −1) total nodes. As the depth of the tree increases, the proportion of nonterminal nodes relative to the total number of nodes approaches: (1 + K + K2 + .... + KN)/((KN −1)/(K −1)) = ((K(N +1)−1)/(K −1))/((KN −1)/(K −1)) = (K(N +1)−1)/(KN −1) = (K(N + 1) − 1)/(KN − 1) ∗ (K/K) = (K(N + 2) − K)/(K(N + 1) − K) = (K(N + 1) − 1)/(KN − 1) + 1 = (1 + K + K2 + .... + K(N + 1))/(1 + K + K2 + .... + KN) which as N increases approaches: K/(K − 1). The answer is (B).

[Figure 32]

- Answer_4: Let’s think step by step. We can see that {AND, OR} is not complete because we cannot express NOT. We can see that {AND, NOT} and {NOT, OR} are both complete. We can also see that {NAND} is complete because NAND can express all other boolean operations. The answer is (C).

- Answer_19: Let’s think step by step. The IP protocol is primarily concerned with routing packets through the network. It defines the format of packets and the addressing scheme used to route packets between different networks. The answer is (A).

[Figure 34]

- Answer_20: Let’s think step by step. TCP protocol is responsible for reliable delivery of large (multi-packet) messages between machines that are not necessarily directly connected. It provides a reliable connection-oriented service, ensuring that packets arrive in the correct order and are not lost. The answer is (C).

[Figure 35]

- Answer_21: Let’s think step by step. A common divisor must divide both integers. The set of common divisors of two integers is a subset of the divisors of each integer. Thus, the set {-6,-2, -1, 1, 2, 6} could possibly be the set of all common divisors of two integers. The answer is (A).

[Figure 36]

......

- Answer_38: Let’s think step by step. If the owner is allowed to delete a file, dangling links may result. This is true, because if the owner deletes the file, the link count in the shared file node will be decremented. However, the links to the file in other users’ directories will still point to the shared file node. If the owner deletes the file, these links will become dangling links. The answer is (C).

[Figure 37]

- Answer_39: Let’s think step by step. Giving priorities to processes and ordering the wait queues by priority will not deal effectively with the problem of deadlock. This is because deadlock can occur even if processes have priorities and wait queues are ordered by priority. For example, consider a system with two processes, P1 and P2, and two resources, R1 and R2. P1 holds R1 and requests R2, while P2 holds R2 and requests R1. Deadlock will occur even if P1 has a higher priority than P2. The answer is (A).

[Figure 38]

- Answer_40: Let’s think step by step. Indirect representation noticeably increases compilation time. This is false, because indirect representation does not noticeably increase compilation time. Direct representation decreases the time needed to access components of a variable. This is true, because direct representation allows for faster access to components of a variable, as the compiler does not need to dereference a pointer to access the components. When the storage size of some private component of a variable changes, indirect representation minimizes the number of recompilations of source modules that must be performed. This is true, because indirect representation allows for changes to the size of private components without requiring recompilation of source modules that use the variable. The answer is (D).
