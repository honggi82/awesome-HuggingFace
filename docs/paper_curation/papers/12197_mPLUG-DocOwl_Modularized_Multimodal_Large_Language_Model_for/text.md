#### Abstract

Document understanding refers to automatically extract, analyze and comprehend information from various types of digital documents, such as a web page. Existing Multi-model Large Language Models (MLLMs), including mPLUG-Owl, have demonstrated promising zero-shot capabilities in shallow OCR-free text recognition, indicating their potential for OCR-free document understanding. Nevertheless, without in-domain training, these models tend to ignore fine-grained OCR features, such as sophisticated tables or large blocks of text, which are essential for OCR-free document understanding. In this paper, we propose mPLUG-DocOwl based on mPLUG-Owl for OCR-free document understanding. Specifically, we first construct a instruction tuning dataset featuring a wide range of visual-text understanding tasks. Then, we strengthen the OCR-free document understanding ability by jointly train the model on language-only, general vision-and-language, and document instruction tuning dataset with our unified instruction tuning strategy. We also build an OCR-free document instruction understanding evaluation set LLMDoc to better compare models’ capabilities on instruct compliance and document understanding. Experimental results show that our model outperforms existing multi-modal models, demonstrating its strong ability of document understanding. Besides, without specific fine-tuning, mPLUG-DocOwl generalizes well on various downstream tasks. Our code, models, training data and evaluation set are available at https://github.com/X-PLUG/mPLUG-DocOwl.

#### 1 Introduction

Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT [OpenAI, 2022], BLOOM [Scao et al., 2022], and LLaMA [Touvron et al., 2023] have undergone rapid development to enable the realization of general artificial intelligence, boasting impressive zero-shot capabilities across diverse linguistic applications. With the LLM as the language decoder, Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) such as MiniGPT-4 [Zhu et al., 2023], LLaVA [Liu et al., 2023a], and mPLUG-Owl [Ye et al., 2023] have demonstrated remarkable zero-shot performance in various open-ended vision-and-language tasks. These models are trained to align text and images during the pre-training phase, and then to promote diverse abilities during the instruction tuning phase. Interestingly, these MLLMs exhibit superficial OCR-free text recognition abilities without explicit training on visual text understanding datasets [Ye et al., 2023, Liu et al., 2023b]. Nevertheless, due to lacking specific training, these models still face the challenge of comprehending intricate relationships between visual text and objects in diverse types of images, such as charts, documents and webpages.

By performing unified instruction tuning for Document Understanding upon the mPLUG-Owl [Ye et al., 2023], we further propose a modularized MLLM [Li et al., 2022, Xu et al., 2023b], namely mPLUG-DocOwl. Our approach utilizes a modularized framework similar to mPLUG-Owl [Ye et al., 2023], which incorporates a visual abstractor module to link a pre-trained LLM with a visual knowledge module, achieving the alignment of text and images. To enhance diverse document understanding capabilities, we reorganize various downstream document understanding tasks in the same form of instructions. To maintain general uni/multi-modal abilities, we also include language-only and general vision-and-language instruction datasets used by mPLUG-Owl to train the mPLUG-DocOwl. During training, both the visual knowledge module and LLM decoder are frozen, only the visual abstractor and the Low-Rank Adaption (LoRA) [Hu et al., 2022] in LLM are fine-tuned.

mPLUG-DocOwl achieves ocr-free state-of-the-art performance on multiple commonly used document understanding datasets. Furthermore, our experiments on a carefully-built document instruction understanding evaluation set LLMDoc shows that mPLUG-DocOwl achieves significantly better visual text understanding performance on various domains than existing MLMMs.

Our main contributions can be highlighted as follows:

- • We propose a modularized MLLM, mPLUG-DocOwl, which is the first one to balance language-only, general vision-and-language, and document understanding based on unified instruction tuning.
- • We carefully construct an instruction understanding test set with human evaluation, dubbed LLMDoc, to assess diverse document understanding capabilities.
- • Empirical results demonstrate that our mPLUG-DocOwl surpasses existing methods on ocr-free document understanding, including multiple standard benchmarks and LLMDoc.

#### 2 Related Work

##### 2.1 Visual Text Understanding

There are two types of models for understanding images that contain rich textual information. The first kind of approaches [Xu et al., 2020, Huang et al., 2022, Hu et al., 2021, Tang et al., 2023, Yang et al., 2021] utilize off-the-shelf OCR models or APIs to recognize text from images, and then design pretraining tasks to facilitate cross-modality alignment between visual and textual inputs. On the other hand, end-to-end approaches [Davis et al., 2022, Kim et al., 2022, Lee et al., 2022] utilize a high-resolution image encoder to learn text recognition during the pretraining stage. Both two types of models rely on specific finetuning on different downstream datasets and can’t achieve open-domain instruction understanding performance like Multimodal Large Language Models.

##### 2.2 Multimodal Large Language Model

Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive zero-shot abilities across various open-ended tasks. Recent research has also explored the application of LLMs for multi-modal generation, utilizing two different paradigms: systematic collaboration and end-to-end trained models. Systematic collaboration approaches, such as Visual ChatGPT [Wu et al., 2023] and MM-REACT [Yang et al., 2023], leverage various vision experts or tools to express visual information with text descriptions. Subsequently, LLMs, such as ChatGPT [OpenAI, 2022], can act as agents and select appropriate experts and tools for visual understanding. Finally, LLMs would summarize the output of these experts to answer user queries. On the other hand, some approaches, such as MiniGPT-4 [Zhu et al., 2023], LLaVA [Liu et al., 2023a], and mPLUG-Owl [Ye et al., 2023], leverage LLMs to build unified models for multi-modality with limited connected parameters. These methods show superficial OCR-free text recognition abilities under the zero-shot setting. However, for complicated document understanding, due to lacking in-domain training, they encounter challenges in handling diverse image types, recognizing rich texts and comprehending relationships between visual semantic and text information. In this work, through unified instruction tuning, mPLUG-DocOwl achieves much better document understanding performance and maintains general uni/multi-modal abilities.

#### 3 mPLUG-DocOwl

##### 3.1 Architecture

The architecture of mPLUG-DocOwl is based on a popular multi-modal language model, mPLUGOwl [Ye et al., 2023], which comprises a pre-trained visual foundation model, a visual abstractor, and a language foundation model. The visual foundation model is responsible for extracting visual features from the input images, and the visual abstractor distills these features using a set of learnable tokens. The resulting visual features are then concatenated with the word embeddings of the input sentence and fed into the language model to generate the response. This powerful architecture allows for accurate and efficient multi-modal language processing.

The mPLUG-Owl [Ye et al., 2023] exhibits superficial OCR ability when presented with images containing salient text. Inspired by this, we propose to further fine-tune the model with document instruction tuning data for better document understanding performance, covering document, table, chart and natural image and webpage. During fine-tuning, we freeze the visual encoder and the language model and train the visual abstractor. We also adopt the low-rank adaptation approach (LoRA) [Hu et al., 2022] to enhance the language model’s ability.

##### 3.2 Instruction Tuning Data

This section introduces the composition of our instruction tuning data in detail. To ensure the versatility of mPLUG-DocOwl, we collect diverse document understanding datasets with different task formats, including Visual Question Answering (VQA) [Antol et al., 2015], Information Extraction (IE), Natural Language Inference (NLI) [Bowman et al., 2015], and Image Captioning (IC). mPLUG-Owl [Ye et al., 2023] performs instruction tuning with a unified format as "<image>Human:{question} AI:{answer}". In this work, we convert different document understanding tasks to the same format as mPLUG-Owl [Ye et al., 2023] by replacing the {question} and {answer} placeholders as follows.

Visual Question Answering We simply use the raw question and answer as the {question} and {answer} placeholders. We collect VQA datasets on diverse domains, including ChartQA [Masry et al., 2022], DocVQA [Mathew et al., 2021], InfographicsVQA (InfoVQA) [Mathew et al., 2022],

WikiTableQuestions (WTQ) [Pasupat and Liang, 2015], TextVQA [Singh et al., 2019] and VisualMRC [Tanaka et al., 2021].

Information Extraction requires the model to extract key-value pairs from the input image. The ‘keys’ (or ‘categories’) are always a stationary set. To convert this task to the instruction tuning format, we treat the value as the {answer} and construct the {question} as ‘What is the value for the {key}?’. When the key does not exist in the image, the {answer} is set to ‘None’. We collect Information Extraction data from DeepForm [Svetlichnaya, 2020], and Kleister Charity (KLC) [Stanislawek et al., 2021].

Natural Language Inference is a binary classification task with labels ‘Entailed’ and ‘Refuted’. Given a statement, we construct the {question} as ‘{statement}, Yes or No?’. The {answer} is ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ and refers to ‘Entailed’ or ‘Refuted’, respectively. TabFact [Chen et al., 2020], a natural language inference dataset about tables, is chosen for instruction tuning.

Image Captioning aims to briefly describe an image with fluent language. We treat the caption as the {answer} and randomly choose a prompt as the {question} like LLaVa [Liu et al., 2023a]. TextCaps [Sidorov et al., 2020] is an appropriate captioning dataset on natural images with texts.

Language-only and General Vision-and-language Instruction Tuning. To enhance the model’s ability of language comprehension and multi-modal open-ended conversation, we follow mPLUGOwl [Ye et al., 2023] to introduce language-only and general vision-and-language instruction tuning data [Taori et al., 2023, Vicuna, 2023, Xu et al., 2023a, Liu et al., 2023a].

Figure 2 shows the composition of our instruction tuning data grouped by the dataset type. We use training sets of these datasets as instruction tuning data and evaluate models on test sets.

- 3.3 Training Details

We adopt a two-stage training paradigm, where the Vision Transformer and Language model are kept frozen. In the first stage, both the visual abstractor and LoRA [Hu et al., 2022] in the language model are fine-tuned. The first stage only uses the document understanding data and takes 10 epochs. In the second stage, we further freeze the visual abstractor and only train the LoRA. Besides document understanding data, the language-only and general vision-and-language instruction tuning data are further introduced at this stage and up-sampled 6 times. The second stage takes 3 epochs. Other training hyper-parameters are the same as mPLUG-Owl [Ye et al., 2023].

- 4 Experiment

- 4.1 LLMDoc

Existing benchmarks are hard to evaluate the open-ended instruction understanding results given by MLMMs. For better compare the instruction understanding performance in the document domain, we further construct a test set with human evaluation, namely LLMDoc.

Data Collection To comprehensively evaluate the model’s abilities, we consider five scenarios to construct our evaluation dataset, including table (TabFact [Chen et al., 2020]), chart (ChartQA [Masry et al., 2022]), document (DocVQA [Mathew et al., 2021]), natural image (TextVQA [Singh et al., 2019]) and webpage (VisualMRC [Tanaka et al., 2021]). Specifically, for each dataset, we sample 20 images from the test split. For 10 of these images, we adopt a raw question as the instruction. While for the other 10, we ask annotators to write instructions requiring stronger capabilities like summarization, inference, and calculation. In total, we obtain 100 test samples.

Human Evaluation Following the rating criteria proposed in Self-Instruct [Wang et al., 2022], we perform the human evaluation to score the model’s responses, where A > B > C > D and A represents ‘correct and satisfying response’, B means ‘acceptable response with minor imperfections’, C refers to ‘response to the instruction but has significant errors’ and D means ‘irrelevant or invalid response’.

We compare mPLUG-DocOwl with other popular mult-modal large language models, including mPLUG-Owl [Ye et al., 2023] and MiniGPT4 [Zhu et al., 2023], on LLMDoc. As shown in Figure 3, mPLUG-DocOwl achieves significantly better performance, with 37 responses being scored as “A”, demonstrating the stronger understanding ability of mPLUGDocOwl in diverse document scenarios. Besides, it’s worth noting that all models have some responses scored as “C” or “D”, showing that instruction understanding performance in the document domain is still far from promising and needs more endeavor.

[Figure 8]

##### 4.2 Benchmark Evaluation

Besides human evaluation, we also compare our mPLUG-DocOwl with ocr-free state-ofthe-art document understanding models on public datasets. Table 1 shows the comparison with Dessurt [Davis et al., 2022], Donut [Kim et al., 2022] and Pix2Struct [Lee et al., 2022] on DUE-Benchmark [Borchmann et al., 2021], which mainly requires the text recognition and layout understanding abilities on documents and tables. Besides, Table 2 presents the evaluation on the chart, natural image and webpage datasets, which ask stronger ability to relate visual semantics and text information. Without finetuning on each dataset, our mPLUG-DocOwl achieves comparable or even better performance.

LLMDoc Results Figure 5 and Figure 6 present the comparison between mPLUG-DocOwl and Mini-GPT4 on LLMDoc. Figure 5 (a) requires models to convert a table into JSON format. Our mPLUG-DocOwl correctly understands the instruction and return a string in JSON format, but misses the last row. Mini-GPT4 fails to comprehend the instruction and doesn’t understand the content within the table. In Figure 5 (b), both mPLUG-DocOwl and Mini-GPT4 correctly recognize the name of the shop. However, Mini-GPT4 overlooks a smaller sign indicating clothes in this shop are medical uniforms. As for chart understanding in Figure 6 (c), Mini-GPT4 gives a wrong answer and redundant response, while our mPLUG-DocOwl gives a concise and correct response. In Figure 6 (d), Bernadette’s actual purpose is to confirm with Suzy if she would like to have the copy sent overnight. This not only requires the model to accurately recognize the text, but also to understand the relationships between involved persons. mPLUG-DocOwl recognizes the phrase "request a copy of chapter," but misunderstands the subject and object. Mini-GPT4 only comprehends that this image is a mail scenario and provides a vague and hallucinatory response. In Figure 6 (e), mPLUG-DocOwl gives a correct summary of the two latest news but Mini-GPT4 generates news irrelevant to the webpage screenshot.

- Figure 7 and Figure 8 show some wrong responses given by mPLUG-DocOwl. In Figure 7 (a), mPLUG-DocOwl only takes note of the three names in the picture, but ignores the fact that the user itself is also a speaker. In Figure 7 (b), mPLUG-DocOwl fails to perform multi-step calculations on multiple elements in the image. In Figure 8 (c), the model can understand the scene and the text in it, but fantasizes about non-existent characters. In Figure 8 (d), mPLUG-DocOwl fails to understand the instruction for writing news and only read the texts in the tablet.

#### 5 Conclusion

In this work, we infuse diverse ocr-free document understanding capabilities into mPLUG-Owl by incorporating document understanding data into instruction finetuning. Experiment results demonstrate that our mPLUG-DocOwl achieves comparable or even better performance than existing OCRfree methods. Besides, benefiting from language-only and general vision-and-language instruction tuning, mPLUG-DocOwl can better comprehend user instructions and intentions, enabling more complex interactions. Moreover, human evaluation on LLMDoc reveals that mPLUG-DocOwl still struggles with document-related commonsense reasoning, mathematical calculations, and creative generation. This provides valuable insights about developing stronger document understanding abilities with the LLM in the future.

Human: What kind of scene do the words in the picture convey? mPLUG-DocOwl: The words in the picture convey a comic book or cartoon-like scene, with a character saying "K-Rash" and "Sploosh!" The words are accompanied by a drawing of a person, possibly a character from a comic book or cartoon, and the words are in a speech bubble. The scene appears to be a humorous or lighthearted moment, as the character is likely expressing an exaggerated or unexpected reaction to something.
