### Abstract

We introduce self-invoking code generation, a new task designed to evaluate the progressive reasoning and problem-solving capabilities of LLMs. In this task, models are presented with a base problem and a related, more complex problem. They must solve the base problem and then utilize its solution to address the more complex one. This work features three key contributions. First, we propose a general recipe for generating more challenging versions of existing benchmarks, resulting in three new benchmarks: HumanEval Pro, MBPP Pro, and BigCodeBench-Lite Pro, specifically designed to assess LLMs on self-invoking code generation. Second, from the analysis of experimental results over twenty LLMs on our benchmarks, we have two important observations: (i) Most LLMs excel in traditional code generation benchmarks like HumanEval and MBPP, but their performance declines on selfinvoking tasks. For example, o1-mini achieves 96.2% pass@1 on HumanEval but only 76.2% on HumanEval Pro. (ii) On self-invoking code generation task, the instruction-tuned models demonstrate only marginal improvements compared to the base models. Third, we disclose the types of failure modes that exist in our evaluation results. All these results underscore the need for further advancements in self-invoking code generation tasks and provide a new direction for future research on enhancing LLMs’ code reasoning capabilities.

(Chen et al., 2021) and MBPP (Austin et al., 2021) have been widely adopted to evaluate the code generation abilities of LLMs, providing standardized evaluation protocols for assessing their performance on code-related tasks. However, these existing benchmarks primarily focus on isolated, single-function code generation, which represents only a subset of the challenges encountered in realworld software development scenarios.

### 1 Introduction

Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant progress in various code-related tasks including code generation (Roziere et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023; Ni et al., 2024), program repair (Xia et al., 2022; Jin et al., 2023), and code translation (Zhu et al., 2022), etc. Traditional human-annotated benchmarks such as HumanEval

To evaluate LLMs under more realistic problemsolving scenarios, BigCodeBench (Zhuo et al., 2024) presents a benchmark that comprises of complex and practical problems requiring LLMs to use multiple function calls from diverse libraries. While BigCodeBench highlights the use of external function calls, it falls short in assessing LLMs’

reasoning ability to generate and invoke their own generated functions in problem-solving. CRUXEval (Gu et al., 2024) assesses LLMs’ code reasoning by predicting function inputs and outputs. However, the direct input and output prediction does not involve explicit code generation. In practical software engineering contexts, developers must not only write code but also comprehend, modify, and utilize existing code to solve more complex problems. Hence, the ability to understand and subsequently leverage one’s own generated code, namely self-invoking code generation (Figure 1), plays an important role for LLMs to leverage their reasoning capabilities to code generation that current benchmarks fail to capture.

Therefore, we present HumanEval Pro and MBPP Pro, two expanded versions of the traditional HumanEval and MBPP benchmarks to evaluate LLMs on self-invoking code generation task. As illustrated in Figure 1, HumanEval Pro and MBPP Pro extend beyond simple code generation by introducing self-invoking problems which requires LLMs to solve the base problem and invoke their self-generated code to solve a more complex problem. By evaluating LLMs on self-invoking code generation task, HumanEval Pro and MBPP Pro provide a useful and important probe to better understand the programming capabilities of LLMs. The capability of self-invoking code generation also facilitates LLMs to tackle difficult tasks with greater autonomy and effectiveness.

To obtain HumanEval Pro and MBPP Pro, we propose a general recipe for constructing self-invoking code generation benchmarks by building upon existing datasets. First, we use Deepseek-V2.5 (DeepSeek-AI, 2024) to generate self-invoking problems based on the original problems in HumanEval and MBPP. These problems are designed to be more complex than the base problems and closely related to them, ensuring progressive reasoning and coherent code invocation. Second, we generate the candidate solution and test inputs for each problem. Third, we execute the code of candidate solution to generate output and use the assert command in Python to build test cases. In the third stage, human experts are assigned to manually review each problem and continuously modify and execute the code of solutions to ensure that all canonical solutions could correctly solve the problem and cover the test cases. To verify the reproducibility of our benchmark construction approach, we further construct

BigCodeBench-Lite Pro, a new self-invoking problems set derived from BigCodeBench (Zhuo et al., 2024). On Bigcodebench-Lite Pro, LLMs show consistent performance trend with HumanEval Pro and MBPP Pro, which emphasizes the generalizability of our construction pipeline. Therefore, our benchmark construction approach can also be extended to adapt other code generation benchmarks, particularly as the capabilities of LLMs advance and older benchmarks become obsolete.

Through extensive evaluation of various LLMs, we uncover a significant disparity between traditional code generation and self-invoking code generation capabilities. Our findings reveal that while frontier LLMs excel at generating individual code snippets, they often struggle to effectively utilizing their own generated code for solving more complex problems. For example, o1-mini achieves 96.2% pass@1 on HumanEval but only 76.2% on HumanEval Pro, demonstrating the challenges inherent in self-invoking code generation. From the comparison between instruction-tuned models and their base models, we found that instruction-tuned models are less efficient on self-invoking code generation than traditional code generation task. Furthermore, our detailed statistics of failure cases in HumanEval Pro and MBPP Pro also reflect the shortcomings of LLMs in self-invoking code generation, thereby providing complementary insights on real-world coding capabilities of LLMs.

### 2 Related Work

Recent advances in LLMs have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in code generation and understanding. This section reviews the current landscape of code-related benchmarks and LLMs.

Benchmarks for Code Generation The evaluation landscape for Code LLMs has evolved significantly. HumanEval (Chen et al., 2021) and MBPP (Austin et al., 2021) serve as fundamental benchmarks, focusing on Python function completion tasks with test-driven evaluation. Several benchmarks have expanded code evaluation benchmarks to encompass multiple programming languages (Zheng et al., 2023; Athiwaratkun et al., 2022), complex tasks like program repair (Haque et al., 2022; Jiang et al., 2023; Muennighoff et al., 2024; Xia et al., 2024), dynamic problem sets (Jain et al., 2024), and code reasoning through code summarization (Barone and Sennrich, 2017; Hasan et al., 2021) and sim-

We summarize the entire benchmark construction process as follows: (1) Self-invoking problem Generation: We use Deepseek-V2.5 to generate the self-invoking problems, as well as their candidate solutions and test inputs. (2) Solutions Generation: We execute the generated solution with the test inputs in a controlled Python environment to obtain ground truth outputs. (3) Test Cases Generation: We employ an iterative method involving Python execution check and manual review to ensure that all test cases pass successfully. The final execution results are then used to construct complete test cases with assert command.

WizardCoder (Luo et al., 2023), Magicoder (Wei et al., 2024), WaveCoder (Yu et al., 2024), OpenCodeInterpreter (Zheng et al., 2024), and ReflectionCoder (Ren et al., 2024). These models have achieved impressive performance on standard code generation benchmarks through enhanced data diversity and instruction complexity.

- et al., 2023), and GoogleCodeRepo (Shrivastava

- et al., 2023) focus on real-world tasks, code evolution, and repository-level challenges. These benchmarks collectively drive the advancement of LLMs, providing valuable insights into their strengths and limitations. Our benchmarks introduce novel selfinvoking code generation task, which addresses gaps left by existing benchmarks. This addition provides a more holistic framework to evaluate LLMs on leveraging their reasoning capabilities to code generation. Moreover, our benchmark construction method could also push existing benchmarks forward to accommodate more complex and challenging code-related tasks.

LLMs for Code Generation The development of foundation models specifically designed for code generation has seen significant progress. CodeX (Chen et al., 2021) pioneered this direction by finetuning GPT models on code-specific data. Subsequent models like CodeGeeX (Zheng et al., 2023) and CodeLLaMA (Roziere et al., 2023) further advanced the field by incorporating multilingual code understanding and generation capabilities. StarCoder (Li et al., 2023), DeepseekCoder (Zhu

- et al., 2024) and Qwen2.5-Coder (Hui et al., 2024) demonstrated the importance of high-quality code data curation and specialized architecture designs. Building upon these models, researchers have explored instruction-tuning approaches using GPT-4 or GPT-3.5 as teachers. Notable examples include

### 3 Benchmark Construction

To facilitate a meaningful comparison between self-invoking code generation and traditional code generation, we have crafted two new benchmarks, HumanEval Pro and MBPP Pro. These benchmarks are extensions of the original HumanEval and MBPP, requiring the model to solve both the base problem and a more complex self-invoking problem. In addressing the self-invoking problems, LLMs are required to apply the solutions they have independently generated for the base problem. This evaluation of self-invoking code generation offers deeper insights into the programming capabilities of LLMs, extending beyond the scope of singleproblem code generation. The benchmark construction process, illustrated in Figure 2, will be discussed in detail in the following subsections.

#### 3.1 Self-invoking Problem Generation

To ensure that all benchmarks are permissively licensed, we employ one of the state-of-the-art (SoTA) open-source models, DeepSeek-V2.5, to create new problems and solutions derived from the original HumanEval and MBPP datasets. Two main guidelines is established for self-invoking problems generation to rigorously evaluate LLMs.

- 1) Complexity Enhancement: The self-invoking problems should introduce additional programming challenges while preserving the core functionality of the original problems. This ensures that successful solutions require both understanding of the original code and ability to extend it appropriately.
- 2) Semantic Relevance: The self-invoking problems should maintain sufficient semantic similarity to their original counterparts to enable meaningful self-invoking code generation process. Appendix F.1 presents the prompt for self-invoking problem generation.

#### 3.2 Solution Generation

In self-invoking problem generation process, the candidate solution and test inputs are generated simultaneously with the self-invoking problem. However, when dealing with self-invoking problems, these generated solutions are often flawed, which can lead to execution errors during the verification process, thereby highlighting a significant challenge in maintaining the accuracy and effectiveness of these test cases. Therefore, as shown in Figure 2, we propose a method to iteratively execute the solution code with test inputs and obtain expected outputs correctly. For the execution errors, the authors manually analyze these errors and modify the solutions to ensure that the final solution can cover all the test cases comprehensively. The manual review process involves (1) identifying the root causes of the errors, (2) making necessary adjustments to the code or algorithm, and (3) re-evaluating the solution against the entire set of test cases to confirm its correctness and completeness. Table 1 shows that our rigorous verification process ensures the high quality of our benchmarks.

#### 3.3 Test Cases Generation

After obtaining the self-invoking problem and its candidates solution, a critical challenge is ensuring the reliability of the test cases (with both test inputs and expected execution outputs) to validate the the generated solutions. Despite the apparent simplicity of using the same LLM context to generate both problems and test cases, CRUXEval (Gu

- et al., 2024) results show that even leading models like GPT-4 achieve only a 63.4% pass@1 rate in test output prediction. This suggests that using models like GPT-4 to directly generate test cases for problems will lead to many inaccurate evaluation results. Our iterative verification method effectively addresses this challenge. By combining

- Round 2 98.8 99.7

- Round 3 100.0 100.0

Table 1: Pass@1 (%) of candidate solutions across different iteration rounds for canonical solution and test case generation with human manual review.

Python execution checks with manual reviews, we ensure that all test cases accurately assess solution correctness and achieves a 100% pass@1 under correct implementation conditions. Furthermore, we categorize the common execution errors that occur during test case generation into four main types: variable type mismatches, index out of bounds, invalid input handling, and edge case failures. To obtain the high-quality self-invoking problem solutions, we adopt main remediation strategies including: (1) implementing input validation, (2) adding type checking, (3) handling edge cases explicitly, and (4) refining problem specifications when necessary. Beyond basic execution correctness, we also verify the self-invoking problem and solutions in the following aspects: (1) logical consistency between problem statements and test cases, (2) coverage of essential edge cases, and (3) alignment with original problem objectives.

Table 2 presents the pass@1 scores of HumanEval Pro and MBPP Pro alongside those of other relevant benchmarks, including HumanEval, HumanEval+, MBPP, and MBPP+ (Liu et al.,

2024), highlighting the following salient observations: 1) Most LLMs have a 10% to 15% absolute performance drop on self-invoking code generation benchmarks. 2) Large size open-source LLMs have comparable performance with proprietary LLMs on self-invoking benchmarks. Notably, DeepseekCoder-V2-instruct achieves 77.4% on HumanEval Pro, surpassing the score of all propri-

etary LLMs. 3) Most instruction-tuned models have less improvements on self-invoking code generation benchmarks (e.g., HumanEval Pro) than traditional benchmarks (e.g.,HumanEval). For instance, Qwen2.5Coder-32B-instruct have 26.8% absolute improvement on HumanEval compared to Qwen2.5Coder-32B-base (from 65.9% to 92.7%) but only 8.5% on HumanEval Pro (from 61.6% to 70.1%). Appendix A also presents the evaluation results for different k values with the sampling generation strategy. Section 4 provides detailed analysis for these results.

### 5 Analysis

Frontier LLMs still face challenges in selfinvoking code generation. Table 2 and Figure 3 present the comparison between HumanEval Pro (or MBPP Pro) and HumanEval (or MBPP). As shown in Table 2, while 1-shot prompting im-

proves model performance on HumanEval Pro and MBPP Pro, the pass@1 scores achieved on these datasets remain notably lower compared to their counterparts on the original HumanEval and MBPP benchmarks. This performance gap indicates that although current LLMs excel at direct code generation tasks, they struggle to maintain comparable performance when tasked with selfinvoking code generation for complex problems. Notably, even the SoTA reasoning model o1-mini, that achieves an impressive 96.2% pass@1 on HumanEval, demonstrates significant performance degradation when tackling more complex problems, as evidenced by its lower 76.2 pass@1 score on HumanEval Pro under zero-shot setting.

on self-supervised learning, and a subsequent supervised fine-tuning stage based on <instruction, response> pairs. Previous studies (Luo et al., 2023; Hui et al., 2024; Wei et al., 2024) have shown that the instruction-based supervised fine-tuning stage can significantly enhance the code generation capabilities of base models on traditional benchmarks. For example, as shown in Table 2, Qwen2.5-Coderinstruct 7B started with the Qwen2.5-Coder-7B base model and improved the HumanEval pass@1 score from 61.6% to 88.4%. There remains new curiosity about whether these instruction-tuned models still show such significant improvements under a new problem solving scenario. In this section, we explore this through our new benchmarks.

Overall, this suggests that while instruction-based fine-tuning significantly improves performance on simpler benchmarks like HumanEval (+) (or MBPP (+)), its efficiency diminishes for more complex self-invoking code generation tasks. On the other hand, base models like Qwen2.5-Coder-base and Deepseek-Coder-base have a higher

than instruct models, which indicates that they have elevated training potential on self-invoking code generation task.

The instruction-tuned models demonstrate only marginal improvements compared to the base models on self-invoking code generation. In Figure 4, we plot the previous reported HumanEval (or MBPP) scores against the results on HumanEval Pro and MBPP Pro (HumanEval+ and MBPP+). From the Figure 4, we have an interesting finding: When observing the correlation between HumanEval (or MBPP) and HumanEval Pro (or MBPP Pro), we see that the orange dot (indicates base model) is always to the upper left of the blue dot (indicates instruction-tuned model). However, for the comparison between HumanEval (or MBPP) and HumanEval+ (or MBPP+), the blue

5.2 Confusion Matrix Correlation for Different Models

From Table 2, we observe that most LLMs have a score gap between direct code generation and selfinvoking code generation tasks. To better understand the correlation and overlap between these two kinds of tasks, we compare the number of problems passed and failed in HumanEval Pro and MBPP Pro with their corresponding base problems in HumanEval and MBPP. Figure 5 presents an array of confusion matrix over problems, highlighting the following salient observations:

that can self-invoke effectively. Although some SoTA LLMs such as Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-instruct successfully solve 90% of base problems on the original HumanEval and MBPP benchmarks, over 25% of problems still fail on more challenging HumanEval Pro and MBPP Pro benchmarks with self-invoking code generation (as shown in the top right of each subfigure in Figure 5). This suggests that the drop in the model’s scores on HumanEval Pro and MBPP Pro is largely due to its lower accuracy in generating self-invoking code compared to direct code generation.

The instruction-tuned model does not significantly outperform the base model in selfinvoking code generation task. From the confusion matrices of the base model and the instruct model in Figure 5, we can observe a trend: the instruction-tuned model typically has a significantly higher number of (Passed, Passed) instances compared to the base model. However, for samples that pass the base problems but fail in HumanEval Pro and MBPP Pro, i.e., (Failed, Passed), the instruct model does not demonstrate notable improvement. This observation underscores our argument in Section 5.1: current instruction-based fine-tuning approaches are insufficiently effective for more complex selfinvoking code generation tasks.

#### 5.3 Chain-of-Thought Prompting

To evaluate the impact of the model’s reasoning ability, we evaluated the performance of GPT-4o, DeepseekV2.5, Qwen2.5-Coder-instruct (7B and 32B) with and without Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting (Wei et al., 2022) on HumanEval Pro and MBPP Pro. The full prompt we use is shown in Appendix F.2. For CoT prompting, we used the greedy decoding strategy for generation to align the results before. As shown in Table 4, after applying CoT, the pass@1 of the selected models on HumanEval Pro witnesses a significant improvement. Notably, the accuracy of GPT-4o increases from 75.0% to 78.0%. On MBPP Pro, although the model does not show a significant improvement, it still maintains its original performance level, indicating that CoT can enhance the accuracy of model-generated code to a notable degree.

CoT could help Code LLMs to generate more reliable code when scheduling across multiple code-related problems. To further study which aspects of code LLM can be improved by CoT, we use Python to run the code generated by GPT4o with and without CoT, and present the number of all error types that occurred in Figure 6. We have two main observations: (1) With CoT prompting, the AssertionError number decreases from 28 to 24. This indicates that CoT prompting enables the model to generate code that more frequently passes test cases. (2) The NameError number de-

creases, which indicates that CoT prompting helps the model produce more self-contained code snippets and reduces the use of undefined variables. These findings highlight that CoT prompting could help LLMs to generate more accurate and reliable solution on self-invoking code generation task.

#### 5.4 Error Analysis

In order to further understand the failure modes across different LLMs, we analyze the errors encountered in code generated by different LLMs for HumanEval Pro and MBPP Pro problems and categorize them by error type. The result is shown in Figure 7. Primarily, AssertionErrors constitute the primary source of errors for all models on selfinvoking code generation task, which suggests that the majority of errors are still due to failing test cases. Secondly, the NameErrors, which is often caused by the undefined variable or function, contribute significantly to the error rate. This suggests that despite the function infomation being provided in the prompt, many functions still fail to generate the correct function header. This may indicate that the LLM has issues with understanding or correctly utilizing the provided information. Finally, we also found that some TypeErrors and ValueErrors accounted for a relatively small proportion of errors, which shows that LLM still has some deficiencies in handling variable types and usage when

generating self-invoking code.

### 6 Generalization Study of Self-invoking Code Generation

#### 6.1 BigCodeBench-Lite Pro Benchmark

To study self-invoking code generation on a wider range of programming problems, we construct BigCodeBench-Lite Pro, a small self-invoking code generation benchmark derived from BigCodeBench (Zhuo et al., 2024). We first construct the BigCodeBench-Lite benchmark by selecting 57 problems with solve rate between 50% and 70% from BigCodeBench1. For each examples in BigCodeBench-Lite, we then curate the corresponding self-invoking problem as well as test cases, following the same procedure described in Section 3. After further filtering by human experts, BigCodeBench-Lite Pro contains 57 self-invoking programming problems from different topics.

#### 6.2 Results Analysis

We evaluate a set of LLMs on BigCodeBench-Lite Pro. Table 5 presents the results (pass@1) of vari-

1We use reported statistics in https://huggingface.co/ datasets/bigcode/bigcodebench-solve-rate.

ous Proprietary and Open-source LLMs, highlighting the following observations: (1) Although the base problems we selected has a solving rate of between 50% and 70% on BigCodeBench, only a small number of models in Table 5 have a passing rate of more than 50% on BigCodeBench-Lite Pro. This highlights the difficulty of the self-invoking code generation task. (2) The instruction-tuned models still demonstrate marginal improvements (sometimes decrease) compared to base models, which also reinforces our argument in Section 5.1.

### 7 Conclusion

We present HumanEval Pro, MBPP Pro as well as BigCodeBench-Lite Pro, a series of benchmarks to evaluate LLMs on self-invoking code generation task where the LLMs are employed to solve the base problem and use its solution to address more complex problems. Through extensive evaluation of over 20 LLMs, we found that while these models have made significant progress in traditional code generation tasks, they still struggle with more complex self-invoking code generation tasks. Furthermore, we provide extensive comparison and analysis between existing instruct model and base model. HumanEval Pro and MBPP Pro are positioned to serve as valuable benchmarks for code-related evaluations and to inspire future LLM development by shedding light on current model shortcomings and encouraging innovation in training methodologies.

### Limitations

In this paper, we present HumanEval Pro and MBPP Pro, a series of benchmarks evaluate LLMs on self-invoking code generation task. One limitation is that the programming languages of our benchmarks only includes Python due to the intrinsic limitation of original HumanEval and MBPP. Secondly, although the models have shown shortcomings in the self-invoking problem, the diversity of existing self-invoking problems in HumanEval Pro and MBPP Pro is still subject to the constraints of the original problems. Hence, future work should pay more attention to more diverse and multi-lingual self-invoking problem benchmarks.

### B Example in Benchmark Construction

Base Problem Self-invoking Problem

# You are a farmer who needs to feed a group of hungry rabbits. Each rabbit has a specific number of carrots it has already eaten and a specific number it still needs to eat. You have a limited number of carrots in stock. Write a function that takes in a list of rabbits, where each rabbit is represented by a tuple (number, need), and the total number of carrots in stock. The function should return the total number of carrots eaten by all rabbits and the number of carrots left in stock after feeding all the rabbits.

def eat(number, need, remaining): """ You're a hungry rabbit, and you already have eaten a certain number of carrots, but now you need to eat more carrots to complete the day's meals. you should return an array of [ total number of eaten carrots after your meals, the number of carrots left after your meals ] if there are not enough remaining carrots, you will eat all remaining carrots, but will still be hungry. Example:

Canonical Solution

- * eat(5, 6, 10) -> [11, 4]
- * eat(4, 8, 9) -> [12, 1]
- * eat(1, 10, 10) -> [11, 0]
- * eat(2, 11, 5) -> [7, 0] Variables: @number : integer the number of carrots that you have eaten. @need : integer the number of carrots that you need to eat. @remaining : integer the number of remaining carrots thet exist in stock Constrain:
- * 0 <= number <= 1000
- * 0 <= need <= 1000
- * 0 <= remaining <= 1000 Have fun :) """ if(need <= remaining):

def feed_rabbits(rabbits, stock):

for rabbit in rabbits: number, need = rabbit eaten, remaining_carrots = eat(number, need, remaining_carrots) total_eaten += eaten – number

return [total_eaten, remaining_carrots]

Test Cases

### E Discussion about Self-invoking Problems and Solutions

We analyze the complexity comparison between a base problem and its self-invoking counterpart by examining the line count of their canonical solutions. The line count serves as a proxy for the complexity of each problem. By comparing the number of lines required to solve the base problem with those needed for the self-invoking version, we gain insight into how the introduction of self-invocation affects the overall complexity. Generally, self-invoking problems, which often involve recursion or similar constructs, may require more lines of code to handle additional logic and edge cases, thereby increasing the complexity. This comparison helps in understanding the additional computational and conceptual challenges introduced by self-invocation.

### F Prompts

- F.1 Prompts for Benchmark Construction We set the prompt in our benchmark construction as follows:

Prompt for benchmark construction: I’ll give you a raw programming question and its solution, please generate a new problem that requires multiple calls to the raw question to solve, and generate the solution in new_solution. Please return with json format including 3 keys: ’new_problem’,’new_solution’, ’test_input´, I’ll use json.loads() to transform it to dict type. To solve new_problems, new_solution should include the multiple function calls of raw question. So new_problems will be not only a related problem but also a more complex problem than raw problem. raw problem: {raw problem} raw solution: {raw solution}

- F.2 Prompts for Evaluation We set the prompt in our evaluation as follows:

- Prompt of 0-shot: You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions. Write a solution of python file to the following problems, the solution of the second problem requires single or multiple calls to the first @@ Instruction {base problem} {self-invoking problem} @@ Response
- Prompt of 1-shot: You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions. Write a solution of python file to the following problems, the solution of the second problem requires single or multiple calls to the first solution @@ Instruction {base problem} {self-invoking problem} {example} @@ Response

Prompt with Chain-of-Thought: You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions. Write a solution of python file to the following problems, the solution of the second problem requires single or multiple calls to the first @@ Instruction {base problem} {self-invoking problem} @@ Response Let’s think step by step.
