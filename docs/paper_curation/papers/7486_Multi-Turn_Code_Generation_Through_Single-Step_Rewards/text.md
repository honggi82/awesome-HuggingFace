## Abstract

We address the problem of code generation from multi-turn execution feedback. Existing methods either generate code without feedback or use complex, hierarchical reinforcement learning to optimize multi-turn rewards. We propose a simple yet scalable approach, µCODE, that solves multi-turn code generation using only single-step rewards. Our key insight is that code generation is a one-step recoverable MDP, where the correct code can be recovered from any intermediate code state in a single turn. µCODE iteratively trains both a generator to provide code solutions conditioned on multi-turn execution feedback and a verifier to score the newly generated code. Experimental evaluations show that our approach achieves significant improvements over the stateof-the-art baselines. We provide analysis of the design choices of the reward models and policy, and show the efficacy of µCODE at utilizing the execution feedback. Our code is available here.

## 1. Introduction

Software engineers often iteratively refine their code based on execution errors. A common strategy for machine code generation is thus to repair code using execution feedback at test time (Chen et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024b; Zhao et al., 2024). However, prompting alone is insufficient as it cannot teach how to recover from all possible errors within a limited context.

We need to train models that can learn from execution feedback during training. Existing approaches fall into either single-turn or multi-turn settings. In the single-turn setting, methods either train without execution feedback (Zelikman

et al., 2022) or perform one-step corrections (Welleck et al., 2023; Ni et al., 2024). However, these struggle to iteratively correct errors over multiple turns. Multi-turn approaches, on the other hand, rely on complex reinforcement learning (RL) (Gehring et al., 2024a; Kumar et al., 2024b; Zhou et al., 2024) to optimize long-term rewards. While effective in principle, these methods suffer from sparse learning signals which makes learning inefficient.

Our key insight is that code generation is a one-step recoverable Markov Decision Process (MDP), implying that the correct code can be recovered from any intermediate state in a single step. This allows us to greedily maximize a onestep reward instead of relying on complex multi-step reward optimization. As a result, this reduces the problem from reinforcement learning, which requires exploration and credit assignment, to imitation learning, where the model simply learns to mimic correct code, leading to a more stable and efficient training process.

We propose µCODE, a simple and scalable approach for multi-turn code generation from execution feedback. During training, µCODE follows an expert iteration (Anthony et al., 2017) framework with a local search expert, enabling iterative improvement of both the generator and the expert. The process begins by rolling out the current code generator to collect interaction data with execution feedback. A single-step verifier is then trained on this data and utilized to guide a local search expert in refining the code and generating training labels. Finally, the generator is fine-tuned using these labels. Given recent trends of test-time scaling in generating high quality solutions (Brown et al., 2024; Snell et al., 2024; Wu et al., 2024), µCODE also uses the learned verifier for inference-time scaling. Here, µCODE samples N trajectories; at each step, µCODE picks the best code solution ranked by the learned verifier.

The key contributions of this work are as follows:

- 1. A novel framework, µCODE, for training code generators and verifiers through multi-turn execution feedback. We add theoretical analysis of performance bounds using the property of one-step recoverability for this task.
- 2. We propose a multi-turn Best-of-N (BoN) approach for inference-time scaling and present benefits of learned verifier to select the code solution at each turn.

- Figure 1. (a) We define the task of multi-turn code generation where for an initial problem x, the generator πθ provides a solution y1. This solution is evaluated with the public test to get execution feedback o1. At a turn t, the generator is conditioned on the history to generate solution yt ∼ πθ(.|x, y<t, o<t). The rollout ends when the turn limit is reached or the public tests pass upon which the solution is executed on private tests. Since, the agents can generate the optimal solution at any turn, this is a 1-step recoverable process. (b) Training loop of our method µCODE – which comprises of a generator and a learned verifier. During each iteration, rollouts are collected

using πθ and we train a verifier Rϕ to rank candidate solutions for a prompt. The verifier Rϕ is then used to construct a local expert and relabel the collected rollouts. Lastly, the generator is fine-tuned with this expert dataset.

- 3. Our approach µCODE outperforms leading multi-turn approaches on MBPP (Austin et al., 2021), HumanEval (Chen et al., 2021) and CodeContests (Li et al., 2022a) benchmarks. Our ablations show that learned verifiers aid in learning better generators and show promising scaling law trends with higher inference budgets.

## 2. Background

In multi-turn code generation, an agent iteratively refines a program to maximize its correctness on private test cases. Given an initial problem prompt x, at each turn t, the agent generates a complete code snippet yt and executes it on a set of public tests. The outcomes ot from these tests serve

- as observations that guide subsequent refinements. This process continues until the agent generates a code snippet

yt that passes all public tests, at which point the episode terminates, or until the maximum number of turns T is reached without success. The first successful code, yt, is then evaluated on private tests to compute the correctness score C(x,yt) ∈ {0,1}.

We model this as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), where the state is the interaction history st = {x,y1,o1,...,yt−1,ot−1} where s1 = {x}, and the action is the code snippet yt. The oracle reward is defined as R(st,yt) = R(x,yt) = C(x,yt) if yt passes all public and private tests (terminating the episode), or 0 otherwise.

During training, given a dataset of problem prompts D, the goal is to find a generator πθ(yt|x,y1,o1,...,yt−1,ot−1), that maximizes the cumulative discounted reward R(x,yt):

where γ ∈ [0,1) is the discount factor. As shown in Eq. 1, the objective optimizes for a policy to generate the correct solution with as few turns as possible. However, at any step t, the agent can generate the correct code solution yt = y⋆ such that C(x,y⋆) = 1 (as shown in Fig. 1 (a)) – a one-step recoverable process. In the following section, we describe µCODE, a simple and scalable framework that leverages the one-step recoverability and reduces the problem of reinforcement learning to imitation learning.

- Algorithm 1 µCODE: Training

inference time, the verifier is used for multi-turn BoN (3.4) for efficient search. The learned verifier has two distinct advantages over process reward functions typically used in multi-turn RL: (1) It is conditioned only on the initial prompt and the current solution, and is not dependent on previous states (2) It is trained via supervised learning on oracle reward labels. We explore two different losses:

input Initial generator π0, multi-turn code environment E,

and max iterations M

- 1: for iteration i = 1 ...M do
- 2: Rollout generator πθ in multi-turn environment E to collect datapoints Di ← {(x,st,yt,ot))}
- 3: Aggregate data D ← D ∪ Di
- 4: Train a verifier Rϕi (x,y) on D
- 5: Construct a local search expert using verifier π⋆i(x) = arg maxy∈D(x) βOR(x,y) + βLRϕ(x,y)
- 6: Relabel data D with π⋆i(x) to get D⋆i
- 7: Train πθi with fine-tuning (FT) on D⋆i
- 8: end for

Binary Cross-Entropy loss (BCE): The nominal way to train the verifier is to directly predict the oracle reward labels (Cobbe et al., 2021) as given by:

LBCE(ϕ) = −E(x,y,r)∼D[r log Rϕ(x,y) −(1 − r)log Rϕ(x,y)]

(2)

output Best generator πθ and verifier Rϕ

Bradley Terry Model (BT): Since the goal of the verifier is to relatively rank code solutions rather than predict absolute reward, we create a preference dataset and then train with a Bradley Terry loss (Ouyang et al., 2022). For every prompt x, we create pairs of correct y+ (where r = 1) and incorrect y− (where r = 0) code and define the following loss:

## 3. µCODE: Multi-turn Code Generation

We propose µCODE, a simple and scalable algorithm for multi-turn code generation using execution feedback. µCODE follows an expert iteration (Anthony et al., 2017) framework with a local search expert. µCODE iteratively trains two components – a learned verifier Rϕ to score code snippets (Section 3.2), and a generator πθ to imitate local search with the verifier (Section 3.3). This iterative process allows the generator and expert to bootstrap off each other, leading to continuous improvement. At inference time, both the generator and verifier are used as BoN search to select and execute code (Section 3.4). Finally, we analyze the performance of µCODE in Section 3.5.

LBT(ϕ) = −E(x,y+,y−)∼D[log σ(Rϕ(x, y+) − Rϕ(x, y−))].

(3)

where σ(.) is the sigmoid function. We hypothesize that BT is strictly easier to optimize as the verifier has to only focus on relative performance. This is also consistent with observations made for training process reward models, where the advantage function is easier to optimize than the absolute Q function (Setlur et al., 2024).

### 3.3. Training Generator

### 3.1. The µCODE Algorithm

- Algorithm 1 presents the iterative training procedure. At

an iteration i, the current generator πθ is rolled out in the multi-turn code environment E to generate interaction data Di ← {(x,st,yt,rt)}. Every turn t in Di includes the prompt x, interaction history st, code generated yt and the correctness score from the oracle verifier rt = R(x,yt). This data is then aggregated D ← D ∪ Di. The learned verifier Rϕi is trained on the aggregated data D. An expert is created using Rϕi to perform local search to find the optimal action π⋆i(x) = arg maxy∈D(x) Rϕi (x,y), where D(x) are all the code completions for a given prompt x. The expert π⋆i(x) relabels the data D with the optimal action. The generator πθi is then trained via fine-tuning (FT) on D. This process iterates M times, and the best generator and verifier pair on the validation dataset are returned.

### 3.2. Training Verifier

The learned verifier provides dense scores to code solutions for a given problem. At train time, this is used by the expert to perform local search to obtain optimal code. At

µCODE comprises a generator πθ trained to produce code solutions conditioned on the initial problem and execution observations from previous turns. Given a dataset D, µCODE iteratively trains the generator to find the optimal code solution labeled using the local expert over the learned verifier. For this step, µCODE extracts all code solutions from D for every problem x. An expert is then created by picking the best solution, y⋆, which achieves the highest score using the learned verifier Rϕ(x,y) when combined with the output of oracle verifier R(x,y) and is given by

y⋆ = π⋆(x) = arg max

βOR(x,y) + βLRϕ(x,y), (4)

y∈D(x)

where βO = 1.0 and βL = 0.1 denote the weights for oracle and learned rewards. Note that for creating the training dataset, we also use the ground labels from oracle verifier as they are available to the agent. The combination of both verifiers yielded better performance in our experiments. Using this expert dataset, we relabel D with the optimal solutions:

D⋆ = {(x,st,y⋆) | (x,st) ∼ D}, (5)

where D⋆ represents the expert dataset. The generator πθ is then trained via fine-tuning (FT) on this expert dataset D⋆.

- Algorithm 2 µCODE: Inference loop

Definition 3.1 (One-Step Recoverable MDP). A MDP M = (S,A,P,R,γ) with horizon T is one-step recoverable if the advantage function of the optimal policy π∗, defined as A∗(s,a) = Q∗(s,a)−V ∗(s), is uniformly bounded for all (s,a), i.e. −1 ≤ A∗(s,a) ≤ 0.

input Generator πθ, learned verifier Rϕ, turn limit T, num-

ber of rollouts N, public tests, and private tests

- 1: Set s1 = {x}, t = 1
- 2: while true do
- 3: Generate N rollouts {ytn}Nn=1 ∼ πθ(.|st)
- 4: Choose best solution yt∗ = arg maxn Rϕ(x,ytn)
- 5: Execute yt∗ to get execution feedback ot
- 6: if yt∗ passes public tests or t = T then
- 7: break;
- 8: end if
- 9: Update state st+1 = {st,yt∗,ot} and increment t
- 10: end while output Return y∗ to execute on public and private tests

Code generation is one-step recoverable MDP. Multiturn code generation satisfies one-step recoverability because the optimal policy π∗(yt|st) depends only on the problem prompt x and not the interaction history st = (x,y1,o1,...,yt−1,ot−1). Since the correctness of a code snippet yt is fully determined by x, the optimal Q-function satisfies Q∗(st,yt) = R(x,yt), where R(x,yt) ∈ {0,1}. The optimal value function is V ∗(st) = maxy

R(x,yt), so the advantage function simplifies to A∗(st,yt) = R(x,yt) − maxy′

### 3.4. Inference: Multi-turn Best-of-N

Code generation enables efficient imitation learning. There are two challenges to applying interactive imitation learning (Ross et al., 2011; Ross & Bagnell, 2014) – (1) Existence of expert policies or value functions, and (2) Recoverability of expert from arbitrary states. First, for code generation, the expert is simply the one-step reward maximizer arg maxy R(x,y). We can efficiently estimate Rϕ(x,y) to compute the expert, without needing to compute value function backups. Second, even if the learner fails to imitate the expert at any given state, the expert can perfectly recover from the next state. This results in the best possible performance bounds for imitation learning, which we formalize below.

At inference time, the goal is to generate a code solution with a fixed inference budget – denoting the number of times generators can provide one complete solution. In this work, we propose to leverage the learned verifier to improve search and code generations over successive turns with multi-turn Best-of-N (BoN). To achieve this, µCODE uses a natural extension of BoN to the multi-turn setting. At each turn, the generator produces N one-step rollouts {ytn}Nn=1 ∼ πθ(.|st) and the learned verifier picks the most promising code solution among these candidates using

yt∗ = arg max

Rϕ(x,ytn). (6)

Theorem 3.2 (Performance bound for µCODE). For a onestep recoverable MDP M with horizon T, running N iterations of µCODE yields at least one policy π such that

The selected code yt∗ is executed in the environment over public tests to obtain the execution feedback ot. This solution and the feedback is provided as context to the generator

- at the next turn to repeat this procedure. The search ends

J(π∗) − J(π) ≤ O(T(ϵ + γ(N))). (7)

once yt∗ passes all public tests or when the turn limit is reached. Consequently, even if Rϕ(·) grants a high score to a code solution, inference continues until the solution has successfully cleared all public tests, thus mitigating potential errors by Rϕ(·). The final response yt∗ is then passed through the oracle verifier to check its correctness.

where π∗ is the expert policy, ϵ is the realizability error, and γ(N) is the average regret.

Proof is in Appendix A.1. The bound O(ϵT) is much better than the worst-case scenario of O(ϵT2) for unrecoverable MDPs (Swamy et al., 2021). Thus, µCODE exploits the structure of multi-turn code generation to enable imitation learning, bypassing the need for hierarchical credit assignment. More generally, this analysis suggests that for any task where the optimal action is history-independent and recoverable in one step, reinforcement learning can be reduced to efficient imitation learning without loss of performance.

- Algorithm 2 describes our propose procedure of multi-turn BoN search. We found it beneficial to use the reward model trained with samples of the latest generator πθ (see Table 1).

### 3.5. Analysis

µCODE effectively treats multi-turn code generation as an interactive imitation learning problem by collecting rollouts from a learned policy and re-labeling them with an expert. It circumvents the exploration burden of generic reinforcement learning which has exponentially higher sample complexity (Sun et al., 2017). We briefly analyze why this problem is amenable to imitation learning and prove performance bounds for µCODE.

## 4. Experiments

Through our experiments, we aim to analyze (1) How does µCODE compare to leading state-of-the-art methods? (2) Does a learned verifier facilitate training a better generator? (3) Can the use of a learned verifier improve multi-turn BoN

search at inference time? (4) Does the test-time search show scaling law trends? (5) Which loss function works better for learning a verifier for µCODE?

### 4.1. Setup

Models. The generator model in µCODE is initialized with Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct or Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct (Dubey et al., 2024). The learned verifiers are initialized with the same models as generators and have a randomly initialized linear layer to predict a scalar score (Stiennon et al., 2020).

Datasets. We conduct experiments on MBPP (Austin et al., 2021) and HumanEval (Chen et al., 2021) where the agent needs to generate code solutions in Python given natural language descriptions. We train the methods on the MBPP training set which comprises 374 problems and evaluate on the MBPP test set and HumanEval (HE) dataset which have 500 and 164 problems. We also compare methods on the DeepMind CodeContests dataset (CC, Li et al. (2022a)) where we train on 1000 problems sampled from the training set and evaluate on the 165 problems in the test set. We further describe the prompts and the split of public and private tests in Appendix C.1 and C.2. For training, we trained RFT and µCODE for 2 iterations in MBPP and HumanEval datasets and for 1 iteration on CodeContests.

Baselines. We compare µCODE with single and multiturn baselines. For single and multi-turn settings, we report metrics with Llama-3.2-1B Instruct and Llama-3.18B-Instruct as base models. We also compare with rejection finetuning (RFT) where we collect multiple rollouts and filter trajectories with a correct solution for finetuning (FT). For multi-turn RFT, given a positive rollout {x,y1,o1,...,yT,oT}, the model is finetuned over all the sub-trajectories {si,yi+1}Ti=0−1. For the multi-turn BoN search at inference time, we used the verifier learned from the last iteration for µCODE and trained a verifier with generated rollouts for the base and RFT models. Lastly, for multi-turn BoN search at inference time, we pick the best code solution with a hybrid approach where a solution passing public tests is preferred followed by ranking solutions with a learned verifier.

Metrics. We evaluate the methods by comparing the BoN accuracy. The generator is allowed upto T = 3 turns and the final solution is used for evaluation over private tests. The BoN@1 evaluates the agent at producing the solution in the first attempt and is obtained via greedy decoding with a temperature of 0. The BoN accuracy measures the ability of verifiers to leverage test-time compute by generating N candidate solutions in parallel at each turn. At each turn, the verifier ranks N = 5 solutions (unless stated otherwise) provided by the generator. For the BoN performance, we

### 4.2. Results

In Table 1, we compare our proposed algorithm µCODE with the baselines. We first evaluate the generators using code generated via greedy sampling for each problem (BoN with N = 1). Our approach µCODE outperforms RFT across both benchmarks with 1B-sized model demonstrating the efficacy of using one-step recoverability and learned verifiers. To highlight, our method µCODE with the 1B model outperforms baselines by 2.2% and 1.3% on MBPP and HumanEval datasets. Interestingly, the performance of RFT drops when compared to the base Instruct model for the multi-turn setting which can be attributed to the fact that finetuning dataset consists of sub-trajectories with incorrect code solution at non-terminal steps. For the 8B-sized variant, we observe similar trends where we see that all algorithms benefit from the multi-turn BoN search at inference time. Additionally, µCODE performs better than both single and multi turn baselines across benchmarks.

With more inference budget and multi-turn BoN search at test-time, where the learned verifier and outcomes of public tests are used to select the best solution at each turn, we observe that every method performs better with the test-time search procedure by upto 13%. For the 1B-sized models, our method µCODE significantly outperforms baselines by 4.4% on MBPP and by 5.8% on Humaneval datasets. For the 8B-sized variant, µCODE performs better than the

baselines across datasets. On the more challenging task of CodeContests, all methods benefit from the BoN search and observe performance gains of upto 2×. On this benchmark, µCODE outperforms the RFT and base model baselines by 1.4%. We further investigate these trends with a Qwen model in Appendix B.1 and additional unit tests on MBPP and HumanEval benchmarks in Appendix B.2.

### 4.3. Analysis

To delve deeper into the improvements, we conduct a component-wise ablation study where we 1) check the effect of one-step recoverability and the learned verifier for creating the local expert (4.3.1), 2) compare different verifiers for multi-turn BoN search at test-time (4.3.2), 3) test the efficacy of agents at utilizing execution feedback (4.3.3), 4) assess scaling behaviors at inference time with number of candidate generations (N) at each turn (4.3.4), and 5) study different loss functions to train the verifiers (4.3.5).

Table 2. Comparison of using learned verifier (LV) and relabeling with one-step recoverability (One-Step) with the 1B-sized model. We observe that FT with the learned verifier RFTLV performs better than FT with the oracle verifier scores RFT. Moreover, µCODE performs best when from both verifiers are used for relabeling.

Firstly, we compare different verifiers for training to demonstrate the benefits of using dense rewards obtained from learned verifiers. The RFT baseline uses the oracle verifier to filter trajectories and does not relabel subsequences for FT. In this experiment, we compare RFT to RFTLV where the learned verifier selects the top K rollouts for each prompt ranked via the learned verifier for FT. We use K = 3 in our experiments. We observe in Table 2 that finetuning with the learned verifier outperforms the RFT baseline. In contrast to RFT, which lacks training data for prompts with no correct solutions, RFTLV effectively trains the generator to ascend the dense rewards obtained from the learned verifier.

Secondly, we present the advantages of relabeling subtrajectories with our insight of one-step recoverability. We extend the baselines with our proposed relabeling strategy described in Sec. 3.3. We call these methods µCODEOV (βO = 1, βL = 0) and CODELV (βO = 0, βL = 1) depending on the verifier used for relabeling. Table 2 shows that µCODEOV outperforms the baseline RFT presenting the

4.3.2. DOES LEARNED VERIFIER AID BON SEARCH?

We study the effect of different verifiers for ranking the candidate solutions to pick the best solution for multi-turn BoN search at inference time. We test with Random strategy where the policy randomly picks from the N solutions. We compare to using the outcomes on public tests (PT) that picks any solution that passes the public test. Note that this involves evaluating all generated solutions at every turn with all the given public tests. We also compare to selecting a solution based on scores obtained via the learned verifier only (LV). This is crucial as in certain applications such privileged information like public tests are not available and the agents can benefit from learned verifiers to improve search during inference. Lastly, we compare with the combination of public tests and using the dense scores obtained from the learned verifier to break ties at each turn (PT+LV).

In Table 3, we compare the baselines and µCODE with different verifiers at inference-time. We observe that LV outperforms Random strategy which shows that a learned verifier

- Figure 2. Compares the BoN performance at each turn (with 6 turns) on HumanEval, MBPP datasets. We also present results on a partially observable version of MBPP where we remove the public tests from the prompt to test the efficacy of methods at incorporating execution feedback– MBPP (POMDP). We observe that all methods improve performance with more turns on MBPP and HumanEval datasets. However, on MBPP (POMDP) the performance drops at first turn and µCODE closes the gap with performance on MBPP compared to the baselines demonstrating its ability to incorporate execution feedback to improve code solutions at each turn.

indeed selects better solutions amongst the candidates. Furthermore, using the outcome of public tests (PT) performed better than using learned verifiers (LV) and performs similarly on the HumanEval datset for 8B-sized models. We believe that this gap can be further reduced by learning more powerful verifiers with larger datasets. Interestingly, the hierarchical approach (PT+LV) that uses the learned verifier to break ties on the outcomes of public tests performs best across methods and datasets. We hypothesize that using learned verifiers is beneficial in two scenarios. Firstly, if multiple solutions pass the public tests, then the learned verifier can filter out incorrect solutions which may not pass private tests. Secondly, if all candidate solutions are incorrect, then the learned verifier chooses the most promising solution at each turn. This is crucial as picking a better solution with the learned verifier can lead to more relevant feedback for recovering the true solution.

4.3.3. CAN µCODE UTILIZE EXECUTION FEEDBACK?

We evaluate the ability of the trained generator to utilize execution feedback and improve the code response across turns. We report the BoN accuracy till a turn t, which denotes the accuracy of obtaining a correct solution within t turns. Note that the agents were trained with rollouts of upto

- 3 turns and we report results with 6 turns for this experiment. In Fig. 2 (left and middle), we present the results with 1Bsized models where we observe that BoN accuracy improves with successive turns across the benchmarks.

BoN accuracy over this evaluation dataset for µCODE and the baselines. We observe that the performance at first turn drops for all methods by upto 13%. With the execution feedback at each turn, µCODE improves the code solutions leading to gains of 15.9% from turn 1 to turn 6 and matches its performance on the MBPP dataset. In contrast, the base model and RFT were unable to close this gap in this partially observable setting and performed worse by around 6% that the MBPP dataset. This demonstrates the ability of µCODE to recover better code solutions at each turn by utilizing the execution feedback at each turn, a trend not observed for the Instruct model and the RFT baselines.

4.3.4. DOES µCODE SCALE WITH INFERENCE BUDGET?

[Figure 17]

Figure 3. Test-time scaling with different values of candidate solutions N at each turn. The candidate solutions are obtained from the 1B-sized generator of µCODE. We observe that the BoN performance improves with larger values of N on both datasets.

To further understand if µCODE learns to utilize execution feedback, we curated another test dataset from MBPP where we removed the sample unit tests provided in the prompt, and call it MBPP (POMDP). Removing public unit test information from the prompt makes the information from execution feedback essential and is similar to a partially observable MDP setting. In Fig. 2 (right), we compare the

In the multi-turn setting, the number of candidate solutions can rise exponentially with the number of turns. To avoid this, µCODE uses the learned verifier during inference to select the most promising candidate among N candidates at each turn, leading to a linearly increasing number of calls to the generator. In this experiment, we study the inferencetime scaling behaviors of µCODE where we scale the num-

ber of candidate generations N at each turn. Figure 3 plots the BoN with different values of N (1 ≤ N ≤ 11). With more inference time budget, we observe that the performance improves with larger number of candidates at each turn on both datasets. The BoN accuracy plateaus with N ≥ 5 for HumanEval dataset where for MBPP dataset we still observe some performance gains with larger N.

the top 3 solutions, the last two snippets are similar to the candidates from the previous turn. However, the top ranked solution is a novel solution and is more accurate as the generated code learns to extract a single digit and multiply it. With the execution feedback, µCODE generates 2 correct responses– y31 and y32 and learned verifier chooses one of them compared to the incorrect response y33.

- 4.3.5. LOSS FUNCTION FOR VERIFIER

As described in 3.2, we compare against different loss functions for training the verifier. For this experiment, we first generate multiple single step rollouts and label them via oracle verifier. Given oracle labels, we train verifiers with two loss functions – BCE and BT. During inference, the learned verifier picks the best ranked solution among the N solutions provided by the generator. Similar to (Cobbe et al., 2021), we report the BoN plot with different values of N obtained by first sampling N candidate solutions, choosing the top-ranked solution using the learned verifier, and then evaluating the solution against public and private tests. We calculate this metric over multiple samples for each value of N. In Figure 4, we observe that the verifier trained with BT loss consistently outperforms the verifier trained on BCE loss on both MBPP and HumanEval.

[Figure 18]

- Figure 4. Comparison between BCE and BT loss function for training the verifier. We train the verifiers on samples generated by the base model (Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct). The learned verifier then ranks the candidate solutions from base model and the BoN performance of selected solution is reported. The verifier trained with BT loss performs better increasing value of N.

4.3.6. QUALITATIVE RESULT

- Figure 5 presents a qualitative example of multi-turn Bestof-N search with µCODE. Through this example, we demonstrate the advantages of dense scores from the learned verifier at facilitating efficient search across turns. We generate N = 5 code solutions at each turn and show the top 3 ranked solutions using the dense scores. At the first turn,

## 5. Related Work

Prompting To Solve Multi Step Tasks A common framework for tackling multi-step tasks with LLMs is promptingbased agentic systems. Self-Debugging (Chen et al., 2023b) asks the LLM to iteratively improve code by providing execution feedback while CodeT (Chen et al., 2022) asks the LLM to generate test cases. AlphaCodium (Ridnik et al., 2024) first reflects on input instructions, generates and filters from multiple code generations, and finally iterates on public and self-generated test cases. MapCoder (Islam et al., 2024) incorporates four agents to generate example problems, plans and code, and then perform debugging. However, prompting-based agents yield limited improvements.

we observe that the last solution y13 is less accurate than the other 2 solutions y11 and y12. The top ranked solution is used to collect the environment feedback, upon which the generator comes up with N new candidate solutions. Upon

Training LLMs for Multi Step Tasks Some work has explored explicitly training critics or reward models for multi-step reasoning tasks. In the coding domain, CodeRL (Le et al., 2022) trains a token-level critic to aid in code generation and to perform inference-time search. CodeRL’s mechanics are similar to our method, but their generator is not trained for multi-step: CodeRL trains a “code repairer” which conditions on one erroneous code completion while our generator incorporates multiple. ARCHER (Zhou et al., 2024), which frames multi-step tasks via a two-level hierarchical MDP, where the higher level MDP considers completions as actions and the lower level MDP considers tokens as actions. Another line of work utilizes Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) methods for training: rStar-Math (Guan et al., 2025) trains a policy preference model to boost small LMs’ math abilities to match or exceed large reasoningbased LMs and ReST-MCTS (Zhang et al., 2024) trains a process reward model (PRM) similarly to Math-Shepherd (Wang et al., 2024a). Although µCODE’s BoN search resembles a tree search, our key insight that multi-step code generation resembles a one-step recoverable MDP allows us to collect training trajectories much more efficiently. Finally, some work has explored using verifiers only during inference time. In “Let’s Verify Step by Step” (Lightman et al., 2023), the authors demonstrate that PRMs trained on erroneous math solutions annotated by humans outperform outcome reward models for filtering multiple inference time generations. Meanwhile, AlphaCode (Li et al., 2022b) trains a test generator to evaluate multiple code solutions.

Other works omit learning a critic or reward model alto-

Figure 5. A qualitative example of multi-turn BoN search using dense rewards obtained via the learned verifier in µCODE. Here, we show the top 3 ranked solutions at each turn t where Rϕ(x, yti) ≥ Rϕ(x, ytj) for i < j. We observe that the learned verifier selects the better solution (in orange) at each turn. The selected solution is passed to public tests to retrieve execution feedback for the generator to improve the next code solution. The selected solution at each turn is better than the last (less errors highlighted in yellow), with the final solution passing all tests. Note that there are 2 correct solutions at the final turn.

gether. In the coding domain, RLEF (Gehring et al., 2024b) derives rewards only on the executor’s result on test cases and syntax checkers, and PPOCoder (Shojaee et al., 2023) additionally considers semantic and syntactic alignment, generated via data flow graphs and abstract syntax trees respectively, with a reference solution. The “oracle” rewards in these methods may not be informative for training, and in the case of PPOCoder, require complex constructs. We empirically show that having a reward model is beneficial by comparing µCODE against the RFT baseline. Meanwhile, SCoRe (Kumar et al., 2024a) splits training into a “generator” and “correction” phase, thus restricting the total number of turns to 2. RISE (Qu et al., 2024) generates recovery steps via a more powerful LLM or by selecting a sampled completion via the oracle rewards. Both methods are less efficient than µCODE, which doesn’t require generating corrections beyond generating training trajectories. Finally, FireAct (Chen et al., 2023a) and LEAP (Choudhury & Sodhi, 2024) FT ReAct style agents while RL4VLM (Zhai et al., 2024) and GLAM (Carta et al., 2024) studies training LLMs with interactive environment feedback.

## 6. Conclusion

We present µCODE, a simple and scalable method for multiturn code generation through single-step rewards. µCODE models code generation as a one-step recoverable MDP and learns to iteratively improve code with a learned verifier to guide the search. Experimental results demonstrate that µCODE outperforms methods using oracle verifiers by a large margin. We acknowledge the following limitations of this paper. Due to a limited budget, we were only able to train models with up to eight-billion parameters. It is possible that the conclusions made in this paper do not

generalize to models of larger scales. Additionally, we train models on MBPP, whose training set has only 374 examples. However, we hypothesize that more training examples will lead to better performance. Finally, our datasets are only in Python, and our findings might not generalize to other programming languages.

## Impact Statement

The proposed method for training code agents has the potential to streamline software development processes by automating routine coding tasks, thereby reducing human labor and accelerating production timelines. However, these advances will also introduce bugs, which can propagate at scale if no proper quality control is in place.

## A. Proofs

- A.1. Proof of Theorem 3.2 The proof relies on two important results.

The first is the Performance Difference Lemma (PDL) (Kakade & Langford, 2002) which states that the performance difference between any two policies can be expressed as the sum of advantages.

(st) is the advantage w.r.t. π′. We apply the PDL between the expert π∗ and the learner π

where st ∼ dπt is the induced state distribution by π, and Aπ

where the result follows from a

A⋆(st,at)π⋆(at|st) = 0

t

According to the one-step recoverable MDP definition, −1 ≤ A⋆(s,a) ≤ 0 for all (s,a). Hence we can bound the performance difference as

J(π⋆) − J(π) =

A⋆(st,at)(π⋆(a|st) − π(a|st))

The second result we use us from interactive imitation learning DAGGER (Ross et al., 2011) that reduces imitation learning to no-regret online learning. DAGGER shows that with π⋆ as the expert teacher guarantees that after N iterations, it will find at least one policy

Es∼dπ||π(.|s) − π⋆(.|s)||1 ≤ Es∼dπ||πclass(.|s) − π⋆(.|s)||1 + γ(N) (10)

where γ(N) is the average regret, and dπ is the time average distribution of states induced by policy π, πclass is the best policy in policy class.

Plugging this in we have

T

J(π⋆) − J(π) ≤

t∼dπt ||π(.|st) − π⋆(.|st)||1

Greedy experiments use temperature 0 with flags –disable-radix-cache –max-running-request 1 to ensure deterministic results while BoN search experiments use a temperature of 0.7. All experiments are capped to 1000 tokens per completion per turn.

### C.1. Prompts

- C.1.1. SINGLE STEP PROMPT

Immediately below is the prompt template to generate 1 code completion in a single-step method or to generate the 1st step in a multi-step method. Below the prompt templates are examples of the code prompt and public tests for HumanEval, MBPP, and CodeContests.

Single Step Prompt

Write a Python function implementation for the following prompt: \{prompt\} Your code should satisfy these tests: \{test\} Please follow the following instructions:

- - Reason about the problem and any base cases before writing the code.
- - You must return the implementation code in the following format: ‘‘‘python <CODE GOES HERE> ‘‘‘
- - You must only return a single code block since we only parse the first code block.
- - Do not include any tests in your code - we will run the suite and return any error feedback.
- - Include relevant import statements.

HumanEval Prompt Example

from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:

""" Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than

given threshold. >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5) False >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3) True """

HumanEval Test Example

def check(has_close_elements): assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5) == False assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3) == True

check(has_close_elements)

MBPP Prompt Example

Write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].

MBPP Test Example

- assert min_cost([[1, 2, 3], [4, 8, 2], [1, 5, 3]], 2, 2) == 8
- assert min_cost([[2, 3, 4], [5, 9, 3], [2, 6, 4]], 2, 2) == 12
- assert min_cost([[3, 4, 5], [6, 10, 4], [3, 7, 5]], 2, 2) == 16

CodeContests Prompt Example

Provide a Python solution for the following competitive programming question: Mr. Chanek has an array a of n integers. The prettiness value of a is denoted as: $$$\Sigma_{i=1}ˆ{n} {\Sigma_{j=1}ˆ{n} {\gcd(a_i, a_j) \cdot \gcd(i, j)}}$$$ where \gcd(x, y) denotes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of integers x and y. In other words, the prettiness value of an array a is the total sum of \gcd(a_i, a_j ) \cdot \gcd(i, j) for all pairs (i, j). Help Mr. Chanek find the prettiness value of a, and output the result modulo 10ˆ9 + 7! Input The first line contains an integer n (2 \leq n \leq 10ˆ5). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 \leq a_i \leq 10ˆ5). Output Output an integer denoting the prettiness value of a modulo 10ˆ9 + 7. Example Input

5 3 6 2 1 4

Output

77 Your code should be enclosed in triple backticks like so: ‘‘‘python YOUR CODE HERE ‘‘‘. Use the backticks for your code only.

CodeContests Test Example

# Input fed through stdin and output checked against stdout {’input’: [’5\n54883 59286 71521 84428 60278\n’, ’2\n83160 83160\n’], ’output’: [’1027150\n’, ’415800\n’]}

- C.1.2. FEEDBACK PROMPT

Immediately below is the prompt template for how we provide feedback in multi-step methods. The feedback only consists of executor error traces, and we provide an example from HumanEval.

Multi-Step Feedback Prompt

Feedback: \{feedback\}

HumanEval Multi-Step Feedback Prompt

Traceback (most recent call last): File "test.py", line 18, in <module> assert has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5) == False

ˆˆˆˆˆˆˆˆˆˆˆˆˆˆˆˆˆˆˆˆˆˆˆˆˆˆˆˆˆˆˆˆˆˆˆˆˆˆˆˆˆˆˆˆˆˆˆˆˆ AssertionError

### C.2. Public Private Tests

We choose a public-private test split for HumanEval and MBPP to ensure that naively passing the public tests does not guarantee private test success. For HumanEval, we use a single test from the code prompt’s docstring as the public test and the remaining tests along with the official test suite as private tests. For ease of parsing, we utilize a processed version of HumanEval, HumanEvalPack (Muennighoff et al., 2023). For MBPP, we use a single test from the official test suite as the public test, and the remaining tests and any “challenge test list” tests as private tests.
