#### Abstract

As a seemingly self-explanatory task, problem-solving has been a significant component of science and engineering. However, a general yet concrete formulation of problem-solving itself is missing. With the recent development of AI-based problem-solving agents, the demand for process-level verifiability is rapidly increasing yet underexplored. To fill these gaps, we present a principled formulation of problem-solving as a deterministic Markov decision process; a novel framework, FPS (Formal Problem-Solving), which utilizes existing FTP (formal theorem proving) environments to perform process-verified problem-solving; and D-FPS (Deductive FPS), decoupling solving and answer verification for better humanalignment. The expressiveness, soundness and completeness of the frameworks are proven. We construct three benchmarks on problem-solving: FormalMath500, a formalization of a subset of the MATH500 benchmark; MiniF2F-Solving and PutnamBench-Solving, adaptations of FTP benchmarks MiniF2F and PutnamBench. For faithful, interpretable, and human-aligned evaluation, we propose RPE (Restricted Propositional Equivalence), a symbolic approach to determine the correctness of answers by formal verification. We evaluate four prevalent FTP models and two prompting methods as baselines, solving at most 23.77% of FormalMath500, 27.47% of MiniF2F-Solving, and 0.31% of PutnamBench-Solving.

#### 1 Introduction

“In five minutes you will say that it is all so absurdly simple.”

— Sherlock Holmes Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, The Adventure of Dancing Men

Problem-solving, encompassing facets such as computation, equation solving, and counter-example construction, is the key to superintelligence [1, 2, 3]. While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in complex problem-solving [4, 5, 6, 7], their effectiveness is fundamentally constrained by the lack of process-level verification mechanisms. Current approaches struggle to ensure the correctness of intermediate reasoning steps [8], as evidenced by the prevalence of flawed derivations and hallucination in model outputs [9]. More critically, training with these data will significantly reduce model capacity [10] and lead to incorrect learning [11].

Formal theorem proving (FTP) [12] shows promise in process-level verifiability by generating machine-verifiable proofs. However, beyond proving propositions, more problems require solving unknowns. Pioneers [13, 14] enhance informal problem-solving with FTP to improve outcome-level correctness, but their solutions’1 process-level correctness are not guaranteed [15].

- Figure 1: Advantages of Formal Problem-Solving (FPS) and Deductive-FPS (D-FPS). (a) Even with sophisticated enhancements, LLMs may make reasoning flaws; (b) (c) FPS and D-FPS perform process-level verified problem-solving inside formal theorem proving environments; (c) D-FPS decouples answer deduction and validation to improve readability; (d) Informal answer checking suffer from false negatives on complex objects; (e) Restricted Propositional Equivalence (RPE) evaluates answers with symbolic heuristic in formal verification for stronger expressiveness.

A more fundamental question is, even under decades of debate [16], a rigorous definition of problem and answer does not reach a consensus, not to mention the whole problem-solving process.

To fill the above gaps, we first define basic concepts and formulate problem-solving as a deterministic Markov decision process from a formal verification perspective.

Based on the formulation, we propose FPS (Formal Problem-Solving), a framework for processverified problem-solving. The problem-solving process is implemented in existing FTP environments by coupling metavariables and enforcing constructive proofs. For find-all problems, i.e., finding all valid answers satisfying a certain proposition, we further propose D-FPS(Deductive FPS) to better align with informal reasoning. D-FPS further restricts the answer into the proposition universe and decouples the problem-solving process into a forward and backward stage: The forward stage derives the answer step-by-step, prioritizing deductive reasoning; The backward stage verifies the correctness of answers. The frameworks’ expressive, soundness, and completeness are proven.

A consequent challenge is evaluation. Some valid answers may misalign with human intuition. For example, “limn→∞ n2” itself is a valid answer to “calculate limn→∞ n2”, but a human judge prefers “0”. Existing informal answer checking methods, including exact match [17, 18, 19], Sympy [20, 6, 21], and relaxed match [22], fall short on complex math objects such a set {x ∈ R | 0 ≤ x ≤ 1} and an interval [0,1], not to mention formal objects such as Sec.Icc (0:R) (1:R). Model-based methods [23] are also unsuitable for formal mathematics.

Therefore, we propose RPE(Restricted Propositional Equivalence), which determines the equivalence between two answer terms by propositional equivalence with restricted proof automation. Experiments validate RPE’s high human-alignment with 0.9732 Cohen’s kappa [24].

A long-standing gap between informal and formal math benchmarks is the task focus. Informal ones focus on problem-solving with outcome-level correctness, while formal ones focus on theorem proving with process-level correctness. To comprehensively evaluate FPS and D-FPS, and provide an informal-formal parallel arena, we construct three benchmarks with formal problems and answers:

FormalMath500, a formalized subset of the MATH500 [6] benchmark; MiniF2F-Solving and PutnamBench-Solving: refactored subsets of FTP benchmarks MiniF2F [25] and PutnamBench [14].

Baseline experiments are conducted to analyze existing challenges and future directions. For FPS, given its analogy to FTP, we evaluate 4 SOTA models under two main FTP paradigms: proof search (InternLM2.5-StepProver [26], LeanSTaR [27]) and whole-proof generation (DeepSeek-ProverV1.5 [28], TheoremLlama [29]). For D-FPS, we evaluate direct in-context learning and Hybrid CoT

- as baselines. We also provide intuitive parallel results between FPS and FTP. Highest solving rates are 23.77% on FormalMath500, 27.47% on MiniF2F-Solving, and 0.31% on PutnamBench-Solving. However, given ground-truth answers, the highest proving rates are 47.55%, 53.60%, and 1.54%, respectively. This huge gap shows the difficulty of FPS and calls for more exploration.

#### 2 Related Works

We omit related works about philosophy and answer checking to Appendix B for brevity.

AI Methods for Informal Reasoning. Recent works [30, 31] exhibit sparks to artificial general intelligence (AGI), but complex reasoning and problem-solving tasks [32, 33, 34] remain challenging. Various methods are exploited to address this gap, including prompt engineering [35, 36, 37], tool augmentation [22, 38, 39], and pre-/post-training [40, 41, 42]. A recent trend is scaling not only at training but also inference [5, 43], aided by verification engineering [44] and process supervision [6, 45, 46, 9], However, [47] highlights that existing verifiers remain domain-limited or yield false positives. Therefore, we propose a neural-symbolic framework generalizable to well-defined problemsolving tasks, ensuring process-verifiable reasoning.

AI Methods for Formal Reasoning. Built on foundations like dependent type theory [48], formal theorem proving (FTP) environments such as Lean [49], Coq [50] and Isabelle [51] enable rigorous proof verification. Current FTP methods can be roughly divided into two paradigms. Proof search [52, 53, 26, 54] constructs proofs step-by-step by transforming proof states. Whole-proof generation methods generate full proofs in one shot, either directly from formal statements [55, 56] or translated from informal proofs [57, 58, 59]. FTP environments work as oracle verifiers [47] but are limited to proving known targets. Towards solving unknowns trustworthily, DTV [13] enhances informal reasoning via autoformalization and formal proof verification. PutnamBench[14] pioneers in using sorry placeholders to factor answers out of propositions, which enables agents to informally solve first and formally prove later. Our work aims to implement the end-to-end problem-solving process including answer derivation, soundness/completeness proof, and correctness check — within FTP environments, ensuring the entire reasoning chain is verified and the final answer is correct.

Benchmarks for Formal Reasoning. Benchmarks for FTP cover a broad spectrum of difficulty. MiniF2F [25] comprises 488 propositions up to the high-school competition level. ProofNet [60] comprises 374 propositions of undergraduate-level mathematics. FIMO [61] contains 149 IMO shortlisted propositions. PutnamBench [14] consists of 644 propositions from undergraduate-level competitions. Many propositions in MiniF2F and PutnamBench are constructed by concatenating problems and answers, which can be refactored into MiniF2F-Solving and Putnam-Solving.

#### 3 Formulations and Frameworks

Please refer to Appendix A for the background about FTP. In this section, we first present rigorous definitions of problem and answer, and formulate the problem-solving processes as a deterministic Markov decision process with a déjà vu to formal verification. Then, we propose FPS (Formal Problem-Solving), a framework to encompass problem-solving processes inside existing TP environments. In FPS, the resulting solutions are process-verified, and the soundness of answers is ensured. For find-all problems, deductive solving is usually more human-readable. We further propose D-FPS (Deductive FPS), decoupling solving and verification to enhance deductive reasoning.

3.1 Definitions and Formulations of Problem-Solving Consider the following problems (more examples and formalizations are in Appendix E.1):

- 1. Yes-no question: Does there exist a positive real number α s.t. [αn] − n is even for all n ∈ N+?
- 2. Equation: Solve x ∈ R s.t. x2 − 1 = 0.

- 3. Calculation: Calculate limn→∞ n2.

- 4. Simplification: Simplify √28x ·

√15x ·

√21x.

- 5. Counter-example construction: Find a Fermat number Fn = 22

n

+ 1 which is not prime.

All of them consist of variables (including a queried variable), hypotheses, and conclusions that the answer must satisfy. More generally, all elementary questions (whether-questions and whichquestions) [62] can be expressed in this form [3]. Their answers are terms (e.g., numbers and functions) that depend on variables defined before the queried variable. Formally,

- Definition 3.1. A problem P(ˆa) = (∀ni=1vi, pi=1 ϕi → qi=1 ψi)[a  → aˆ] is a predicate2 that maps a direct answer aˆ to a proposition. P is composed of (V,a,Φ,Ψ), where

- • Independent variables V = {vi}ni=1 is the set of variables independent to a;
- • Queriable3 a is the queried variable that occurs free in ∀ni=1vi, pi=1 ϕi → qi=1 ψi;
- • Hypotheses Φ = {ϕi}pi=1 is the set of propositions that depend on V (whose all free variables are included in V ), consisting of conditions that can be used to deduce the answer.
- • Conclusions Ψ = {ψi}qi=1 is the set of propositions which depend on V ∪ {a}, consisting of conclusions that should be satisfied.

- Definition 3.2. A direct answer is a term aˆ which depends on V .

To avoid vacuous discussions of insolvable problems and following [62], we presuppose the problems under discussion to be satisfiable. Assumption 3.3. A problem is presupposed to be satisfiable, i.e., the following propositions hold.

∀ni=1vi,

p

i=1

ϕi → ∃a,

q

i=1

ψi (1)

“Solving a problem” is essentially delineating two requirements: 1) Finding a direct answer aˆ; 2) Proving P(ˆa). A step-by-step solution simultaneously finds a valid aˆ and constructs a proof of P(ˆa). The queriable a is treated as a “hole”, which serves as a free variable and is finally filled with a direct answer aˆ. In a non-aftereffect manner, solution steps manipulate solution states, which consist of all known conditions, target conclusions, and existing holes. When all holes are filled, and all target conclusions are satisfied, the problem is successfully solved. Detailed discussions of reasoning patterns in solution steps can be found in Appendix C. In this view, the problem-solving process can be modeled as a deterministic MDP (S,A,P,R).

- Definition 3.4. A solution state S = (H,G) ∈ S maintains unfilled holes and unproven goals.

- • H is the set of unfilled holes, H = {(?hi,Vi,Φi)}si=1, where ?hi is the placeholder of the i-th hole, Vi = {vi,j}n V and other holes. Notice that circular dependency of holes is not allowed.

- i
- j=1 is a set of variables, Φi = {ϕi,j}p

- i
- j=1 is a set of hypotheses which depend on

- • G is the set of unproven goals, G = {(Vi,Φi,Ψi)}ri=1, where Vi = {vi,j}n ables, Φi = {ϕi,j}p

- i
- j=1 is a set of vari-

- i
- j=1 is a set of hypotheses dependent on V and H, and Ψi = {ψi,j}q

- i
- j=1

is a set of conclusions dependent on V and H. Each goal represents one proposition Pi = ∀n

- i
- j=1vi,j, pj=1i ϕi,j → qji=1 ψi,j should be proven.

- Definition 3.5. A solution step s ∈ A is a function s : (H,G)  → (H′,G′) that maps a solution state (H,G) to (H′,G′) by manipulating holes and goals.

Given a problem with (V,a,Φ,Ψ), the initial solution state is ({?a,V,Φ},{V,Φ,Ψ[a  →?a]}). By sequentially executing solution steps si in solution s = [si]mi=1, the initial solution state is finally transformed to the terminal state ({},{}), where all holes are filled and all goals are proven, i.e. ({},{}) = (sm◦sm−1◦···◦s1)(({?a,V,Φ},{V,Φ,Ψ})). A problem-solving agent can be rewarded if the solution is successfully constructed, i.e., Rs(S,S′) = IS′=({},{}).

- 3.2 Formal Problem-Solving Framework

Readers familiar with formal theorem proving may feel an intense déjà vu: both theorem proving and problem-solving can be modeled as a deterministic MDP, both proof states and solution states consist

2ϕ[x  → t] represents substituting a term t for a variable x in a formula ϕ at the places where x occurs free. 3We follow the terminology in [62], although our formulations differs.

- Figure 2: Demonstrations of FPS and D-FPS. FPS: After initialization, an agent iteratively executes solution steps to transform solution states until all goals are solved. A direct answer and its soundness proof can be extracted. D-FPS: The whole process is further decoupled into a forward-solving part and an optional backward-proving part. Forward-solving enforces deductive reasoning for better human readability. The direct answer and the completeness proof can be extracted upon finishing forward-solving, while the soundness proof should be extracted after finishing backward-proving.

of goals to prove and holes to fill, and both tactic applications and solution steps transform the states towards the terminal state. Based on these parallels, we implement the problem-solving processes in the FTP environment Lean 4 for its maturity and popularity. Similar implementations are also available in other environments, e.g., Coq, where more convenient eexists and evar can be used.

Problems. The theory foundation of Lean 4 is dependent type theory [63]. Therefore, for problem (V,a,Φ,Ψ), P should be rewritten in Lean 4 as

###### P(ˆa) = (∀ni=1(vi : Ti),∀pi=1(hi : ϕi),(∧qi=1ψi))[a  → aˆ]

- Prop. 1 should be rewritten as

###### ∀ni=1(vi : Ti),∀pi=1(hi : ϕi),∃(a : Ta),∧qi=1ψi (2)

where Ti is the type of the independent variable vi, Ta is the type of the queriable a, and dependent type notations are omitted for brevity.

Problem-Solving. Sec. 3.1 concludes the essence of problem-solving as finding a direct answer aˆ and a proof for P(ˆa). These two targets can be further summarized as finding a constructive proof (w.r.t a) of Prop. 2. We name this framework as FPS (Formal Problem-Solving) in line with formal theorem proving (FTP). A demo is in Fig. 2 (left), where

• Initialization. The Lean 4 environment is initialized with Prop. 2. Then, variables in V and hypotheses in Φ are introduced. The queriable a is split as a metavariable ?w by apply Exists.intro. ?w is coupled [64, 65] with the main goal h to prevent non-constructive proofs4 and

4The logical foundation of Lean, calculus of construction, follows intuitionistic logic and rejects nonconstructive axioms, e.g., the axiom of choice and the law of excluded middle. However, Lean assumes the axiom of choice (and subsequently admits the law of excluded middle) to facilitate proving.

facilitate answer extraction while maintaining semantics. Lean code and generic initial proof states are in Appendix D.1. The resulting initial solution state is State 0.

- • Solving. The solution states and solution steps are implemented as proof states and tactic applications in Lean 4. To solve a problem, starting from State 0, an agent iteratively interacts with Lean 4, manipulating the solution states. The terminal state State m consists of no unsolved goals.

Once the agent finds a sequence of tactics s = [si]mi=1 which transforms State 0 to State m, the problem is successfully solved with the formal solution s.

- • Extraction. Once the problem-solving succeeds, we extract the direct answer aˆ from the metavariable assignments in Lean kernel.

- Theorem 3.6. (Proof in Appendix F.1) FPS is sound: for any problem P and direct answer aˆ resulted from FPS, P(ˆa) holds.

Discussion. There are two main types of problems. Find-one problems are problems requiring one valid answer, e.g., counter-example construction. Find-all problems require finding all valid answers (unique one or multiple candidates), e.g., equation solving and computation. For find-all problems, FPS does not need a “completeness theorem” but ensures that all answers are found by proper formalization. For example, a multiple-answer problem with ground-truth answer set a¯ can be formalized as (V,(a : Set Tx),Φ,{a = {x : Tx| qi=1 ψi}}) or (V ∪ {(x : Tx)},(a : Set Tx),Φ,{ qi=1 ψi ↔ x ∈ a}) (neither a nor x occurs free in Φ).

The intense affinity between FPS and FTP is a double-edged sword. It allows direct application of existing FTP methods without fine-tuning. However, it inherits the flexibility from FTP, which allows mixed forward-backward reasoning and the “guess-then-check” paradigm. For find-one problems, this framework works well. For find-all problems, humans usually prefer deductive and declarative reasoning processes [66, 67, 68].

- 3.3 Deductive Formal Problem-Solving Framework

To force deductive solving for find-all problems, we focus on a “subset” of FPS, namely D-FPS (Deductive FPS), whose problems should satisfy:

- • The queriable A lives in the universe of propositions, i.e., A : Prop;
- • Ψ = {ψ ↔ A} and ψ only depends on V , i.e., A doesn’t occur free in ψ.

- Theorem 3.7. (Proof in Appendix F.2) Regarding find-all problems, the expressiveness of D-FPS is

at least as strong as that of FPS. A demo of D-FPS is in Fig. 2 (right), where

- • Initialization. The proof state is initialized as in FPS. Then, the main goal h is explicitly split into a forward goal h.mp and a backward goal h.mpr with corresponding hypotheses introduced. We use forward state to refer to the goal h.mp and the hole ?w (usually omitted for brevity), and backward state to refer to the goal h.mpr. Code implementation and generic initial proof states are in Appendix D.2. The initial forward state is Forward State 0, and the initial backward state is Backward State 0.
- • Solving. The problem-solving process is explicitly split into a forward-solving part and a backwardproving part. A problem-solving agent uses deductive reasoning to derive new conclusions in forward reasoning iteratively. If the agent simultaneously5 fills ?w and proves h.mp by a simple exact tactic, the forward-solving is finished. Then, it can early-exit or continue to finish the backward-proving part, i.e., proving h.mpr.
- • Extraction. Once forward-solving succeeds, we extract the direct answer Aˆ from the metavariable assignments in Lean kernel.

- Theorem 3.8. (Proof in Appendix F.3) D-FPS is complete: for any find-all problem with ground-truth A¯, for any direct answer Aˆ resulted from D-FPS, the following assertion holds:

∀ni=1(vi : Ti),∀pi=1(hi : ϕi),A¯ → Aˆ

- Theorem 3.9. (Proof in Appendix F.4) D-FPS is sound: for any find-all problem with ground-truth A¯, for any direct answer Aˆ resulted from D-FPS, if the backward-proving is finished, it holds:

###### ∀ni=1(vi : Ti),∀pi=1(hi : ϕi),Aˆ → A¯

5Otherwise, after ?w is filled by Aˆ, the target of the forward state is concretized as Aˆ. Hence, tactics of backward reasoning can be applied to this goal.

#### 4 Evaluation

In this section, we first define the correctness of formal answers. Then, we propose RPE (Restricted Propositional Equivalence), which determines the correctness of direct answers by propositional equality with restricted proof automation. Finally, for a comprehensive evaluation, we construct three benchmarks, FormalMath500, MiniF2F-Solving, and PutnamBench-Solving, whose difficulty ranges from grade school math to undergraduate competitions.

##### 4.1 Metric

Correctness. Even though the soundness (and completeness, for find-all problems) of answers resulting from FPS and D-FPS are formally verified, shortcuts still exist. For example, one can cheat FPS by directly constructing answer terms based on the problem predicate or by separately proving

- Prop. 2 and applying the axiom of choice to it. For D-FPS, one may assign the answer hole with q i=1 ψi itself to form a tautology. Therefore, the correctness of an answer should not only be sound

(and complete) but also aligned with human preference. Definition 4.1. A direct answer aˆ for problem (V,a,Φ,Ψ) is correct if: 1) P(ˆa) holds; 2) Answering (V,a,Φ,Ψ) with aˆ aligns with human intuition.

Restricted Propositional Equivalence. We design RPE (Restricted Propositional Equivalence) to automatically, flexibly, and faithfully model correctness in human preference: Given a formal problem (V,a,Φ,Ψ), its ground-truth answer a¯, and a direct answer aˆ, RPE holds if and only if ∀ni=1(vi : Ti), pi=1 ϕi,aˆ = a¯ can be proven by restricted proof automation T .

The idea behind RPE is intuitive. Human preferences, e.g., simplicity and elegance, are too complicated to model without prior. Fortunately, they can be captured in the human-annotated ground-truths. Therefore, it is easier to determine whether a direct answer aˆ is “human-aligned” by its “closeness” to the ground-truth answer a¯. For this purpose, Propositional equality [49], i.e., whether aˆ = a¯ can be proven, is too broad. (e.g., They cannot discriminate aforementioned tautology answer qi=1 ψi). Restricting this broadness by only allowing limited proof automation, the closeness can be faithfully and flexibly modeled, as done in [69].

The restricted proof automation T includes the following. The code template is in Appendix D.3.

- • rfl proves equalities up to definitional equality [49];
- • norm_num prove equalities by normalizing numerical expressions;
- • ring_nf proves equalities in commutative rings;
- • rw_search proves equalities by repeatedly rewriting using lemmas in Mathlib 4 [70];
- • aesop [64] is a symbolic heuristic that prioritizes normalizing and provability-preserving.

Validation of RPE. To fairly and comprehensively evaluate RPE, we uniformly sampled 300 examples from the test set of xVerify [23], each consisting of an informal problem, an informal solution generated by a diverse group of SOTA LLMs, the ground-truth informal answer, and a manually-annotated correctness label. We use xFinder [71] to extract informal answers from the informal solutions and use DeepSeek-V3 [41] with 4-shot demonstrations to transform the informal answers and corresponding ground-truths into RPE statements ∀ni=1(vi : Ti), pi=1 ϕi,aˆ = a¯. (See Appendix J.5 for detailed prompt)

RPE demonstrates strong alignment with human annotators, reaching 100% precision, 97.18% recall, and 0.9732 Cohen’s kappa [24]. Case analysis of failures in this experiment and rejected answers in the following experiments can be found in Appendix G.

##### 4.2 Benchmarks

We construct three datasets with broad topics and diverse difficulty, each containing four fields: informal problem, informal ground-truth answer, formal problem, and formal ground-truth answer. See Appendix H for the processing details and Appendix E.2 for examples.

FormalMath500 is a formalized subset of the prevalent MATH500 benchmark [6], including 387 data points: 123 about Algebra, 92 about Intermediate Algebra, 62 about Number Theory, 65 about Prealgebra, and 45 about Precalculus. They cover a wide range of difficulties annotated by [18]: 38 of Level 1, 67 of Level 2, 87 of Level 3, 96 of Level 4, and 99 of Level 5.

MiniF2F-Solving is a refactored subset of MiniF2F [25], which is composed of 488 propositions up to high-school competition-level. We rewrite these propositions to fit in the FPS and D-FPS framework, resulting in 375 data points with: 30 from AIME, 140 from MATH-Algebra, 82 from AMC,

- 3 from IMO, and 120 from MATH-Number Theory.

PutnamBench-Solving is a refactored subset of PutnamBench [14], which consist of 644 propositions from undergraduate-level competitions. PutnamBench is a pioneer at using a sorry placeholder to factor out the direct answers from problem propositions. After refactoring, the subset contains 324 data points with: 9 about Abstract Algebra, 138 about Algebra, 122 about Analysis, 14 about Combinatorics, 28 about Geometry, 25 about Linear Algebra, 49 about Number Theory, 8 about Probability, and 4 about Set Theory. (One problem may cover multiple subjects.)

#### 5 Experiments

In this section, we evaluate baseline methods for FPS and D-FPS on the three benchmarks. Given FPS’s direct affinity to TP, we take two main TP paradigms, proof search and whole-proof generation, as baselines. Moreover, to provide a side-by-side comparison with traditional TP, we evaluate these methods’ proving capability by proving P(¯a) (statement asserting the soundness of the groundtruth answer). For D-FPS, due to its novel designs relative to traditional TP, we evaluate two chain-of-thought prompting methods: direct in-context learning and hybrid CoT. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to analyze existing obstacles and future directions thoroughly. Please refer to Appendix K.1 for detailed hyperparameters and Appendix K.2 for Lean 4 environment settings.

##### 5.1 Baseline Methods

Proof Search methods sequentially construct a formal proof t by best-first search: proof states Si are nodes, tactics ti are edges, the terminal state “No goals” is the target node. Given an LLM

pθ(ti | Si), the normalized log-probabilities vi = j≤i logpθ|(ttj | Sj)

j| is used as the value function. In this paradigm, InternLM2.5-Step-Prover [26] and LeanSTaR [27] are evaluated.

Whole-Proof Generation methods perform conditional generation: Given a formal statement sf, an LLM p(t|sf) directly models the distribution of the whole proof t. In this paradigm, DeepSeekProver-V1.5 [29] and TheoremLlama [28] are evaluated.

In-Context Learning (ICL) constructs a forward formal solution by directly prompting DeepSeekV3 [41] with 10-shot demonstrations, each consisting of the original informal problem, the initial forward state, and a ground-truth forward solution. The demonstrations are randomly sampled from the MATH [18] train set, with 2 for each subject.

Hybrid Chain-of-Thought (Hybrid CoT) constructs a forward formal solution by alternatively generating informal thoughts and formal solution steps to combine the flexibility of informal reasoning and the rigor of formal verification. We conduct in-context learning on DeepSeek-V3 [41] with 10shot demonstrations identical to In-Context Learning. Those demonstrations are manually annotated with aligned informal reasoning steps.

- 5.2 Results and Discussions Experiment results are summarized in Table 1, where three indicators are reported:

- • Solved. The portion of problems whose direct answers and proofs are successfully constructed and the direct answers are correct under RPE.
- • Proven. The portion of problems for which the correctness of ground-truth answers P(¯a) is proven. Proven and Solved compare proving a proposition and solving an unknown in parallel.
- • NE-Submitted. The portion of problems whose direct answers and proofs are successfully constructed, but the direct answers are not equivalent to ground-truths under RPE.

Comparison between Solving and Proving. The best indicators between proof search and wholeproof generation do not vary much. However, comparisons between Solved and Proven exhibit consistently6 high discrepancies. SOTA methods can prove 47.55% of FormalMath500 and 53.60% of MiniF2F-Solving. However, the highest solving rates are 23.77% and 27.47%, nearly half of proving. We speculate that the vast difference stems from two extra requirements of problem-

6The only exception is TheoremLlama, for which we have double-checked the experiments.

Bold numbers highlight the best values for each metric; Solved indicates the portion that is successfully solved; Proven indicates the portion whose statements (asserting the correctness of ground-truth answer) are proven; NE-Submitted indicates the portion of problems whose submitted answers are incorrect under RPE.

solving: continuously handling coupled metavariables [65] and deriving unknowns based on existing conditions. This calls for future work in supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on problem-solving data.

Comparison between FPS and D-FPS. Methods under the D-FPS framework result in lower solving capability than those under FPS. This meets our expectations since D-FPS has more constraints than FPS and a larger gap to TP. Notably, D-FPS demonstrates significantly lower NE-Submitted than FPS. This might be because existing models are pretrained or SFTed on TP data, which contains severe inductive bias to construct an arbitrary term corresponding to the target type as the proof term. However, FPS requires finding a correct term, which should not only be sound and complete but also align with human intuition. A Venn graph of solved problems can be found in Appendix I.1, where D-FPS shows a strong complementarity to FPS. Preference model experiments can be found in Appendix I.2, where D-FPS demonstrates a clear advantage over FPS on human-alignment (avg. > 0.75 on two preference models). Case studies of model-generated solutions are in Appendix I.4.

Nearly zero NE-Submitted rate of D-FPS depicts a promising picture of unsupervised problemsolving: even without a ground-truth answer, perfect inference-scaling [47] with D-FPS can derive a sound, complete, and human-aligned answer.

Comparison between Hybrid CoT and ICL. For D-FPS, Hybrid CoT demonstrates slightly better solving capability than ICL, and other indicators hold statistically negligible differences. Error analysis of Hybrid CoT and ICL can be found in Appendix I.3, which reveals that current LLMs’ underfitting on D-FPS might be the primary cause of their relatively low solving rate.

More discussions about limitations and potential future works are in Appendix L.

#### 6 Conclusion

This paper aims to systematically answer two crucial and underexplored questions: what is problemsolving, and how to conduct process-verified problem-solving. First, from a formal verification perspective, we present rigorous definitions of problem, answer, an MDP formulation of the problemsolving process, and the correctness of answers. In response to the second, we concretize the definitions and encompass the “end-to-end” problem-solving process inside existing theorem proving environments. We propose FPS (Formal Problem-Solving) framework for general problem-solving and D-FPS (Deductive FPS) framework for more human-aligned solving find-all problems. Theorems about their soundness, completeness, and expressiveness are proven. We also propose RPE (Restricted Propositional Equivalence), a formal method for faithful, interpretable, and human-aligned evaluation on answer correctness. We constructed three benchmarks, FormalMath500, MiniF2F-Solving, and PutnamBench-Solving, covering wide subjects and difficulty range for comprehensive evaluation. In 6 evaluated baselines, including SOTA FTP methods and general LLMs, at most 23.77% of FormalMath500, 27.47% of MiniF2F-Solving, and 0.31% of PutnamBench-Solving are solved.

#### A Background

##### A.1 Formal Theorem Proving

Based on the Curry-Howard isomorphism [72] (aka. propositions-as-types correspondence), interactive proof assistants such Lean [49], Coq [50] can verify proofs of mathematical theorems and assertions about complex systems by performing type check on the given terms.

To construct such a “proof term”, one can directly construct a term of the corresponding proposition’s type. This direct proof is called “term-style" proof [63]. Another incremental way is “tactic-style" proof [63] (aka. proof script), a series of tactic applications, continually reducing goals into subgoals, until all goals are resolved.

In tactic mode, proof assistants maintain a proof state, a set of proof goals. Each goal Γ ⊢ U contains a local context Γ, which is a telescope (ordered list) of declarations, and a conclusion U, which is a type to construct. Each declaration might be a local assumption (x : T) (variable declaration or hypothesis), or a local definition (x := t : T). A tactic is a partial function that manipulates the current proof state by closing a goal Γ ⊢ ϕ and creating a finite set of subgoals {Γ′i ⊢ Ui′}ni=1 (n can be 0). Tactic applications are provability-reflecting: if all subgoals {Γ′i ⊢ Ui′}ni=1 are solved, then the original goal Γ ⊢ ϕ is solved [65].

- Γ′1 ⊢ U1′
- Γ′2 ⊢ U2′

...... Γ′n ⊢ Un′

PR Γ ⊢ C

Some “safe7 tactics” are further provability-preserving, i.e. if the original goal Γ ⊢ ϕ is provable, then all subgoals {Γ′i ⊢ Ui′}ni=1 are also provable.

Γ ⊢ C

PP

Γ′1 ⊢ U1′ Γ′2 ⊢ U2′ ...... Γ′n ⊢ Un′

When sufficient information is unavailable for tactic applications, metavariables are introduced to represent "holes" in expressions. Unresolved proof goals are similarly represented by metavariables internally [73]. A metavariable is a typed placeholder that represents the same expression in all occurrences. It carries a local context (same as that of goals) and a target type (corresponding to the conclusions of goals). A metavariable must be assigned an expression of its target type, using only free variables from its local context and information from the global context.

###### A.2 Equality In Lean 4, there are three levels of equivalence between terms [74]:

- 1. Syntactic equality is the strongest kind of equivalence. Two terms are syntactically equal if they have the same syntactic structures. For example, x␣+␣0 is syntactically equal to x+␣␣0 because redundant whitespaces8 are syntactically neglected in this case, while x + 0 and x are not syntactically equal since “+ 0” do introduce syntactical difference.
- 2. Definitional equality is a relatively weaker kind of equivalence. Two terms are definitionally equal if they are convertible under a series of conversion rules, including α-conversion, η-expansion, proof irrelevance, β-reduction, etc. [75]. Although weaker than syntactic equality, definitional equality remains too strong, even for determining equivalence between propositions [69]. For instance, 2 + 1 is not definitionally equal to 1 + 2, where 1 and 2 are real numbers.

7Named by [64]. 8Here “ ” is used to emphasize whitespaces.

3. Propositional equality is the weakest kind of equivalence. Two terms t and t′ are propositionally equal if the proposition t = t′ is provable, i.e., a proof term of type t = t′ can be constructed. However, this form of equality is too weak when determining equivalence between an answer term and the ground truth. For example, in the find-all problem "Find all x of type Tx such that P x," with the ground truth S¯ of type Set Tx, a direct adaptation of the problem {x : Tx | P x} is propositionally equal to S¯.

#### B More Related Works

Philosophical Discussions. Since the proposal of erotetic logic [76], also known as the logic of questions and answers [62], a significant body of discussions has emerged concerning questions, answers, and their relations from the perspectives of philosophy, linguistics, and logic. Within their consensus, questions are categorized into elementary questions (including whether-questions and which-questions), why-questions, and embedded questions (aka. indirect questions).

The semantics of elementary questions can be broadly summarized into four theories [16]. Among these, Hamblin Semantics, Partition Semantics, and Inquisitive Semantics are proposition-set theories, as they conceptualize the meaning of questions as sets of propositions. In Hamblin Semantics [77, 78, 62], a question is defined as a function that maps a possible world into a set of propositions, each corresponding to a possible answer, where a possible world refers to a complete and consistent way how things could have been [79]. [3] further defines a problem as the constraints on the solution and the requirement that a solution exists. However, Hamblin Semantics lack a clear definition for “what a possible answer should be.” To solve this limitation, Partition Semantics [80, 81] restricts that the set of propositions, which a question maps to, must be mutually exclusive and exhaustively cover the entire logical space. The resulting definition of possible answers is a “true exhaustive answer.” However, in some cases, the “true exhaustive answer” is challenging to specify. Another attempt to clarify the definition of possible answers is Inquisitive Semantics [82, 83, 84], which extends classical logic by incorporating questions and interrogatives, treating both questions and propositions as fundamental concepts. This line of theories defines the meaning of questions as downward-closed proposition sets.

Our work differs by formalizing both whether- and which-questions and their solving processes from the perspective of formal verification. This enables seamless integration with existing theorem proving environments.

Evaluation of Answer Correctness. Existing methods are all designed for informal problem-solving. They evaluate by string matching [17, 18, 19], symbolic equivalence [20, 6, 21] via SymPy [85], or domain-specific LLMs [23]. However, these methods may lack numerical robustness (e.g., falsepositive between 0.999999997 and 1), fall short in complex answers (e.g., false negative between {x ∈ R | 0 ≤ x ≤ 1} and [0,1]), or rely on LLMs.

In contrast, we propose a symbolic approach based on formal verification, providing expressive, interpretable, human-aligned, and light-weighted correctness checking.

#### C Exemplar Reasoning Patterns

There are dazzlingly many reasoning patterns in problem-solving that can unify in this formulation, to name a few:

- • Deriving a new condition by deductive reasoning on conditions Φi. This step adds one new condition ϕ′i to Φi if pj=1i,j ϕi,j → ϕ′i;
- • Deducing necessary conditions of the answer by partial deductive reasoning [86] on the conditions Φ and conclusions Ψ; This step adds one new condition qji,j=1 ψi,j → ϕ′i to Φi if ( pj=1i,j ϕi,j ∧ qji,j=1 ψi,j) → ϕ′i;
- • Drawing sufficient conditions of conclusions Ψ by backward reasoning. This step replaces one conclusion ψi,j to ψi,j′ if ψi,j′ → ψi,j;
- • Case-by-case discussion. This step replaces one goal with multiple goals and adds one concrete condition to each goal;

- • Extracting a new hole from one ∃-quantified conclusion. This step replaces the quantified variable with a newly introduced hole;
- • Filling the hole a with a term and proposing possibly other holes. This step replaces every occurrence of the hole into a term and removes the hole.

- 1. Yes-no question: Does there exist a positive real number α such that [αn] − n is even for all integers n > 0? The formalization is straight-forward as: V = ∅,Φ = ∅,aˆ := True, and

Ψ = {a ∈ {True,False}, (a ↔ ∃α,∀n ∈ Z,n > 0 → ([αn] − n) := 0 mod 2)}

- 5. Physics Modeling: A spherical droplet falls through the stationary mist, absorbing all encountered water molecules. Assuming the droplet remains spherical, mist density is uniform, air viscosity is negligible, and gravitational acceleration g is constant. After sufficient time, the droplet’s acceleration approaches a steady value. Determine this value.

The answer is 17g. Interestingly. it doesn’t depend on various variables such as the mist density and the density of water.

We denote the mass of the droplet by m, the velocity by v, the radius by R, the density of water by ρ, and the mass density of the mist by k. Then V = {g,ρ,k,t,m,v,R} The physical process can be modeled as

#### F Proofs of Properties

- F.1 Soundness of FPS Theorem. FPS is sound: for any problem P and direct answer aˆ resulted from FPS, P(ˆa) holds. Proof. The Lean 4 proof state of FPS initializes as:

|case h<br><br>(v1 : T1) . . . (vn : Tn) (h1 : ϕ1) · · · (hp : ϕp) ⊢ (ψ1 ∧ · · · ∧ ψq)[a  →?a]<br><br>case a<br><br>(v1 : T1) . . . (vn : Tn) (h1 : ϕ1) · · · (hp : ϕp) ⊢ Ta<br><br>|
|---|

Therefore, upon finishing the proof, we can extract from the Lean 4 kernel:

- • A term aˆ : Ta filling the metavariable ?a from the initial goal case a
- • A proof term h from the initial goal case h.

Since ?a is filled by aˆ, h is actually a proof of (∀ni=1(vi : Ti),∀pi=1(hi : ϕi),(∧qi=1ψi))[a  → aˆ], i.e. P(ˆa).

Therefore, P(ˆa) holds by the proof term h.

- F.2 Expressivenss of D-FPS for Find-All Problems

Theorem. Regarding find-all problems, the expressiveness of D-FPS is at least as strong as that of FPS. Proof. We construct an injection from an arbitrary find-all FPS problem to D-FPS while preserving semantics. Suppose the FPS problem consists of (V,(a : Ta),Φ,Ψ) and the ground-truth answer is a¯. We have ∀ni=1(vi : Ti),∀pi=1(hi : ϕi),(∧qi=1ψi)[a  → a¯] Therefore, the following assertion holds.

∀ni=1(vi : Ti),∀pi=1(hi : ϕi),∀(a : Ta),(a = a¯) → (∧qi=1ψi) (3)

Since it is a find-all problem, a¯ is the only answer (for find-unique-one problems) or the complete collection of all valid answers (for multiple-answer problems). The following assertion holds.

∀ni=1(vi : Ti),∀pi=1(hi : ϕi),∀(a : Ta),(∧qi=1ψi) → (a = a¯) (4) Therefore, composing Prop. 3 and Prop. 4, the following proposition holds:

∀ni=1(vi : Ti),∀pi=1(hi : ϕi),∀(a : Ta),(∧qi=1ψi) ↔ (a = a¯) i.e.

∀ni=1(vi : Ti),∀(a : Ta),∀pi=1(hi : ϕi),((∧qi=1ψi) ↔ A)[A  → a = a¯]

which corresponds to the D-FPS problem (V ∪ {(a : Ta)},(A : Prop),Φ,{ qi=1 ψi ↔ A}) with ground-truth answer A¯ = (a = a¯).

| |
|---|

Specifically, a multiple-answer problem with ground-truth answer a¯ formulated in FPS as (V,(a : Set Tx),Φ,{a = {x : Tx| qi=1 ψi}}) or (V ∪ {(x : Tx)},(a : Set Tx),Φ,{ qi=1 ψi ↔ x ∈ a}) can be mapped into D-FPS as (V ∪ {(x : Tx)},(A : Prop),Φ,{ qi=1 ψi ↔ A}) with ground-truth answer A¯ := x ∈ a¯ (neither a nor x occurs free in Φ).

##### F.3 Completeness of D-FPS for Find-All Problems

Theorem. D-FPS is complete: for any find-all problem with ground-truth A¯, for any direct answer Aˆ resulted from D-FPS, the following proposition holds:

∀ni=1(vi : Ti),∀pi=1(hi : ϕi),A¯ → Aˆ

Proof. Suppose the D-FPS problem consists of (V,(A : Prop),Φ,{ψ ↔ A}) and the Lean 4 proof state is initializes as:

(vn : Tn) (h1 : ϕ1) · · · (hp : ϕp) (ha : ?A)<br><br>⊢ ψ case A -- Hole of the answer<br><br>(v1 : T1) . . . (vn : Tn) (h1 : ϕ1) · · · (hp : ϕp) ⊢ Prop<br><br>|
|---|

Therefore, upon finishing forward-solving, we can extract from the Lean 4 kernel:

- • A term Aˆ : Prop filling the metavariable ?A from the initial goal case A
- • A proof term h→ from the initial goal case h→.

Since ?A is filled by Aˆ, h→ is actually a proof of

∀ni=1(vi : Ti),∀pi=1(hi : ϕi),∀(h′ : ψ),Aˆ The ground-truth A¯ satisfies

∀ni=1(vi : Ti),∀pi=1(hi : ϕi),(ψ ↔ A¯) Therefore, we have

∀ni=1(vi : Ti),∀pi=1(hi : ϕi),∀(h′ : A¯),Aˆ i.e.,

∀ni=1(vi : Ti),∀pi=1(hi : ϕi),A¯ → Aˆ

| |
|---|

##### F.4 Soundness of D-FPS for Find-All Problems

Theorem. D-FPS is sound: for any find-all problem with ground-truth A¯, for any direct answer Aˆ resulted from D-FPS, if the backward-proving is finished, the following proposition holds:

∀ni=1(vi : Ti),∀pi=1(hi : ϕi),Aˆ → A¯

Proof. Upon finishing backward-proving, apart from Aˆ, we can extract a proof term h← from the initial goal case h←. Since ?A is filled by Aˆ, h← is actually a proof of

∀ni=1(vi : Ti),∀pi=1(hi : ϕi),(∀(ha :?A),ψ)[?A  → Aˆ] i.e.,

∀ni=1(vi : Ti),∀pi=1(hi : ϕi),∀(ha : Aˆ),ψ The ground-truth A¯ satisfies

∀ni=1(vi : Ti),∀pi=1(hi : ϕi),(ψ ↔ A¯) Therefore, we have

∀ni=1(vi : Ti),∀pi=1(hi : ϕi),∀(ha : Aˆ),A¯ i.e.,

∀ni=1(vi : Ti),∀pi=1(hi : ϕi),Aˆ → A¯

| |
|---|

Notably, for find-unique-one problems (only one valid answer exists) with queriable a, if it is expressed in D-FPS as in Appendix F.2 and concludes a direct answer of the form Aˆ = (a = aˆ), a backward proof is not required anymore (completeness implies soundness). Because of the uniqueness of a¯ and Assumption 3.3, the valid answer term aˆ must be the unique one.

#### G More Analysis of RPE

##### G.1 Error Analysis on xVerify Benchmark

On the xVerify benchmark consisting of 300 examples, RPE results in 0 false positives and 4 false negatives. Their error types are categorized as follows:

- • Failure of xFinder (2 false-negatives). xFinder incorrectly extracts an intermediate result as the answer.
- • Intolerance of numerical error (1 false-negative). RPE is based on formal verification; thus, imperfect floating-point approximation should not be passed. In this false-negative, the answer 0.4667 and ground-truth 157 are not equivalent under RPE.

- • Insufficiency of proof automation (1 false-negative). RPE incorrectly determines proposi-

4 = 1 as inequivalent. This type of error does not significantly affect the following proposed benchmarks since most of the answers are simple terms instead of complicated propositions.

###### G.2 Rejected Case Study in Experiments Here, we analyze answers rejected by RPE from In-Context Learning and Hybrid CoT:

- • a = √180/2 ↔ a = 3 ∗

√5. This is correctly rejected due to insufficient simplification;

- • a = {x | x2 − 5x + 6 > 0} ↔ a = {x | x < 2 ∨ x > 3}. This is correctly rejected since the answer is directly constructed from the original problem and is insufficiently solved;

- • a = i,j,k( 2

) ↔ a = 2117. This is correctly rejected since the answer is directly constructed from the original problem and is insufficiently solved;

- • 2004%12 = 0 ↔ a = 0. This is correctly rejected since the submitted answer is irrelevant to the queriable a;

- • a = {f(R2) | f ∈ R[x,y]} ↔ a = {{x} | x ∈ R} ∪ {[x,∞) | x ∈ R} ∪ {(−∞,x] | x ∈ R} ∪ {(−∞,x) | x ∈ R} ∪ {(x,∞) | x ∈ R} ∪ {R}. This is correctly rejected since the answer is directly constructed from the original problem and is insufficiently solved.

#### H Benchmark Construction Details

FormalMath500. We exclude all Geometry and Counting & Probability problems, as their difficulty mainly lies in formalization. Once formalized, most of them collapse to simple arithmetic.

MiniF2F-Solving and PutnamBench-Solving. Many datapoints in MiniF2F and PutnamBench are originally math word problems. By filling a problem predicate P with its ground-truth answer a¯, a proposition P(¯a) is constructed for theorem proving. Based on this observation, we conduct a rule-based selection of datapoints. For MiniF2F, we collect all datapoints with informal statements ending with “Show that it is [answer]”; For PutnamBench, we collect all datapoints with factored solutions. Then, we split formal problems and answers from original formal statements and recover missing conditions/constraints due to destructive formalizations. For example, an informal problem “Find the minimum of x2 − 2x + 1” with ground-truth 0 can be formalized into “Prove that ∀x ∈ R,x2 − 2x + 1 ≥ 0” in theorem proving. However, its correct formalization in problem-solving is not “Find a s.t. ∀x ∈ R,x2 − 2x + 1 ≥ a” but “Find a s.t. ∀x ∈ R,x2 − 2x + 1 ≥ a and ∃x ∈ R,x2 − 2x + 1 = a”.

#### I More Analysis of Experiment Results

##### I.1 Distribution of Solved Problems

The Venn diagram of all problems solved in the three benchmarks by Proof Search (InternLM2.5StepProver), Whole-Proof Generation (DeepSeekProver-V1.5), and Hybrid CoT is visualized in Fig. 3. Interestingly, substantial overlap exists in the efficacy spectra of Proof Search and Whole-Proof Generation: 60.53% of their solved problems are common. However, their overlap with Formal CoT is significantly lower: 40% and 36.84%, respectively. This echoes our hypothesis that TP models are trained on existing TP data, therefore sharing inductive biases on reasoning patterns. This complementarity between FPS and D-FPS shows a promising future direction.

##### I.2 Preference Experiment

In this experiment, to validate D-FPS’s better alignment with human preference, we quantitatively evaluate preference scores on the solutions from FPS and D-FPS using preference models.

We extract formal solutions of commonly solved problems by Proof Search (InternLM2.5-StepProver), Whole-Proof Generation (DeepSeekProver-V1.5), and Hybrid CoT. All informal comments are removed to ensure a fair comparison since InternLM2.5-StepProver seldom generates informal thoughts, while Hybrid CoT always incorporates informal steps for flexible reasoning.

Results are shown in Table 2, where Hybrid CoT consistently outperforms Proof Search and WholeProof Generation by a clear margin.

##### I.3 Error Analysis of D-FPS Experiments

To provide more insights on improving D-FPS methods, we break down the failure modes of ICL and Hybrid CoT across benchmarks, as summarized in Table 3. The main error types are as follows:

- • Length: Incomplete responses truncated due to token limits.
- • Rejection: Request rejected by API providers.
- • Format: Response unparsable due to invalid format.
- • Submission: The submitted answer is irrelevant to the queriable.
- • Answer: The submitted answer is wrong (determined via HuggingFace Math-Verify [89]).
- • Solution: The formal solution fails in Lean 4 check.

ICL and Hybrid CoT share similar error distributions. For simpler benchmarks (FormalMath500 and MiniF2F-Solving), flawed solutions (∼ 70%) are the significant errors. This reveals that although the model can derive the correct answer in most cases, its rigor in mathematical steps and capability to express the solution in formal languages is insufficient. For more difficult PutnamBenchSolving, incorrect answers and irrelevant submissions are prevalent. This aligns with intuition since PutnamBench is an undergraduate-competition-level benchmark that is challenging for even human experts.

##### I.4 Case Studies

To provide an intuitive comparison, representative formal solutions of the best method in each paradigm are shown as follows.

Following [26], we set the number of children nodes in each expansion S = 32, the search budget K = 600, the sampling temperature T = 0.7, and the maximum token limit for each tactic as 256. The detailed prompt template can be found in Appendix J.1. The adopted Lean 4 interface, Pantograph [65], requires tactic applications to be specific to goals. Therefore, in each expansion step, we averagely allocate S tactic applications to each goal.

Whole-Proof Generation. Following the setting of DeepSeek-Prover-V1.5 [29], we set the search budget K = 128, sampling temperature T = 1.0, top-p value 0.95, and the maximum token limit of 2048. The detailed prompt template is in Appendix J.2.

In-Context Learning & Hybrid CoT. The search budget is set to K = 16, sampling temperature T = 1.0. In alignment with Whole-Proof Generation, we set the top-p value 0.95 and the maximum token limit of 2048. The detailed prompt templates are in Appendix J.3 and Appendix J.4. We only run forward reasoning to disentangle forward solving from backward proving and directly evaluate the resulting answers with RPE.

##### K.2 Lean Environment Settings

All relevant open-source projects are summarized in Table 5 for reproducibility. Special thanks to the authors of these excellent projects :)

The options of Lean 4 environments are summarized in Table 4. In each Pantograph [65] REPL, we import Mathlib and Aesop, while the opened namespaces vary according to problems.

##### K.3 Compute Resource Requirement

Proof Search. Each proof search experiment requires 1 Ascend-910B GPU and 32 Kunpeng-920 CPUs for 8350 minutes.

Whole-Proof Generation. Each whole-proof generation experiment requires 1 Ascend-910B GPU and 8 Kunpeng-920 CPUs for 2890 minutes.

In-Context Learning requires 16 Kunpeng-920 CPUs for 5187 minutes, consuming 33M prompt tokens and 15M completion tokens.

Hybrid CoT requires 16 Kunpeng-920 CPUs for 5050 minutes, consuming 95M prompt tokens and 13M completion tokens.

#### L Limitations

Benchmark. During the construction of the FormalMath500 benchmark, all Geometry and Counting & Probability problems are excluded. Because these problems are about elementary geometry or classical probability, the difficulty mainly lies in “formally describing the conditions and conclusions” instead of “deriving an answer based on the conditions and conclusions”. Therefore, most of them collapse to simple arithmetic once formalized. A more elegant formalization is needed, which keeps the difficulty of thinking.

Find-one Problems. The three constructed benchmarks and the evaluation method RPE focus on find-all problems (including find-unique-one problems). In contrast, find-one problems (finding one possible answer among multiple candidates) remain underexplored. This calls for benchmarks for non-trivial find-one problems (e.g., counterexample crafting) and a human-aligned evaluation method.

Method. Modern LLMs can reach > 50% [90] accuracy on the MATH-500 benchmark with informal reasoning. However, the best baseline method performs significantly lower, with an accuracy of 23.77% on the FormalMath500 benchmark. This discrepancy demonstrates an urgent demand for a domain-specific model fine-tuned on FPS data or integrating FPS capabilities into generalist LLMs.

#### M Ethics Statement

Our research focuses on performing and evaluating process-verified problem-solving. While our methods offer potential benefits for the trustworthiness and verifiability of AI reasoning, we acknowledge the importance of considering the ethical implications of deploying such models. These include ensuring the responsible use of LLMs, mitigating biases in model outputs, and addressing

accessibility concerns. We commit to making our code available for transparency and encourage the community to use our findings responsibly, considering the societal impacts of deploying LLMs.

The three benchmarks are annotated by ourselves based on existing datasets:

- • FormalMath500. The informal problems and answers are sampled from the MATH [18] dataset, which adopts the permissive MIT License;

- • MiniF2F-Solving. The original formal propositions are from the MiniF2F [25] benchmark, whose Lean subset is released under the permissive Apache 2.0 License;

- • PutnamBench-Solving. The original formal propositions are from the PutnamBench [14] benchmark, whose Lean subset is released under the permissive Apache 2.0 License;

We believe our use of the aforementioned datasets aligns with their intended purpose. We fully respect and acknowledge their authors’ valuable work and outstanding contributions to the community. In the released version, we will include their original copyright notices, license statements, disclaimers, and notices of any modifications made.

The proposed benchmarks focus on formal mathematical problem-solving and do not contain sensitive or personal information.

In this work, AI assistants are used mainly as a search engine on the Internet as well as a grammar checker for writing. We assure that human researchers have entirely led the research and writing of this work.
