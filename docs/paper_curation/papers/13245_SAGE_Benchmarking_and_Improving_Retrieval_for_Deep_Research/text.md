### Abstract

Deep research agents have emerged as powerful systems for addressing complex queries. Meanwhile, LLM-based retrievers have demonstrated strong capability in following instructions or reasoning. This raises a critical question: can LLM-based retrievers effectively contribute to deep research agent workflows? To investigate this, we introduce SAGE, a benchmark for scientific literature retrieval comprising 1,200 queries across four scientific domains, with a 200,000 paper retrieval corpus. We evaluate six deep research agents and find that all systems struggle with reasoning-intensive retrieval. Using DR Tulu as backbone, we further compare BM25 and LLM-based retrievers (i.e., ReasonIR and gte-Qwen2-7B-instruct) as alternative search tools. Surprisingly, BM25 significantly outperforms LLM-based retrievers by approximately 30%, as existing agents generate keyword-oriented sub-queries. To improve performance, we propose a corpus-level test-time scaling framework that uses LLMs to augment documents with metadata and keywords, making retrieval easier for off-the-shelf retrievers. This yields 8% and 2% gains on short-form and open-ended questions, respectively.

### 1 Introduction

Like human experts, deep research agents (OpenAI, 2025b; GoogleDeepmind, 2024; Perpelexity, 2025; Shao et al., 2025a) address complex queries by iteratively searching and synthesizing information across multiple sources. With the help of recent advances in the agentic capabilities of large language models (LLMs), these systems demonstrate strong and robust performance in benchmarks across multiple domains (Agashe et al., 2025; Zheng et al., 2025; Li et al., 2025a; Wang and Yuan, 2025; Chervonyi et al., 2025; Zhao et al., 2025).

At the core of deep research agents lie their retrieval stack (Zheng et al., 2025; Besrour et al.,

Figure 1: SAGE task overview. Given a complex question, the deep research agent (e.g., DR Tulu) iteratively reasons, generates keyword-based sub-queries, searches for relevant papers, and outputs a final answer. We first evaluate the agents with their native web-search tool, and then modify DR Tulu’s MCP service to replace web search with retrievers that performs corpus search over our paper collection.

2025). Recent advances in LLM-based retrievers have shown strong promise, particularly in their ability to follow instructions and support reasoningintensive retrieval (Shao et al., 2025b; Muennighoff et al., 2025a; Weller et al., 2025a). However, most existing commercial deep research agents adopt proprietary search APIs over large web corpora, which rely on surface-form matching. We thus ask the following research question: Whether LLMbased retrievers can effectively contribute to deep research agent workflows?

We propose to systematically study the retrieval behaviors of deep research agents with a scientific literature search task. As shown in Figure 1,

queries in this task often require a deep understanding of research concepts as well as the ability to reason across entire scholarly articles. Moreover, unlike open-domain web search, this task provides a controllable experimental environment with a fixed and well-defined corpus of scientific papers. To this end, we introduce SAGE, a deepresearch benchmark for Scientific AGentic retrieval Evaluation, consisting of 1,200 queries over a corpus of 200,000 papers spanning four scientific domains. SAGE includes two complementary types of questions: (1) short-form questions with a verifiable answer that often require intensive reasoning, and (2) open-ended questions that reflect practical research tasks such as searching related work.

We first evaluate six deep research agents, including both proprietary systems like GPT-5 (Ope-

- nAI, 2025a) and Gemini-2.5-Pro (GoogleDeepmind, 2025b) and the open-source one DR Tulu (Shao et al., 2025a). While proprietary agents perform best and DR Tulu is competitive, all systems struggle with reasoning-intensive retrieval that requires synthesizing metadata and inter-paper relationships. Using DR Tulu as the backbone agent, we further find that BM25 (Robertson et al., 1994) significantly outperforms LLM-based retrievers by about 30%. Analysis shows that the sub-queries generated by existing deep research agents are keyword-oriented. This behavior aligns well with surface-form matching, while the semantic capabilities of LLM-based retrievers falter due to mismatched query formulations.

To address the reasoning-intensive retrieval challenge, we propose a novel corpus-level test-time scaling framework. The key idea is to leverage LLMs to reason over each paper and enrich the corpus with additional signals that make retrieval easier for off-the-shelf retrievers. Specifically, we augment each paper with informative metadata and keywords. This approach yields substantial improvements on SAGE, achieving 8% gains on shortform questions and 2% on open-ended questions.

We summarize our key contributions as follows:

- • We introduce SAGE, a reasoning intensive benchmark combining short-form queries and openended queries together with a large dataset.
- • We conduct extensive evaluation and find that LLM-based retrievers collaborate poorly with deep-research agent.
- • We introduce a new framework for corpus-level test-time scaling and achieve great improvements

on both short-form and open-ended queries.

### 2 Related Work

Deep Research Agents. Deep research agents represent a new paradigm of autonomous AI systems designed to tackle complex, multi-step information-seeking tasks (Huang et al., 2025). Commercial systems including OpenAI’s Deep Research (OpenAI, 2025b), Google’s Gemini Deep Research (GoogleDeepmind, 2025a) have demonstrated impressive performance on challenging benchmarks such as BrowseComp (Wei et al., 2025). In parallel, open-source efforts have rapidly advanced, with systems such as SearchR1, WebThinker, and Tongyi Deep Research approaching competitive performance (Li et al., 2025b; Jin et al., 2025; Li et al., 2025c; Team et al., 2025). Notably, DR Tulu (Shao et al., 2025a) is the first open model explicitly trained for open-ended, longform deep research via reinforcement learning, achieving results comparable to proprietary systems on benchmarks. Despite these advances, existing deep research agents rely primarily on web search or proprietary retrieval backends. Whether such agents can function as plug-and-play solutions when paired with LLM-based retrievers over closed-domain corpora remains largely unexplored, which we systematically investigate in this work.

LLM-based Retrievers. The advent of largescale contrastive learning marked a significant advancement for retrievers (Ni et al., 2022; Gao et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2024). More recently, decoder-based retrievers such as LLM2Vec (BehnamGhader et al.,

- 2024) and GritLM (Muennighoff et al., 2025a) have emerged, repurposing generative LLMs for embedding tasks. Beyond general-purpose embeddings, recent work has explored training LLMbased retrievers to enhance specific capabilities. Promptriever (Weller et al., 2025a) introduces instruction-trained retrievers that can be prompted like language models. ReasonIR (Shao et al.,
- 2025b) presents the first retriever specifically trained for reasoning-intensive tasks such as finding similar coding problems. However, whether these retrievers can collaborate effectively with agentic search paradigms remains unexplored, and our work bridges this gap.

Test-time Scaling for Retrieval. Test-time scaling has emerged as an effective paradigm for en-

hancing model performance by allocating additional computation during inference (Snell et al., 2025; Muennighoff et al., 2025b). Within retrieval domain, Rank1 (Weller et al., 2025b) introduces the first reranking model trained to leverage testtime compute. Other approaches explore query expansion (Gao et al., 2023), query rewriting (Ma et al., 2023) and to further leverage inference-time computation. Here in our work, we investigate how corpus-level test-time scaling can adapt the corpus to better align with automatically decomposed sub-queries from deep-research agent like DR Tulu (Shao et al., 2025a) for task-specific retrieval.

### 3 SAGE Benchmark

This section introduces SAGE Benchmark. We begin with motivating SAGE (§3.1), then present data curation and evaluation metric for shot-form

- questions (§3.2), followed by those for open-ended
- questions (§3.3) and corpus construction (§3.4).

Problem Formulation. Unlike traditional RAG system, which given a query q, retrieves documents D = Retrieve(q) and generates a response conditioned on D in one shot, a deep research agent is an agentic system composed of one or more LLMs augmented with search tools. Such agents autonomously plan multi-step research procedures, retrieve information from online sources, and synthesize evidence into a comprehensive, well-cited answer. Specifically, the agent selects an action ai ∈ {think,tool,answer} at each step: reasoning internally, issuing a sub-query qi to retrieve documents Di = Retrieve(qi), or producing the final answer conditioned on the accumulated evidence j Dj. This formulation enables the agent to decompose complex questions into subqueries {q1,q2,...,qn}, progressively building an evidence base across multiple retrieval rounds.

#### 3.1 Why Scientific Literature Search?

Our primary goal is to study the retrieval behavior of deep research agents. To achieve this, we choose scientific literature search as our testbed for several reasons: (1) Task is Common and Impactful. Searching for relevant literature is an integral part of the research process, whether it is to verify if an idea has been explored before or to collect related work. Therefore a strong agentic system could significantly accelerate the scientific discovery process. (2) Controllable Domain Specific Corpus. Existing deep research tasks rely on entire web as

a corpus, limited by the use of commercial search APIs. In contrast, scientific literature search adopts collections of papers as a controlled corpus for precise evaluation of different retrievers. (3) Existing Datasets Fall Short. While several datasets exist for scientific literature search, they fail to evaluate deep research agents. This is because the papers used in these datasets are outdated and often include LLMs’ pre-existing knowledge. However, scientific literature is a rapidly evolving field, with new papers published daily. Our dataset uses up-todate papers to better study the retrieval behavior of deep research agents in a dynamic environment.

Based on these reasons, we construct SAGE, which includes 1,200 questions spanning shortform and open-ended types. These questions cover four critical scientific domains: Computer Science, Natural Science, Healthcare, and Humanities. For each domain, we curate a corpus of 50,000 upto-date papers. The statistics of our dataset are presented in Table 1.

#### 3.2 Short-form Questions

The first type of questions in SAGE is short-form questions. Similar to existing deep research benchmarks (Wei et al., 2025; Chen et al., 2025), shortform questions emphasize two key characteristics: (1) Intensive Reasoning. These questions require deep research agents to browse multiple papers, synthesize detailed and scattered information, and derive a final answer; (2) Verifiability. The answer to each question is unique and fixed, therefore the correctness is easily verifiable. An example of short-form question can be found at Figure 2.

tion 3.2 to select paper pairs. For each selected pair, we adopt GPT-5-mini (OpenAI, 2025a) to analyze the inter-relationship between the two papers and the reasons for their shared citations. Based on this analysis, GPT-5-mini (OpenAI, 2025a) generates corresponding questions. Note that each openended question has multiple ground truth papers, so we create the ground-truth using a hierarchical structure. The most relevant papers are the selected seed paper pair, followed by those cited by both papers.

Data Curation. We construct question-answer pairs from three sources: extracted paper metadata (e.g., author count, title length), figures and tables extracted using PyMuPDF (McKie, 2025), and inter-paper relationships established via reference overlap. To establish inter-paper relationships, we compute the citation overlap between papers, which we consider two papers as related if they share at least four common references in their reference lists. Specifically, we first sample a seed paper and a related paper published after 2024 from major venues in each domain (e.g., ACL, ICML, NeurIPS for computer science). Next, we extract the corresponding metadata, figures, tables, and inter-paper relationships. We then prompt LLMs (GPT-5-mini (OpenAI, 2025a) in this case) to generate questions that require reasoning across these multiple sources. The answer to each question is the seed paper itself.

Evaluation Metric. Given the list of groundtruth papers for open-ended questions, we first assign discrete relevance scores r ∈ {2,1,0}: Most Relevant (r=2) for the two seed papers; Relevant (r=1) for the intersection of the core papers’ references; and Not Relevant (r=0) for all others. We report Weighted Recall to capture all papers from both the output text and citation lists:

Evaluation Metric. We use Exact Match (EM) as the metric to evaluate whether the ground truth answer is included in the output text or citations.

where L is the set of retrieved documents, G is the set of all relevant documents, and g(r) = r is the linear gain function.

Unlike short-form questions, which primarily aim to objectively measure and compare different deep research systems (Rodriguez and Boyd-Graber, 2021), open-ended questions are grounded in realworld scenarios. They mimic the types of questions researchers encounter when conducting literature reviews and exploring new ideas. An example of open-ended question can be found at Figure 3.

#### 3.4 Corpus Construction

For each domain, we construct a 50k-paper corpus using only open-access PDFs to ensure accessibility. The corpus begins with the following: (1) the ground-truth target paper and its highest-overlap partner from the computed reference-overlap information, (2) the intersection of their references, and (3) the union of their references. We then expand the corpus by sampling papers published in or after 2020 from major venues in the respective domain until the desired corpus size is reached. Due to the limited availability of papers in the humanities, this

process results in approximately 40k papers, as we intentionally exclude very old literature.

### 4 Experiment

In this section, we first describe the experiment setup for deep research agents with web search (§4.1) and report their results on SAGE (§4.2). We then move to a controlled setting by evaluating retriever performance within the same deep-research agent (i.e., DR Tulu) using a retrieval corpus we constructed (§4.3 and §4.4). At last, we presents ablation results on short-form questions (§4.5).

#### 4.1 Web-Search Experiment Setup

We evaluate two categories of deep research agents: (1) Proprietary deep research agents, including GPT-5 (OpenAI, 2025a), GPT-5-mini (OpenAI, 2025a), GPT-5-nano (OpenAI, 2025a), Gemini-2.5Pro (GoogleDeepmind, 2025b), and Gemini-2.5Flash (GoogleDeepmind, 2025a), by using the offical APIs; (2) Open-source deep research agents, notably AI2’s recently released DR Tulu (Shao et al., 2025a), which sets a new SOTA among opensource deep-research agents. For GPT series1, we set the “reasoning effort” to “medium”, and enable web search functionality. For Gemini series, we set “thinkingBudget” to “-1” to enable dynamic thinking and give web search permission. For DR Tulu (Shao et al., 2025a), we deploy the model on a server equipped with one H100 GPU and perform inference using vLLM.

#### 4.2 Web-Search Results

Table 2 presents the results of deep research agents with web search. We have the following findings:

GPT-5 leads overall on short-form questions, while open-ended questions vary more by domain and model. On short-form questions, the GPT-5 series delivers the strongest performance across all domains, with GPT-5 achieving the best EM (71.69%). In contrast, open-ended questions induce more heterogeneous outcomes: GPT-5-nano performs best in healthcare, while Gemini-2.5-flash is competitive in computer science and humanities. Notably, DR Tulu outperforms the closed-source Gemini-2.5 series agents on short-form questions, indicating that open-source deep research agents

1We do not evaluate o3- and o4-mini-deep-research (Ope-

- nAI, 2025b), as GPT-5 already surpasses these them on complex reasoning-intensive retrieval (OpenAI, 2025a).

can match or exceed proprietary systems in precise, retrieval-heavy settings.

Search quantity is not the main driver of accuracy. On short-form questions, Gemini-2.5-flash issues nearly twice as many web-search calls as GPT-5, and DR Tulu returns an exceptionally large number of references (37.32 on average), yet both trail GPT-5 by a substantial margin. This pattern suggests that brute-force searching or reference accumulation is insufficient for precise retrieval. Instead, stronger models appear to benefit from more accurate query decomposition and more targeted evidence selection, achieving higher accuracy with fewer, better-aligned searches.

Agents adapt search effort differently across query types. When moving from short-form to open-ended questions, DR Tulu and the Gemini series reduce the number of searches, consistent with looser constraints and potentially earlier stopping. In contrast, GPT-5 increases search activity on open-ended questions and attains the best overall results, with only a modest and acceptable increase in the number of references compared with other agents.

Query decomposition strategies differ across agents. As shown in Figure 7 and Figure 8 in Appendix, the proprietary models tend to decompose queries into more phrasal, semantically structured search queries, whereas DR Tulu sub-queries more often resemble less structured keyword concatenations. This difference aligns with the observed efficiency gap, where more structured decomposition corresponds to fewer but higher-yield searches and improved retrieval precision.

#### 4.3 Corpus-Search Experiment Setup

Motivated by our web-search results on the dataset, we next investigate how LLM-based retrievers integrate with deep research workflows. We use DR Tulu (Shao et al., 2025a) as the backbone agent for all corpus-search experiments. We modify DR Tulu’s MCP service so it can only use our provided retriever as the search tool. We study three retrievers, which are as follows: BM25 (Robertson et al., 1994), a spase retriever; gte-Qwen-2-7Binstruct (Li et al., 2023), a LLM-based retriever, and ReasonIR (Shao et al., 2025b), a reasoningintensive retriever.

the URLs in the SAGE dataset (detailed in Section 3.4). We then convert them to markdown using PyMuPDF (McKie, 2025) for text and PDFPlumber (Singer-Vine and Jain, 2025) for tables. Next, we embed the first 32,000 tokens of each markdown file with the corresponding retriever to ensure that the vast majority of each PDF’s content is retained while matching the maximum input length of gte-Qwen-2-7B-instruct. We embed each document individually, setting the batch size to 1 to avoid unnecessary padding. Both ReasonIR and gte-Qwen-2-7B-instruct embeddings are computed on a single H100 GPU. We present the paper length distribution for all four domains in the Appendix Figure 9, Figure 10, Figure 11 and Figure 12.

Retrieval Setup. During experiments, the DR Tulu agent is deployed on two H100 GPUs, where one running vLLM for answer generation and the other running MCP powered by the selected re-

triever. We set the maximum search iteration to 10 and for each retriever we evaluate two settings for the number of results returned per search, which are top-5 and top-10 (i.e. k=5 and k=10). Each retrieval step return a list of paper titles together with their abstracts.

#### 4.4 Corpus-Search Results

Table 2 presents our results of DR Tulu using inhouse retrievers as search tools. We have the following main findings:

BM25 dominates LLM-based retrievers on short-form questions, while the gap for openended questions is narrower. On short-form questions, BM25 significantly outperforms LLMbased retrievers by roughly 30%, suggesting that sparse lexical matching is better aligned with multiconstraint evidence retrieval in this setting.

LLM-based retrievers suffer from reduced diversity under long-document constraints. LLM-based retrievers also face information loss when documents approach the maximum input length, and embedding convergence can further reduce per-search diversity. We define Unique References per Search (URS) as the average number of retrieved documents returned per search call, computed as the ratio of the average number of documents to the average number of searches. Under top-5 on short-form questions, BM25 achieves URS of 2.97, whereas ReasonIR attains only URS of 1.98. This indicates that LLM-based retrievers are less effective to surface the target document under a fixed search budget.

ReasonIR over-emphasizes title-level keywords (highlighted in red) and thus retrieves wrong papers. The retrieved content then reinforces this focus in subsequent retrieval steps, creating a feedback loop that increasingly prioritizes “physics-informed” in title. In contrast, BM25 remains anchored by lexical matching in similar subqueries and avoids this drift.

instruct achieve comparable performance, while ReasonIR ranks last on both query types. Notably, gte-Qwen-2-7B-instruct can even slightly outperform BM25, indicating that LLM-based retrieval can be competitive when evaluation tolerates broader evidence coverage. A case for BM25 beating LLM-based retrievers is presented in Figure 4.

Low-diversity decomposition blunts retriever differences on open-ended queries. DR Tulu exhibits relatively low diversity in its query decomposition. BM25 appears more compatible with DR Tulu’s decomposition and is more robust to long documents, but it does not open a clear advantage on open-ended queries. A plausible explanation is that DR Tulu’s sub-queries cover only a limited portion of the evidence space, so even when retrievers behave differently, multiple ground-truth targets are only partially retrieved.

Increasing per-search top-k consistently improves performance. Across all retrievers, increasing the per-search top-k yields measurable gains, and ReasonIR benefits the most. This suggests that a larger candidate set partially compensates for weaker first-page ranking, especially for LLM-based retrievers.

Query-retriever mismatch limits the value of LLM-based semantics. A key issue is a pronounced Query-Retriever Mismatch: although LLM-based retrievers are trained on naturallanguage queries, agents often generate keywordlike sub-queries, as shown in Appendix Figure 8, which poorly match the retrievers’ training distribution and can underutilize semantic capabilities.

#### 4.5 Ablation

We conduct ablation studies using short-form questions, as their answers are easier to verify. As discussed earlier, these questions span three aspects of query information: paper metadata, multimodal details, and inter-paper relationships. Manual inspection shows that leveraging any two of these components is sufficient to locate 93.67% of the tar-

get papers. Based on this observation, we examine how deep research agents exploit different sources of query information. For each model family, we select one model and report results in Table 3.

Search method strongly shapes which information matters. Different deep-research agents emphasize different components of the query, and this emphasis shifts with the search method. Under web search, DR Tulu is most sensitive to paper details, whereas under corpus-based search, inter-paper relationships become the dominant factor. Moreover, agents that share the same search method exhibit similar sensitivity patterns. For instance, both DR Tulu and Gemini-2.5-Pro rely on Google Search and are most influenced by paper details, indicating that the retrieval backend largely determines which part of query information drive performance.

### 5 Test-Time Corpus Scaling

Our analysis in Section 4 reveals a fundamental limitation of existing deep research agents: certain papers requiring intensive reasoning are inherently difficult to retrieve. Prior work (SU et al., 2025; Shao et al., 2025b) proposes to address this challenge through test-time scaling on the query side, augmenting queries with reasoning chains. In contrast, we propose an alternative form of test-time scaling at the document corpus side. The key intuition is that, rather than increasing query complexity, we incorporate reasoning-derived information into documents, making them easier to retrieve for off-the-shelf retrievers.

#### 5.1 Method

Since DR Tulu primarily issues keyword-based queries, we augment each document’s Markdown by prepending salient keywords to improve retrieval effectiveness. Specifically, we first obtain key bibliographic metadata, including publication venue, year, authors, and citation counts. In addition, we use Qwen3-Next-80BA3B-Instruct (Qwen, 2025) to process the Markdown and extract eight topic-relevant keywords that summarize the paper’s core contributions. These fields are formatted as emphasized keywords and prepended to each document, so that both bibliographic signals and high-level semantic cues are surfaced for effective keyword-based retrieval.2

2We scale the corpus by augmenting documents with additional information in bag of keywords. With LLMs, future work could explore more aggressive corpus scaling strategies,

Table 4: Performance before and after corpus-level testtime scaling. Short-form is evaluated by Exact Match (EM) (%) and open-ended by Weighted Recall (%). Improvements are shown with green background .

#### 5.2 Results

In this experiment, we set the maximum number of search iterations to 10 and retrieve the top-5 results per search. Table 4 reports the results of DR Tulu with three different retrievers, both before and after applying test-time corpus scaling.

BM25 benefits most from corpus scaling. On short-form questions, BM25 achieves absolute gain of 8.18%, LLM-based retrievers exhibit only modest improvements. This is largely because BM25 is more sensitive to keyword signals, while LLM-based retrievers, as discussed, struggle when documents approach input-length limits. Therefore, the added information makes documents only marginally easier for them.

Limited improvement on open-ended questions. All three retrievers show only marginal improvements on open-ended questions. This result aligns with our earlier observation at section 4.4 that DR Tulu ’s (and other deep research agents) generated query lacks diversity, which limits retrieval breadth and prevents corpus-level scaling from fully translating into downstream performance gains.

### 6 Conclusion

We introduce SAGE, a benchmark for reasoningintensive scientific literature retrieval. Through extensive evaluation, we reveal a critical finding: LLM-based retrievers underperform BM25 by approximately 30% in deep research agent workflows, as existing agents generate keyword-oriented subqueries. To address this limitation, we propose corpus-level test-time scaling, which enriches papers with metadata and LLM-generated keywords, and achieves consistent improvements. Our work highlights that effective collaboration between retrievers and agents requires further adaptation.

such as directly editing or rewriting each paper.

### Limitations and Future Work

We acknowledge limitations in our study. We do not perform instruction fine-tuning or alignment on the open-source deep-research agents. As a result, we are unable to assess whether training agents to adapt their query generation strategies based on the underlying retriever type could improve performance. Exploring such retriever-aware agent training remains a valuable direction for future work. Additionally, most of our behavioral analysis is conducted on DR Tulu, whose post-training procedures may significantly influence the observed agent behaviors. Consequently, our findings may not fully generalize to agents with different training recipes or base model architectures.

- A.3 Document Length Distribution
- A.4 Comparison with BrowseComp-Plus: Retriever Behavior

We observe a retriever ranking that differs from BrowseComp-Plus (Chen et al., 2025). In our experiments, BM25 consistently outperforms LLM-based dense retrievers (e.g., gte-Qwen27B-Instruct), whereas BrowseComp-Plus reports stronger performance from dense retrievers such as Qwen3-Embed-8B. We attribute the discrepancy to differences in (i) task characteristics, (ii) retriever implementations, and (iii) agent model strength and query decomposition.

Longer documents and weaker answer locality in our setting. BrowseComp-Plus uses substantially shorter documents on average (6733 tokens vs. 13376 in ours) and exhibits strong early-answer locality: truncating documents to the first 512 tokens still preserves the ground-truth answer in at least one gold document for 86.5% of queries. This property favors dense retrievers that primarily represent the document prefix. In contrast, our documents are longer and evidence is more dispersed, reducing the effectiveness of limited-window dense encoding.

Asymmetric text coverage can favor dense retrievers under early-answer locality. BrowseComp-Plus encodes only the first 4096 tokens for Qwen3-Embed-8B, while BM25 indexes the full document. When answers are front-loaded, prefix-only dense encoding can act as an implicit denoising mechanism, whereas full-text BM25 may incur additional lexical

noise. This asymmetric coverage therefore biases the comparison toward dense retrievers. In our experiments, we allow up to 32,000 tokens per document, so dense retrievers do not benefit from short-prefix encoding.

Agent strength and query decomposition modulate retriever sensitivity. BrowseComp-Plus further suggests that stronger agent models (e.g., GPT-5 and o3) are less sensitive to retriever choice, as the gap between BM25 and Qwen3-Embed8B narrows compared to weaker models (e.g., Qwen3-32B and Gemini-2.5 Flash). Moreover, BrowseComp-Plus adopts a ReAct-style framework (Yao et al., 2023) that produces naturallanguage sub-queries, while our setup (GPT-5 series, Gemini-2.5 series, and DR-Tulu) uses more keyword-oriented decomposition. This difference in query formulation can shift the relative advantage between lexical and dense retrievers.

#### A.5 Further Experiments with SearchR1-32B

As a supplement to our main experiments with DR Tulu, we evaluate another open-source deepresearch agent, SearchR1-32B (Jin et al., 2025). Table 5 summarizes corpus-search performance across domains.

SearchR1-32B exhibits near single-shot retrieval. SearchR1-32B issues only 1.1–1.2 searches per question, leaving limited room for iterative query refinement. Consequently, end-toend performance is primarily determined by the initial query formulation and the base retriever.

Natural-language querying does not obviate lexical matching. Although SearchR1-32B produces natural-language queries rather than keyword-style decompositions, BM25 remains markedly stronger on short-form questions. On open-ended questions, BM25 and gte-Qwen are closer in performance, while ReasonIR remains substantially worse, consistent with previous findings. Importantly, the average number of references is similar across retrievers, suggesting that the observed differences are driven by retrieval quality rather than references counts.
