### Abstract

Generative optimization uses large language models (LLMs) to iteratively improve artifacts (such as code, workflows or prompts) using execution feedback. It is a promising approach to building self-improving agents, yet in practice remains brittle: despite active research, only 9% of surveyed agents used any automated optimization. We argue that this brittleness arises because, to set up a learning loop, an engineer must make “hidden” design choices: What can the optimizer edit and what is the “right” learning evidence to provide at each update? We investigate three factors that affect most applications: the starting artifact, the credit horizon for execution traces, and batching trials and errors into learning evidence. Through case studies in MLAgentBench, Atari, and BigBench Extra Hard, we find that these design decisions can determine whether generative optimization succeeds, yet they are rarely made explicit in prior work. Different starting artifacts determine which solutions are reachable in MLAgentBench, truncated traces can still improve Atari agents, and larger minibatches do not monotonically improve generalization on BBEH. We conclude that the lack of a simple, universal way to set up learning loops across domains is a major hurdle for productionization and adoption. We provide practical guidance for making these choices.

### 1 Introduction

Rapid advances in the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have enabled a proliferation of software systems with the ability to perceive, plan, and reflect (Kwa et al., 2025). Recent work has shown that LLMs have the ability to generate and revise program workflows to optimize an objective (Yang et al., 2024), such as increasing compute throughput or decreasing latency of hardware accelerator kernels (Ouyang et al., 2025a; Lange et al., 2025b; Wei et al., 2025b; Zhang et al., 2025c), design novel algorithms for search and matrix multiplication (Wei et al., 2025a; Press et al., 2025; Novikov et al., 2025), exploiting security vulnerabilities (Zhang et al., 2025a; Chaudhuri et al., 2025), and propose therapeutic candidates for diseases (Ghareeb et al., 2025). This ability to optimize objectives, combined with LLMs continuing to approach human-level performance in producing complex programs (Jimenez et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2025a; El-Kishky et al., 2025; Wei et al., 2025c), gives rise to an emerging class of software that automatically changes its own behavior to achieve a desired outcome.

Automated generation and optimization with LLMs have been adopted broadly in two types of applications. The first is to use the LLM to repeatedly modify a software program to improve on

a metric, such as writing kernels that have low compute latency (Baronio et al., 2025; Wei et al., 2025b; Zhang et al., 2025c), creating automated ML pipelines to train models that achieve high test accuracy (Huang et al., 2024; Chan et al., 2025; Toledo et al., 2025), and writing a script that can exploit security vulnerabilities (Zhang et al., 2025a). The second type uses LLMs to modify another LLM system to achieve desired behavior, also using metrics like success rate, through prompt tuning and direct code revisions (Khattab et al., 2024; Yuksekgonul et al., 2025; Cheng et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2025b). The underlying mechanism in both types of applications is the same: construction of an LLM-based generative optimization process to ingest feedback and modify an existing system, which we describe as a learning loop in Section 2.

However, despite the popularity in research, LLM-based generative optimization has not been widely adopted in production. Pan et al. (2025b) report that the current development of agentic systems remains largely human-driven, with only 9% of surveyed systems employing any form of automated design, including simple LLM-assisted prompt tuning. By contrast, using LLMs to optimize programs has been more successful in specialized domains (Toledo et al., 2025; Novikov et al., 2025). In a field where end-to-end automation that scales with compute is a highly sought-after objective (Sutton, 2019; Hendrycks et al., 2025), the lack of wider adoption is puzzling, pointing to a potential gap between the high ideal of an automated LLM optimizer and reality, especially for optimizing LLM agentic systems.

This lack of adoption is not a consequence of inadequate infrastructure support or insufficient software abstraction. On the contrary, over the past two years, a rich ecosystem of powerful libraries for building agentic systems has emerged (Khattab et al., 2024; Wu et al., 2024; LangChain, 2024; Cheng et al., 2024; Li et al., 2025). Many of these libraries offer mechanisms for automatically optimizing different targets, ranging from tuning prompts (Khattab et al., 2024; Yuksekgonul et al., 2025) to program synthesis (Cheng et al., 2024). Most of them have received considerable attention from agent engineers, suggesting that the low adoption rate cannot be attributed solely to limited awareness or inadequate software.

In this paper, we hypothesize that the low adoption stems from the hidden difficulty of setting up the learning loop. Our experiments show that getting the learning loop right requires substantial engineering effort and/or guesswork. This setup burden is a major hurdle for productionization, which requires simple, universal solutions across application domains. We first introduce two core concepts that impact the learning loop in Section 2: system initialization and learning context construction. Then we examine three case studies to isolate and highlight the challenges related to these core concepts, and show how different design decisions can impact the final performance. In Section 4, we show how different system initializations impact the final model quality of an ML training pipeline. In Section 5, using the example of an Atari game-playing program, we show that engineers can specify a credit horizon that is shorter than the full gameplay trajectory and still learn programs that obtain high reward on a full playthrough, but updating the system too frequently with too short a credit horizon leads to worse performance. Finally, in Section 6, we show that the number of examples placed in the learning context matters for optimizing the prompt of an LLM call.

Interestingly, many of the challenges in setting up a learning loop for LLM-based optimization parallel well-studied concepts in machine learning. The starting artifact problem resembles neural network architecture (Zoph & Le, 2017) and weights initialization (Glorot & Bengio, 2010), where different starting points determine which solutions are reachable. The credit horizon problem mirrors horizon debates in episodic reinforcement learning (Arjona-Medina et al., 2019; Cheng et al., 2021; Laidlaw et al., 2023) and truncated back-propagation through time (Tallec & Ollivier, 2017; Shaban et al., 2019). The experience batching problem parallels batch size selection in stochastic gradient descent, where the number of examples aggregated per update affects both learning dynamics and generalization (Smith et al., 2018). However, unlike traditional ML where practitioners have developed theoretical guidance and/or heuristics, the learning loop design space for generative optimization remains largely unexplored. We suggest that the challenges of LLM-based generative optimization are similar to the challenges in traditional machine learning and can be studied systematically rather than treated as ad hoc engineering.

Figure 2: Three Key Decisions for Implementing a Learning Loop. To set up iterative generative optimization, an agent engineer must make three core decisions. For the initial system: What (1) starting artifacts ( instructions, files, specs) to provide? Different initializations can lead to different solution spaces. For the learning context ( ): What learning evidence to provide to the LLM optimizer – (2) how many steps to include per trial (credit horizon) and (3) how many trials to batch together (experience batching).

### 2 Building a Learning Loop

We start by describing the concept of a learning loop2, which is ubiquitous in a wide range of LLM-based generative optimization applications (Figure 1). We are given an initial system ( ) that takes an input and produces an output, and an oracle to give feedback ( ) that can serve as a signal for optimizing. In theory, these two terms define a learning problem conceptually. However, in practice, more details are needed to implement an actual learning loop with an LLM optimizer:

What exactly should be included in a learning context (i.e. the message to send in the LLM’s API call) so that the LLM optimizer can make effective updates? As shown in Figure 1, a typical learning context includes input, output, feedback, and initial/current system. In addition, other common information includes task background and the optimizer’s past experiences of successes/failures. Once designed, the content of the learning context will be dynamically updated during optimization to reflect the up-to-date optimization status.

Initial System

Similar to how a numerical optimization process depends on its initial condition and optimization step function, we can also break down the analysis of the learning loop into: What is the starting point? What information should be provided to the LLM optimizer at each step?

LLM Optimizer

Figure 1: The learning loop of generative optimization.

Initial System (Starting Artifact) This includes the initial code, prompt, and files that make up the system. The initial system can also consist of documentation and design sketches that are sent to an LLM programmer (such as GPT Codex, Claude Code, or Gemini CLI). The initial system is a choice made by the engineer. In addition, the engineer must also determine which part of the system can be changed by the LLM optimizer and which part is constrained, e.g., the whole codebase or just certain functions. In Section 4, we show that different designs lead to major differences in the quality of ML pipelines generated by an LLM optimizer, giving rise to the starting artifact problem.

Learning Context (Credit Horizon) Prior work often assumes either that the context is sufficient for the LLM optimizer to improve successfully (Cheng et al., 2024) or that the feedback usually contains useful signal (Nie et al., 2024; Xu et al., 2025). However, what context is necessary or sufficient can be ambiguous in practice, especially for multi-step problems, where the system being optimized is used multiple times sequentially. The agentic system community has already started to explore solutions for this problem, with early work from Zhang et al. (2025d); Sun et al. (2025); Ye et al. (2025); Zhang et al. (2025b). More generally, it is unclear how many steps of the process’s execution trace should be included in the learning context for the optimizer. Should we optimize the agent for instantaneous feedback, or should we only optimize it until all feedback in the multi-step process has been observed? In Section 5, we study an exemplar version of this problem by optimizing an Atari game-playing program, where both dense short-term (after each action) and long-term reward (after the game ends) can be used to modify the agentic system’s behavior. We see that for four

out of eight games, optimizing for short-term dense reward produced systems that also performed comparably well for the full episode. We call this the credit horizon problem, which is related to the effective horizon in RL (Laidlaw et al., 2023; Cheng et al., 2021).

Learning Context (Experience Batching) After deciding the credit horizon (the number of steps to include for the optimizer), another key decision is about how to present the experience of successes and failures of independent trials to the optimizer. The community has previously used words like memory to study this phenomenon (Zhou et al., 2025a; Chhikara et al., 2025; Ouyang et al., 2025b; Zhang et al., 2025c). However, most of these works focus on techniques for “retrieving” relevant memories. We instead focus on an even simpler but more fundamental aspect: the amount of incontext experience across independent trials provided to the optimizer through the mechanism of “batching.” In Section 6, we look at this problem in a setup inspired by batched stochastic gradient descent. We study a task involving optimization of a prompted LLM system. We explore different numbers of (input, output, feedback) triplets to put in the learning context. We observe that “batch size” affects whether the LLM optimizer can find a prompt that does well on a hidden test set. We show that the optimal number of triplets is different for each task, however, which gives rise to the experience batching problem.

In our experiments, we find that the best configurations to address all three problems are taskdependent. Different tasks require different setups in order to achieve the best results. All three problems introduce complexities and require the agent engineer to make nuanced decisions.

We note that the learning loop can be implemented with any LLM optimization and search algorithms (Novikov et al., 2025; Pan et al., 2025a; Lange et al., 2025a; Agrawal et al., 2025; Ren et al., 2026) and the main focus of our paper is to study the factors that impact the learning loop, not the small differences between individual libraries. Our goal is to investigate other lesser-known factors that critically impact the success of the optimization in order to provide practical guidelines beyond a mere choice of a “search” algorithm. We implement our experiments using the optimization framework Trace Cheng et al. (2024). We acknowledge that framework-specific factors could exist, but we note that all the factors discussed in the paper are universal to any iterative LLM-based optimization and exist across frameworks.

### 3 Related Work

Learning Loop in Self-Improving Agents The concept of a loop is widely discussed in the LLM agent community, commonly referred to as an agent loop (Zhao et al., 2025; Bolin, 2026), a sampling loop (Anthropic, 2025), or a “Ralph” loop (Huntley, 2026). These loops typically enable abilities like self-debugging (Chen et al., 2024), self-correction (Xiong et al., 2025), and self-refinement Madaan et al. (2023) to make agents more likely to succeed within a single task execution. In contrast, rather than optimizing for the highest success rate on an individual task, our learning loop is designed for continual learning through repeated trial and error (Huang et al., 2025; Monea et al., 2025). Compared with a within-task agent loop, our learning loop accumulates experience across tasks, where the success or failure of any single attempt is secondary to the agent’s eventual mastery.

Context Engineering Building the right context for LLMs has received significant attention in recent works. Beyond compression of overly long inputs, carefully constructed context can substantially improve performance across diverse tasks (Chen et al., 2026; Zhang et al., 2025d). Related concepts have been explored under the term “memory” (Wang et al., 2025b; Ouyang et al., 2025b; Zhou et al., 2025a), focusing on techniques to retrieve and manage relevant past information. We use the term learning context to refer to the evidence provided to an LLM optimizer for system improvement. We focus specifically on two aspects that have received little systematic investigation: the horizon of multi-step traces and the number of independent traces. These two factors impact LLM self-improvement loops but have not been discussed in depth in prior work.

Agentic Libraries with Learning Loops Many frameworks enable LLMs to iteratively modify systems (Yang et al., 2024), particularly for prompt optimization (Khattab et al., 2024; Cheng et al., 2024; Yuksekgonul et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2024). These works implement learning loops as candidate-selection procedures, using techniques like cross-validation (Khattab et al., 2024) or Pareto optimization (Conway et al., 2025; Agrawal et al., 2025). However, these works primarily showcase

### 4 ML Agent Case Study for the Starting Artifact Problem

An agent engineer must provide a starting point for the optimization process (the learning loop described in Section 2). We study the sensitivity of LLM-based generative optimization to the choice of initialization and parameter constraint. We found that the choice of starting artifacts can play a large role in the converged performance.

Task We use the task of creating an ML training pipeline as an example. This task has been popularized by Huang et al. (2024); Chan et al. (2025); Toledo et al. (2025), often under the name of ML agent or AI research agent. The input to the LLM optimizer includes task description and datasets, and the output of the LLM is to build a codebase that consists of data ingestion, model building, training, and hyperparameter search (model selection). The starting artifact we provide to the LLM optimizer consists of the function name, an input-output type signature, and a docstring that suggests what this function could be about along with some general heuristic, e.g. that features can be normalized.

Setup We explore two initialization options for creating an automated ML pipeline. We can ask the LLM to write a single function, train_model, which takes in a dataset and returns a trained model (Figure 3 left). Or we can follow the engineering principle of modularization to break the pipeline down to separate functions (e.g., preprocess, select_features, create_ensemble_model, and predict) and ask LLM to optimize these components explicitly (Figure 3 right). It is important to note that the single function’s docstring is equivalent to a concatenated version of all the docstrings in the many-function initialization scheme. The only difference is whether modularization, i.e. asking the LLM to implement multiple functions, is better than implementing one function. Early work suggests that decomposing a hard task into multiple easier tasks seems to help, e.g., least-to-most prompting (Zhou et al., 2023) and Parsel (Zelikman et al., 2023).

[Figure 6]

Figure 3: Starting artifacts. The one-function and many-function initializations provide equivalent docstring information but differ in pipeline modularization.

Experiment We perform a train-validation split on the dataset to create a validation partition and use the task-specific metric on the validation dataset as the optimization objective (i.e., maximize accuracy or minimize error). We follow the MLAgentBench evaluation protocol detailed in Section A. We use OptoPrime (Cheng et al., 2024) as the generative optimizer. We apply fine-grained style feedback to the generative optimizer at different stages of the task-specific validation metric (see Figure A2). For the Spaceship Titanic task, both the staged feedback and checkpoint selection use validation F1. We additionally experimented with improvement style feedback, i.e. when the model fails to improve the task-specific validation metric relative to the previous step, we append an improvement suggestion to the feedback string.

We compare against the ResearchAgent proposed by Huang et al. (2024). To make the comparison fair, we pre-downloaded the datasets for the ResearchAgent and made sure it could produce a machine learning model with valid test submission files for Kaggle (Huang et al., 2024). We track the average performance achieved by the learned ML pipeline under both initialization schemes, as well as the best result. After 20 optimization steps, we select the checkpoint with the best task-specific internal validation metric and submit its predictions on the Kaggle’s hidden test set to obtain a Kaggle competition score and leaderboard percentile, reported in Figure 4.

Results On both tasks, the gap between ResearchAgent (Huang et al., 2024) and our learned ML pipeline is around 11.5%-22.4% on average, and the best machine learning model produced by the learned ML pipeline surpasses 86.6% of human submissions. We notice a difference between our two initialization options. In Figure 4a, for the Spaceship Titanic dataset, asking the LLM optimizer to implement and modify a single function (train_model) is worse than implementing and modifying a set of functions. Over 5 trials, if we look at the best pipeline generated under these two initial conditions, we see a large contrast, with one initial system configuration (one-function) surpassing 72.7% of leaderboard submissions, while the other configuration (many-function) surpasses 86.6%. However, for the Housing Price dataset, the observed ordering is flipped. The one-function initial system configuration resulted in the best ML pipeline that produced a model that surpassed 75.6% of leaderboard submissions, while the many-function initial system configuration only surpassed 54.6% of submissions. The difference is noticeable both in terms of average quality and best pipeline across runs. We show some examples of the learned ML pipeline code in Figure F1.

Takeaways: Starting Artifact

Different initial systems lead to measurably different learned systems in both average and best-case performance across 5 runs.

### 5 Atari Game Case Study for the Credit Horizon Problem

Game playing has been a central focus in RL (Mnih et al., 2013; Silver et al., 2016; Brown & Sandholm, 2019). It is a natural multi-step task where a system needs to take game screen inputs from each time step and output an action for the game controller. Atari games often have dense rich reward for each step, but many tasks involve long-horizon strategic planning to get the highest possible cumulative reward. This creates a controlled testbed to compare different credit horizons: should we optimize the agent after every action using immediate rewards, or wait until a full episode completes?

Task We adopt the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE) (Mnih et al., 2013) and use object-centric Atari Environments (OCAtari) (Delfosse et al., 2024) to provide structured state representations (object positions, velocities, lives, and rewards) rather than raw screen pixels. We pass the OCAtari object dictionary directly, without additional manual feature engineering or natural-language annotation. The LLM optimizer revises a Python program of several functions (such as predict_ball, decide_move) (Figure B3). The program takes structured state input at time step t and outputs an action at. The program itself is stateless, mimicking a Markov policy that a traditional RL algorithm has to learn. Each game requires different strategies: Pong and Breakout involve predicting ball trajectories and positioning paddles, while Space Invaders requires coordinating shooting and movement decisions while avoiding enemy projectiles. We release the code3.

- Figure 5: Credit Horizon Comparison Across Games. Performance of code agents optimized with one-step (immediate reward) vs multi-step (full rollout) credit horizons across 5 trials. Both setups use agents with the same starting artifacts. We see that observing full execution traces (multi-step) is only useful in discovering better code in 4 out of 8 games, suggesting credit horizon is a design choice and can be tuned to each task.

Setup We compare two credit horizon configurations. We use Gymnasium ALE environments

{env}-NoFrameskip-v4 with action repeat 4 and sticky action probability 0.0 (Appendix B). In the one-step condition, the LLM optimizer receives a trace containing only a single observation, action and its immediate reward, and updates the Python program after every step. In the multi-step condition, the optimizer receives full rollout traces before each update; the rollout length is gamedependent and reported in Appendix B. In both conditions, we append a templated natural-language feedback string derived from the observed rewards after the trace is collected. Both conditions use the same starting agent initialization with modular function designs (e.g., predict_ball_trajectory and select_action for Pong; see Appendix B.2 for representative examples).

Experiment We run 5 trials for each game under both credit horizon conditions. We use OptoPrime (Cheng et al., 2024) as the LLM optimizer with Claude Sonnet-3.5 as the backend. For evaluation, we run the learned agent for up to 4000 steps and report the final score. The optimization runs for 30 iterations for each trial.

Results Figure 5 shows that the credit horizon can be task-dependent. Under the aggregate comparison shown in the figure, multi-step optimization outperforms one-step optimization in four of the eight games (Pong, Breakout, Space Invaders, and Asterix), while one-step optimization performs better in the other four (Freeway, Enduro, Q*bert, and Seaquest). This split suggests that credit horizon is a genuine design choice.

Wall-clock Time to Reach Best Performance (hours)

Figure 6: Training Efficiency Comparison. Deep RL training builds on CleanRL (Huang et al., 2022); PPO uses ten parallel environments for sampling while DQN and LLM use a single environment. Both PPO and DQN use batch training on a single A100 GPU. All algorithms use object-centric inputs from OCAtari. The deep RL algorithms convert this information into numeric vectors, whereas the LLM takes the raw dictionary without additional annotation. Scores are normalized to map 0% to random performance on the task and 100% to human performance. See Appendix B.5 for details.

The representative games in the appendix help interpret why the outcomes differ. Space Invaders benefits more from longer traces because effective play requires coordinating shooting and movement under delayed consequences, whereas games such as Freeway can benefit from more frequent updates based on shorthorizon feedback. Paddle-and-ball games such as Pong and Breakout sit between these extremes: they still admit relatively interpretable local geometric cues, but longer traces can remain useful because action quality depends on how returns shape future trajectories.

As a side observation, Figure 6 shows that generative optimization achieves competitive scores with substantially less wall-clock time compared to traditional Deep RL methods, despite using only a single environment instance versus 10 parallel instances for the deep RL baselines.

This finding has practical implications: even in a controlled environment like Atari with clear episodic structure, there is no universal answer to “how long should the credit horizon be?” The agent engineer must consider the causal structure of the task. For tasks where immediate feedback accurately reflects progress toward the final goal, shorter credit horizons can be sufficient and may even speed up optimization by providing more frequent updates. For tasks requiring long-term planning, longer credit horizons become necessary despite the computational cost.

Takeaways: Credit Horizon

Short credit horizons can be sufficient when immediate rewards align with long-term rewards, but longer traces are needed when they misalign and success requires coordination over time.

### 6 BigBench Extra Hard Case Study for the Experience Batching Problem

LLM agents are used for general language understanding tasks (from document processing to logical deductions). These tasks often come with a set of labeled data for the agent designer to manually tune the design and to evaluate the system. When applying LLM-based generative optimization to automate the process here (e.g., tuning the agent’s prompt), the agent engineer must decide how many execution traces (input, output, feedback triplets) should be included in the learning context per update, similar to minibatching in stochastic gradient descent. Even when the LLM’s inherent context length limit is not a problem: training on single examples can be noisy and unstable, while aggregating across large batches (with conflicting evidence) is provably hard for LLMs to reason globally (Schnabel et al., 2025).

Table 1: Test Set Performance Across Batch Sizes. Best accuracy per task is bolded; standard error shown in gray. Different tasks have different optimal batch sizes, and larger batches do not always improve performance on the full test set (175+ holdout test examples). Base model is Claude Sonnet-3.5-v2.

Task We study this problem through optimizing prompted LLM systems on BigBench Extra Hard (BBEH) (Kazemi et al., 2025), a benchmark of challenging language understanding tasks including logical reasoning (Dyck Languages, Boolean Expressions), spatial reasoning (Geometric Shapes), language understanding (Linguini, Disambiguation QA), and domain-specific question answering

(Movie Recommendation, Boardgame QA, Causal Understanding). Each task requires the agent to produce a single prompt and postprocessing code that generalizes across diverse question types within that task.

Setup We design a simple two-component agent (Figure C1): a call_llm function that takes the task query and an optimizable prompt, and an answer_extraction function that parses the LLM’s response. Both components are optimized by the LLM optimizer. We compare three batch sizes: 1, 3, and 5 examples per optimizer update. For batch size k, at each optimization iteration, we sample k training examples, execute the agent on each, collect feedback (correct/incorrect with ground truth solutions for incorrect answers), and concatenate all execution traces into a single learning context for the optimizer. We use 15 training examples, 10 validation examples, and hold out the rest of 175+ examples for testing. Each configuration runs for 15 optimization iterations across 3 trials.

Experiment We use OptoPrime (Cheng et al., 2024) as the LLM optimizer with Claude Sonnet-3.5 as the backend. We evaluate the learned agents on the held-out test set (typically 175+ examples per task) and report mean accuracy with standard errors across trials.

Results Table 1 reveals a striking pattern: the optimal batch size is task-dependent, and larger batches do not monotonically improve generalization. For some tasks, batch size 1 achieves the best test performance (Disambiguation QA: 0.537, Movie Recommendation: 0.889). For others, batch size 3 works best (Geometric Shapes: 0.389, Linguini: 0.234, Boolean Expressions: 0.238). Still others benefit from batch size 5 (Dyck Languages: 0.190, Causal Understanding: 0.531).

Figure 7 shows validation performance across optimization iterations. We observe different convergence patterns: larger batch sizes often enable faster initial learning but can plateau more quickly (e.g., Geometric Shapes), while smaller batches show noisier but sometimes more sustained improvement. The taskdependence of optimal batch size presents a practical challenge: the agent engineer cannot set a universal batch size configuration before running the learning loop. Instead, they must either perform hyperparameter search (expensive) or develop task-specific heuristics (manual effort). To check whether this sensitivity is specific to Trace, we additionally evaluate DSPy and LangGraph on the three tasks shared across frameworks. Table 2 summarizes the best minibatch size for each framework-task pair. The pattern remains the same: LangGraph obtains its best performance with batch size 5 on all three tasks, whereas DSPy favors different batch sizes across tasks. Together with the Trace results, this suggests that the minibatch-size tradeoff is not merely an artifact of the optimizer implementation. Rather, the number of examples shown to the optimizer changes the learning signal itself: larger batches provide broader coverage of task errors, while smaller batches can preserve more specific failure modes for the optimizer to address. We report details in Appendix C.6.

Takeaways: Experience Batching

Larger batches can speed up early learning but they do not reliably improve final generalization. No single batch size works across all tasks.

### 7 Conclusion and Discussion

We analyzed the difficulty of setting up a learning loop for generative optimization, identifying three key design decisions that critically influence optimization outcomes: starting artifact, credit horizon, and experience batching. Through experiments across three domains—ML agent pipelines, Atari game-playing programs, and prompt optimization on BBEH—we found no single universal recipe that works across all tasks.

Generative optimization has other degrees of freedom that we did not ablate, such as the design of the feedback oracle, the choice of LLM as the optimizer, and specific optimization procedures. We instead sought to isolate learning-loop design choices that are often treated as implementation

details but can materially change outcomes. Interestingly, these choices closely parallel long-studied concepts in machine learning. Viewed through this lens, we conjecture that with sustained research interests, generative optimization may eventually admit robust “defaults” that enable broad adoption: just as Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017) provided a broadly useful inductive bias for sequence modeling, we may discover starting artifacts for agents that are broadly optimizable across tasks; and just as Adam (Kingma & Ba, 2014) works well across a wide range of neural architectures, we may discover robust ways to structure the learning context — what traces to include, truncate, and batch — that transfer across agent designs and domains.

### A MLAgentBench Details

#### A.1 Experimental Setup

The MLAgentBench experiments instantiate the starting-artifact problem on a task that asks the LLM optimizer to improve an end-to-end machine learning pipeline. We consider two Kaggle tasks, Housing Price and Spaceship Titanic, and compare two initialization schemes: a one-function workflow and a more modular many-function workflow. In both cases, the optimizer receives the same task description and the same high-level implementation hints through docstrings; what differs is the decomposition of the initial workflow.

Our setup slightly differs from the original MLAgentBench setup (Huang et al., 2024), where the LLM agent is additionally asked to download the dataset and generate the submission file. We instead download the dataset outside the agent and generate the submission file after optimization completes. The difference is not consequential for our purposes because we want to isolate the effect of different starting artifacts on the optimization outcome.

#### A.2 Agent Design Details

The learned ML pipeline shares a similar design for both tasks with modular components for different steps of the machine learning pipeline. In the many-function initialization, the workflow is broken into components such as preprocessing, feature selection, ensemble construction, training, and prediction. This decomposition makes explicit which parts of the pipeline the optimizer is allowed to revise and gives the optimizer a more structured hypothesis class than a single monolithic train_model function. The schematic comparison below is adapted from the Housing Price implementations 4 though for both tasks, we use the same implementation.

- Figure A2 shows the feedback templates used for Spaceship Titanic and Housing Price. Table A1 summarizes the staged suggestive feedback used for both tasks. This feedback design is intended to give the optimizer more direction than a bare validation score while still leaving room for nontrivial revisions.

- A.4 Learning Dynamics and Meta-Overfitting

Train/Validation Data Splitting We create a train-validation split outside the agent and use the validation metric as the optimization signal. Kaggle test submissions are reserved for final external evaluation and are never used during optimization. We use OptoPrime (Cheng et al., 2024) as the generative optimizer and evaluate each configuration across multiple trials. Kaggle does not permit enough test submissions for the test set to be used as an optimization signal, so the held-out split within the available training data becomes the reward source for generative optimization. We provide 80% of the original training data to the agent and reserve the remaining 20% as the internal validation split used for feedback and checkpoint selection.

Optimization Details Concretely, the outer optimization loop is identical between the one-function and many-function initializations. In both cases, we fix a train-validation split outside the agent, run OptoPrime for 20 optimization steps with memory size 5, compute validation metrics after each step, and convert those metrics into a natural-language feedback string before calling the optimizer update. For the Spaceship Titanic task shown here, staged feedback thresholds and checkpoint selection both use validation F1; accuracy, precision, and recall are included in the feedback string as auxiliary

[Figure 7]

- Figure A3: One Optimization Trajectory of LLM Optimizer on the ML Pipeline. We show a single optimization trajectory from the Spaceship Titanic dataset. The feedback string reports Accuracy, F1 score, Precision, and Recall, but both staged feedback and checkpoint selection are based on validation F1. Each dot (step) represents a full execution of the training pipeline code written by the LLM optimizer with a fully trained model. We see that LLM optimizer tends to overfit to the training data and exhibits classical overfitting behavior even without numerical gradient descent.

diagnostics. The checkpoint with the best task-specific internal validation metric is then used to generate the final Kaggle submission. Thus, the main difference between the two initializations is not the outer training protocol, but the editable part of the program exposed to the optimizer.

- Figure A3 shows the learning progress of one trial of the Spaceship Titanic task. Although it resembles ordinary model overfitting at first glance, the figure reflects a different phenomenon. At each optimization step, the agent produces a new fully trained model from scratch. What increases over time is the optimizer’s tendency to discover pipeline code revisions that fit the training split at the expense of generalization. We refer to this as meta-overfitting: the generative optimizer learns to make workflow revisions that improve the immediate validation-driven objective while drifting toward brittle pipelines.

#### A.5 Representative Learned ML Pipeline Examples

We provide a snippet of the learned ML pipeline code to show how the LLM optimizer writes specific preprocessing logic (Figure F1). The full implementation is publicly available at https: //github.com/AbhinavAkkiraju/data-science-agent.

### B Atari Details

#### B.1 LLM Optimizer Experimental Setup

The per-game training configuration is reported in Table B2. Across all eight games, we use frame skipping to shorten the effective horizon and set the sticky-action probability to 0.0, since in our experiments removing sticky actions led to more stable optimization of the learned policy code.

We generate data on-the-fly using object-centric Atari Environments (OCAtari) (Delfosse et al., 2024)5, a wrapper around the Gymnasium API (Towers et al., 2025). Instead of raw pixels, the learned agent receives a structured dictionary of objects at each timestep. This representation makes the revised code more interpretable and gives the optimizer direct access to semantically meaningful state variables. The full eight-game set is Pong, Breakout, Space Invaders, Freeway, Asterix, Enduro, Q*bert, and Seaquest. To keep the appendix compact, the screenshots, feedback templates, and code examples below focus on Pong, Breakout, and Space Invaders as representative games.

The OCAtari wrapper returns game-specific dictionaries. As representative examples, Pong exposes a compact state with Player, Ball, and Enemy. Breakout additionally groups remaining bricks into row-wise lists RB/OB/YB/GB/AB/BB and records lives.

5https://github.com/k4ntz/OC_Atari

Pong In Pong, the player controls a paddle on the right side of the screen to deflect the ball into the enemy’s goal. The player scores a point if the enemy misses the ball. The game ends when one side scores 21 points.

Breakout In Breakout, the player moves a bottom paddle horizontally to deflect a ball that scores against brick walls upon contact. The brick wall consists of six rows of different colored bricks, with higher bricks worth more points. Hitting higher bricks increases ball speed and therefore the difficulty of recovery. The player wins after scoring 864 points and loses a life when the ball drops out of range.

Space Invaders In Space Invaders, the player controls a cannon at the bottom of the screen and must move left or right while firing at descending aliens. Enemy projectiles, shield usage, and firing cadence make the action-value of any single move more dependent on longer-term state evolution than in Pong or Breakout.

Reset handling is also game-specific in the code. As representative examples, Breakout automatically applies FIRE after reset so that each rollout starts with the ball in play, whereas Pong and Space Invaders use a standard reset.

Table B1: Repositories and experiment logs used for the Atari experiments.

#### B.2 Agent Design Details

Pong To succeed at Pong, the agent should accurately predict where the ball will intersect the player’s paddle plane while accounting for wall bounces. We therefore use a workflow centered on trajectory prediction and paddle control, with trainable functions such as predict_ball_trajectory() and select_action(). The initialized version returns the current ball coordinate and a random movement decision; the learned version uses a more structured geometric heuristic.

Breakout Breakout also depends on ball trajectory, but the objective is richer because paddle placement affects which bricks the ball can target next. The workflow therefore includes predict_ball_trajectory(), generate_paddle_target(), and select_paddle_action(). The initialized agent is intentionally underspecified so the optimizer must discover both reliable returns and useful targeting behavior.

Space Invaders For Space Invaders, we separate movement and firing into decide_shoot(), decide_movement(), and combine_actions(). This decomposition makes clear that the game requires concurrent control over attack and defense rather than pure interception of a moving ball.

#### B.3 Feedback Design Details

We provide game-specific feedback instructions when the agent reaches different reward regions. The goal is not only to report score, but also to guide the optimizer toward qualitatively better behavior for each game. Here, we explore a type of feedback design similar to traditional reward shaping, where we provide different feedback at different stages of the agent performance. Without the need to constantly have a human-in-the-loop to provide per-step feedback, staged feedback still allows engineers to inject dynamic information and provide granular domain-specific guidance to the LLM. In the actual optimization loop, the optimizer sees both the execution trace, which contains the raw rewards, and an appended template-based natural-language feedback string derived from those rewards. We give representative examples in Table B3 and B4. Note that the feedback is template-based, and that the performance thresholds (set on the trajectory level) triggering different messages are pre-determined by the engineer.

For each game, the left image shows the raw RGB frame and the right image shows the corresponding OCAtari (Delfosse et al., 2024) annotated frame. These examples illustrate how pixel observations are translated into object-centric state representations across diverse Atari environments.

#### B.4 Credit Horizon and Rollout Design

The main paper compares one-step and multi-step credit horizons across all eight games. In the one-step condition, the optimizer receives a trace containing a single action and its immediate reward and updates the policy after every step. In the multi-step condition, the optimizer receives a longer rollout before proposing a revision. The per-game rollout lengths are summarized in Table B2; the representative games discussed below use 400 steps for Pong, 300 for Breakout, and 25 for Space Invaders.

These values were chosen to balance two opposing forces. Longer traces reveal delayed consequences and are more faithful to the eventual control objective, but they also consume more of the optimizer’s context budget and reduce update frequency. The representative games differ meaningfully in how

[Figure 24]

- Figure B3: Representative initial systems for Atari games. We show the workflow design of different decision-making program components for three representative Atari game agents. The learned agent receives an object-centric dictionary of game state information and uses Python code to process the observation and output an action.

informative local rewards are. Pong and Breakout provide immediate geometric cues that often align with full-episode success, whereas Space Invaders requires more strategic coordination between movement, shooting, and threat avoidance. This is why the credit-horizon choice is exposed as a design decision rather than left implicit in the implementation.

#### B.5 Object-Centric Deep RL Baselines

The DQN and PPO curves in Figure 6 were produced with object-centric variants of CleanRL (Huang et al., 2022). We adapted an existing library rather than building a custom deep RL stack from scratch. In these runs, a master’s student in Computer Science implemented the object-centric baselines in roughly three days, and the subsequent training, debugging, and result collection took about two weeks. The goal was to obtain reasonable neural baselines with modest engineering effort, not to carry out an exhaustive baseline-optimization campaign.

All deep RL agents used object-centric inputs from OCAtari (Delfosse et al., 2024) rather than raw pixels. For the neural baselines, the object information was converted into numeric features and fed to multilayer perceptrons, rather than passed as the raw Python dictionary used by the LLM agent. The main implementation files were the shared object wrapper obj_atari_env.py6 together with the training scripts obj_dqn_atari.py7 and obj_ppo_cleanrl.py.8 Both inherited most algorithmic hyperparameters from the corresponding CleanRL implementations. We did not run a broad hyperparameter sweep or a systematic search over network families. The architecture changes we made were limited to a few hand-chosen MLP size adjustments that varied by game; for example, we used a smaller DQN encoder for Pong and larger ones for harder games such as

Table B4: Staged feedback for the Space Invaders agent at different performance levels.

Breakout and Space Invaders. Each run used 10M environment steps, and the experiment launch scripts ran five seeds per game.

All runs were executed on a single machine with 48 CPUs, 96 logical CPUs, and 8 NVIDIA A100SXM4-40GB GPUs. Although the machine had 8 GPUs, each individual training job used only one 40GB A100. The remaining GPUs were used to run other jobs concurrently, not to accelerate a single run with multi-GPU training. Reported wall-clock times therefore reflect straightforward single-job, single-GPU training. This is the intended interpretation of Figure 6: the comparison is against practical object-centric deep RL baselines implemented with limited tuning, rather than against the fastest achievable DQN or PPO systems. We use this to represent what a single developer can achieve in a reasonable amount of time.

For Figure 6, instead of using the total training time, which is the duration of 10M steps, we use the logged timestamps to identify when each run first reaches its highest score. Since deep RL training is not stable and performance can regress instead of monotonically improve, this captures the time until the best solution is discovered, making the reporting protocol for deep RL results more comparable to that of LLM-based runs.

(c) Space Invaders: respect firing constraints while balancing attack and defense.

- Figure B4: Representative high-level strategies discovered by the optimizer. These short excerpts show that the learned revisions do more than tune local action thresholds: Pong adds distance- and momentum-aware interception, Breakout begins to target tunnels and higher-value bricks, and Space Invaders combines action constraints with threat-aware positioning.

Figure B4 and the full code examples in Figures F2–F10 suggest that the LLM optimizer often discovers compact game-specific heuristics rather than generic code cleanups. In Pong, the learned changes become more anticipatory; in Breakout, they begin to encode targeting decisions about where the return should send the ball next; and in Space Invaders, they coordinate firing and movement under environment constraints. These representative cases make the learned code policy easier to inspect and help explain why longer credit horizons can be especially useful in games with more strategic needs.

### C BigBench Extra Hard Details

#### C.1 Experimental Setup

BigBench Extra Hard (BBEH) (Kazemi et al., 2025) is a benchmark of challenging languageunderstanding tasks. In the finalized study reported in the main paper, we use eight tasks spanning logical reasoning (Dyck Languages, Boolean Expressions), spatial reasoning (Geometric Shapes),

language understanding (Linguini, Disambiguation QA), recommendation and rule-based reasoning (Movie Recommendation, Boardgame QA), and causal reasoning (Causal Understanding).

#### Parameter Value

Training examples per task First 15 examples Validation examples per task Next 10 examples Held-out test examples per task Remaining examples (typically 175+)

Batch sizes compared 1, 3, 5 Total optimizer update steps 15 Number of trials (seeds) 3

LLM optimizer OptoPrime LLM backend Claude Sonnet-3.5-v2

Table C1: BigBench Extra Hard experimental configurations.

For each task, we form a fixed split from dataset order: the first 15 examples are used for training, the next 10 for validation, and the remainder for held-out testing. During optimization, we still perform random minibatching within the 15-example training set. At each optimizer update, we sample k training examples, where k ∈ {1,3,5} is the batch size under study, execute the current agent on each example, collect correctness feedback, and concatenate the resulting traces before sending them to the optimizer. Note that the 3 trials represent different random batch shuffling of the same training set.

#### C.2 Agent Design Details

The training code is available online9. It instantiates a simple two-part agent, matching the abstraction in the main paper. One part is a trainable prompt template that is concatenated with each question before calling the base LLM. The other is a trainable answer-extraction function that postprocesses the raw response into the exact output format expected by the evaluator.

[Figure 25]

Figure C1: Agent design for BigBench Extra Hard. The agent consists of two optimizable components: call_llm and answer_extraction. During optimization, multiple traces can be concatenated through the batchify operator ⊕ before being shown to the optimizer.

call_llm In code, this corresponds to combining the trainable prompt template with the task query and passing the resulting string to the backend LLM. The prompt is the main optimization target and is revised across updates.

answer_extraction The trainable extract_answer function parses the raw LLM response into the final answer. The initialized implementation simply splits on the string “Answer:”, which makes formatting part of the optimization problem rather than assuming it is solved in advance.

The optimizer therefore receives traces containing the input query, the prompt used, the raw response, the extracted answer, and the resulting correctness feedback. This makes BBEH a clean testbed for the experience-batching question in the main paper because the editable artifact is small, but still includes both prompting and postprocessing decisions.

9https://github.com/AgentOpt/OpenTrace/blob/experimental/examples/bbeh/bbeh_trace.py

#### C.3 Feedback Design Details

Feedback is provided by a task-agnostic guide that returns a binary score together with a short natural-language message. When the prediction is correct, the guide returns a success message; when it is incorrect, the guide reveals the expected answer and asks for a revision to the prompt or program.

The metric is also intentionally simple. For multiple-choice tasks, the evaluator extracts the last answer of the form (A), (B), etc.; otherwise it compares the predicted string to the target by exact match. This deliberately minimal design lets us study batch size without introducing task-specific reward shaping.

#### C.4 Batchify Operator Details

The batchify operator ⊕ concatenates execution traces from multiple independent examples into a single learning context. For batch size k, we construct

BatchTrace = Trace1 ⊕ Trace2 ⊕ ··· ⊕ Tracek.

Each trace contains the question, the agent’s predicted answer, and the feedback string. The concatenated batch trace is then passed to the optimizer as one context so that it can search for revisions that generalize across several examples rather than specializing to a single case.

The implementation keeps the total update budget fixed at 15 across batch sizes. Since each task has 15 training examples, this is realized by changing the number of passes over the training set: batch size 1 uses 1 epoch, batch size 3 uses 3 epochs, and batch size 5 uses 5 epochs. In all cases, the optimizer is allowed to make 15 updates per trial.

#### C.5 Task-Specific Observations

Task-dependent batch size As noted in the main text, the validation curves in Figure 7 show that the effect of batching is strongly task-dependent. Larger batches often produce smoother early learning, but they do not consistently yield the best final test performance. Smaller batches are noisier, yet sometimes continue improving for longer.

#### C.6 Additional Framework Training Details

For the DSPy study, we implemented a minimal question-answering program using dspy.Predict("question -> answer") and optimized only the instruction. Since standard DSPy COPRO optimizer does not expose the same minibatch-style learning context as our Trace experiments, we implemented a batch-aware COPRO variant. At each optimization step, the current program is run on a minibatch of training examples, and we construct a feedback context containing, the question, ground-truth answer, model answer, and correctness, for each example. Then the batch-aware COPRO optimizer proposes a revised instruction from the current instruction and the concatenated feedback. We run 15 optimization steps for each batch size and select the best intermediate program using the 10-example validation set before reporting accuracy on the held-out test set.

For the LangGraph study, we implemented the same task as a small two-node graph: one node generates a response from a trainable prompt, and a second node extracts the final answer in the format expected by the evaluator. We then optimize the graph with OptoPrime by treating the prompt and graph functions as trainable parameters because LangGraph does not provide an optimizer. At each update step, the graph is executed on a minibatch of training examples, each prediction is converted into correctness feedback against the ground truth, and the feedback strings are concatenated into a single optimization context before the optimizer update. As in the main experiments, we use 15 training examples, 10 validation examples, and the remaining examples for testing, run 15 optimization steps, and select the best candidate by validation accuracy.

Both studies use the same answer-matching rule as the main experiments: multiple-choice answers are matched by the predicted option token, while non-multiple-choice answers are matched exactly.

### D Building a Learning Loop: Extended Discussion

A learning loop can be built in many ways. Here, we discuss some of the key concepts in a learning loop by presenting the optimization problem using a graph formalism. This particular viewpoint is not commonly used in practice, but is the backbone of TextGrad (Yuksekgonul et al., 2025) and DSPy (Khattab et al., 2024). At a high level, the discussion below is analogous to how TensorFlow or PyTorch combine per-example or per-timestep computation into a larger optimization graph, for example, through reduce_mean / sum, concatenation operators such as cat / stack, or temporal unrolling across a sequence like scan.

We first discuss the intuitive notions of a learning loop and a learning context using the framework of OPTO (Optimization with Trace Oracle). We then connect that formalism back to the engineering decisions highlighted in the main paper: how the workflow is modularized, which components are made optimizable, and what form of feedback is supplied to the optimizer.

We note that there are many other forms of learning, such as building an explicit memory of past experiences (i.e., a generate-retrieve-summarize system) (Zhou et al., 2025b; Ouyang et al., 2025b), or updating LLM parameters during test time (i.e., test-time training) (Yuksekgonul et al., 2026). We focus only on learning through the lens of optimization, where agent learning happens during an optimization step, after the agent has interacted with the environment and collected sufficient experiences.

#### D.1 The OPTO Framework

OPTO (Optimization with Trace Oracle) (Cheng et al., 2024) was proposed as a unified framework for describing iterative generative optimization problems. An OPTO problem (a generalization of numerical optimization) is described by a tuple (Θ,ω,T ), where Θ is the parameter space, ω is the problem context and T is a Trace Oracle. For a parameter θ ∈ Θ, the Trace Oracle T returns a tuple (f,g) where g is a computational graph involving θ and f is a feedback signal provided to exactly one node in g – the output node.

#### D.2 Workflow Graphs and Learning Graphs

Example. We define a workflow Wθ with two functions hθ

, each controlled by its own parameter. Given an input xi, let the intermediate node be oi = hθ

,hθ

1

2

(xi) and the output be yi = hθ

1

(oi). A single execution of the workflow on xi induces a graph gi with directional edges (xi,θ1) → oi and (oi,θ2) → yi (see Figure D1), together with feedback fi attached to the output node. We refer to gi as the workflow graph produced by this execution. In other words, Wθ denotes the parameterized system, while gi denotes one concrete execution trace of that system. This already captures many workflows. For example, for a customer-support agent, hθ

2

can be an RAG database query function, where θ1 is the retrieval search query. Once the database returns a list of items, hθ

1

can be an LLM call that synthesizes those items into a final answer, and θ2 represents the tunable instruction for the answer style and content.

2

x o y f

θ1 θ2

- Figure D1: An example workflow graph gi produced by a single execution of Wθ. The graph contains input node xi, intermediate node oi, output node yi, feedback fi, and the parameter nodes θ1, θ2 that influence the output.

The workflow graph gi can be viewed as one experience of the system: one input, one execution, one output, and its associated feedback. This is often enough for single-instance optimization, but it is not enough to specify many learning problems of interest. An agent may need to generalize across multiple independent examples, or delay its update until a full sequence of interactions has finished. In such cases, the optimizer should not receive only one workflow graph; it should receive a larger graph that represents the right unit of learning.

[Figure 26]

- Figure D2: Representing different learning problems through graph templates. Each dotted rectangle denotes a workflow graph produced by a single execution of the workflow. A learning template specifies how

one or more workflow graphs are combined into the learning graph Glearn shown to the optimizer. In batch learning, independent workflow graphs are aggregated using ⊕. In episodic learning, workflow graphs are linked through temporal/environment transitions denoted by ⇒ and the result is presented to the optimizer.

We call this optimizer-facing object the learning graph, denoted by Glearn. It is constructed from one or more workflow graphs through a fixed learning template T:

Glearn = T(g1,...,gk). The template determines how individual experiences are combined before being shown to the optimizer. In the language of OPTO, Glearn is the graph returned to the optimizer for the learning problem under consideration.

#### D.3 Building Learning Graphs by Template

We now describe how to build the learning graph for common learning problems. We assume a workflow Wθ is given, where θ denotes the optimizable parameters. Without loss of generality, the workflow takes an input xi and returns an output yi = Wθ(xi), although both xi and yi may be structured objects rather than scalars. The workflow here may represent an entire software system, including multiple LLM calls, tools, retrieval steps, and decision rules. A single execution of this workflow on xi produces a workflow graph gi.

We further assume a feedback oracle that maps an execution into feedback fi, which can be numerical, textual, visual, or structured. We do not assume that the feedback is differentiable or even scalar; we only assume it contains useful information about the quality of the execution. Given a collection of workflow graphs {gi} and associated feedback {fi}, a learning template specifies how they should be combined into Glearn before being passed to the generative optimizer.

Interactive Learning Template. Here the agent learns on the fly as it interacts with the world (ShalevShwartz, 2012). At each step, it sees an input x1, outputs y1, receives feedback f1, and then updates its parameter θ. No cross-example composition is needed:

Glearn = Tinteractive(g1) = g1. This covers online-learning and bandit-style settings where a single experience already defines one update.

Batch Learning Template. In batch learning, the agent should update from several independent examples at once (Hastie et al., 2009). Consider a minibatch (xi,zi) Bi=1, where zi denotes the task-specific supervision or comparison signal associated with input xi. Executing the workflow on each example yields workflow graphs {gi}Bi=1 with outputs {oi}Bi=1 and feedback {fi}Bi=1. The batch template aggregates these experiences into one learning graph:

Glearn = Tbatch(g1,...,gB), oˆ =

B

oi.

i=1

The aggregated feedback Bi=1 fi is then attached to oˆ. Intuitively, the batchify operator ⊕ plays the role of concatenating multiple experiences into one optimizer-facing context.

Episodic Learning Template. In episodic learning, the experiences are not independent. Instead, the output of one execution influences the next observation through the environment. We therefore link the workflow graphs sequentially:

g1 ⇒ g2 ⇒ ··· ⇒ gT,

where ⇒ denotes the environment transition from one step to the next. This is the key difference from batch learning: the examples are chained causally rather than merely aggregated. After constructing this trajectory-level structure, we obtain the learning graph

##### Glearn = Tepisodic(g1,...,gT),

which can optionally include aggregated episode-level observations or feedback, such as oˆ = T i=1 oi.

Remark. Choosing the right learning template matters because it determines the learning context shown to the optimizer. If we want a parameter that generalizes across a dataset but instead optimize from one example at a time, the optimizer may become overly sensitive to presentation order. Conversely, if an agent’s actions have delayed consequences, then changing the behavior before the episode terminates can create objective mismatch. The distinction between workflow graphs, learning templates, and the resulting learning graph makes explicit what counts as one update in the learning loop.

#### D.4 The Choice of Starting Artifact

The starting artifact is not a single object, but a set of design decisions about what the LLM optimizer is allowed to edit and what prior structure it starts from. Different agentic frameworks expose different interfaces for these choices. The OPTO framework naturally maps the starting artifact to three concrete components. This decomposition is useful because it makes clear what inductive bias is being given to the LLM optimizer.

Workflow Structure and Specs. First, the engineer chooses the number of files, functions, or program components that make up the workflow, together with how they connect to one another. In OPTO, this appears as the graph connectivity and the input-output signature of each function. In other frameworks, the same choice may appear as interface specifications between files, tool schemas, or a plan for how different modules call each other. This choice matters because it determines the search space: changing one monolithic function is a different optimization problem from changing a set of coordinated components with explicit interfaces. However, this is usually overlooked in many agentic frameworks, or is mixed together with program documentation.

Program Documentation. Second, the engineer can provide docstrings, comments, instructions, or other textual descriptions that explain what each function or program component is intended to do. In OPTO, function docstrings are a natural way to instantiate this idea. In other agentic frameworks, the same role may be fulfilled by documents, instruction manuals, and READMEs. These artifacts shape the optimizer’s interpretation of the system and therefore can be changed by engineers to guide the optimizer’s search.

Initial Implementations. Third, the engineer can decide how much starter code to provide before optimization begins. At one extreme, a function may be left almost entirely unspecified except for its signature and documentation. At the other extreme, the engineer may provide a partial or even fully working implementation and ask the optimizer to improve or refactor it. In all cases, the amount of initial implementation changes what the LLMs see as the starting context and changes the initial experience, i.e., whether the program succeeds or fails.

#### D.5 The Choice of Credit Horizon

Besides deciding how the workflow graph is constructed, the rest of the design choices are about how the learning graph is constructed. The learning graph is the context that is provided as input to the optimizer. If the applicable learning template is intended to capture the long-term effects of the workflow, then the credit horizon is the number of steps to include in the learning graph.

- Figure E1: Examples of LLM-based generative optimization applied to different kinds of systems: a prompted system with a search tool (left), a more complex prompting setup with retrieval code (middle), and an end-to-end machine learning pipeline (right). We use to mark an LLM API call and to mark text or code files.

The choice of credit horizon is commonly studied in RL, though instead of directly deciding a horizon length to truncate, usually it is dynamically balanced by a discount factor (Badia et al., 2020). Direct credit-horizon truncation is, however, more commonly studied in recurrent neural networks, where truncated back-propagation through time (TBPTT) is used to truncate the gradient computation at a fixed horizon (Pascanu et al., 2013; Tallec & Ollivier, 2017; Shaban et al., 2019).

#### D.6 The Choice of Experience Batching

When a batch learning template is used, the engineer has decided that a workflow must generalize to and accommodate a diverse set of inputs and perform well to handle them. This dictates that the LLM optimizer that is used to update the workflow cannot overfit to just a single example – it must learn to reason across different examples sampled from a larger distribution. Thus, experience batching closely mimics the study of batch size in stochastic gradient descent, where the number of examples aggregated per update affects both learning dynamics and generalization (Smith et al., 2018). It is also closely related to active learning, where examples are selected to be put in a batch to make learning more efficient (Houlsby et al., 2011; Gal et al., 2017), as well as contrastive learning, where positive and negative examples are balanced in a batched setting (Chen et al., 2020; Doumbouya et al., 2025).

#### D.7 Additional Considerations: Feedback Design

Feedback design is an important part of the learning loop, but we do not attempt to treat it comprehensively in this paper. We instead point readers to prior work that explores informative and effective feedback design (Chen et al., 2024; Nie et al., 2024; Wei et al., 2025a; Xu et al., 2025). In the case-study appendices below, we mainly use staged and suggestive feedback and provide concrete examples of how it is instantiated.

Staged and Suggestive Feedback. The simplest feedback reports correctness or reward. In practice, however, the engineer often has additional freedom to vary the feedback according to performance regimes or execution states. The staged reward templates in the Atari appendix and the templates in the MLAgentBench appendix are examples of this design choice.

### E Further Discussion and Disclosures

#### E.1 Agents, Agentic Systems, and the Scope of This Paper

There is ongoing disagreement in the literature about how narrowly to define an “LLM agent.” One useful definition is that an LLM agent is a system in which the LLM repeatedly selects actions through interaction with an environment and receives feedback from that environment. Under this view, some systems optimized in this paper are plainly agents, while others are better understood as software artifacts that contain LLM components.

For the purposes of this paper, the distinction is less important than the shared optimization structure. Whether the target is a prompt, a retrieval routine, a game-playing policy, or a multi-function software workflow (see Figure E1), the engineering problem is to specify an initial artifact, execute it, collect feedback, and present the resulting evidence to a generative optimizer. This shared structure is what motivates our use of the term learning loop.

- Figure E2: Infinite nested agentic system optimization. It is easy to construct an example in which one optimizer writes the instructions for another optimizer, creating an infinite regress of optimization problems. We do not study that setting in this paper and instead focus on commonly used, finite agentic systems.

Figure E2 illustrates an interesting case of the learning-by-optimization perspective: we can always find another layer to optimize – we can construct a recursively nested optimization problem where an optimizer optimizes the prompts or instructions of an inner optimizer. Such examples are conceptually interesting, but they obscure the more practically relevant design issues studied in the main paper. The appendix therefore uses them only to clarify the scope of our claims.

- E.2 Disclosures and LLM Access Cards

- E.2.1 Large Language Model Access Card

The experiments in this paper were conducted during the period of February 2025 to April 2025. The primary model used for optimization was Anthropic Claude Sonnet-3.5-v2. Whenever we compare against other learned-agent baselines, including re-run implementations of prior methods, we use the same model endpoint during the same period whenever possible so that differences in access conditions do not dominate the comparison.

- E.2.2 Large Language Model Use for Writing

A small number of sentences and paragraphs in the paper were polished with GPT-5 after the authors had already drafted the original text. The model was used for editing and polishing rather than for generating new technical claims, results, or arguments from scratch.
