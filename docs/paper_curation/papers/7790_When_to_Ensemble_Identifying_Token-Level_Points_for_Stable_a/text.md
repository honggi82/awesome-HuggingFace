ABSTRACT

Ensembling Large Language Models (LLMs) has gained attention as a promising approach to surpass the performance of individual models by leveraging their complementary strengths. In particular, aggregating models’ next-token probability distributions to select the next token has been shown to be effective in various tasks. However, while successful for short-form answers, its application to long-form generation remains underexplored. In this paper, we show that using existing ensemble methods in long-form generation requires a careful choice of ensembling positions, since the standard practice of ensembling at every token often degrades performance. We identify two key factors for determining the ensembling positions: tokenization mismatch across models and consensus in their next-token probability distributions. Based on this, we propose SAFE, (Stable And Fast LLM Ensembling), a framework that selectively ensembles by jointly considering these factors. To further improve stability, we apply a probability sharpening strategy when the ensemble distribution becomes overly smooth, enabling the selection of more confident tokens during ensembling. Our experiments on diverse benchmarks, including MATH500 and BBH, demonstrate that SAFE outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and efficiency, with gains achieved even when ensembling fewer than 1% of tokens. The code is available at https://github.com/yoon6503/SAFE.

1 INTRODUCTION

Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across diverse domains, including mathematics (Yang et al., 2024b), coding (Guo et al., 2024) and reasoning (Yang et al., 2025; OpenAI, 2024). Despite this progress, each LLM possesses unique strengths shaped by its training recipe, and no single model dominates across all domains. As a result, combining the complementary strengths of multiple models at inference time has emerged as a promising way to surpass the performance of any individual model (Wang et al., 2025a; Yao et al., 2025; Chen et al., 2025a). Compared to training a new model that jointly integrates all such capabilities, these collaborative approaches provide a more practical and efficient pathway to superior performance.

Among various training-free collaboration methods, probability-level ensemble, which aggregates the next-token probability distributions of multiple LLMs to select the most confident token, has emerged as one of the most effective ways (Yao et al., 2025; Yu et al., 2024; Huang et al., 2024; Xu et al., 2024). It enables collaboration across diverse model architectures and effectively leverages the knowledge of multiple models embedded in their probability distributions. Consequently, it has outperformed individual models, particularly when directly answering multiple-choice or short-answer questions without reasoning.

A natural question then arises: are probability-level ensemble methods equally effective for longform generation? We find that, in long-form generation, the effectiveness of ensembling critically depends on deciding when to ensemble. Our analysis reveals that accuracy and efficiency improve when ensembling occurs at appropriate token positions, guided by two key factors: tokenization mismatch across models and their consensus in next-token probability distributions.

The first factor, tokenization mismatch across models, is crucial for stability, especially in longform generation where such mismatches occur more frequently. A mismatch arises when an ensem-

Answer

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day. They are currently on sale at 4 yogurts for $5.00. How much does he spend on yogurt over 30 days?

Problem

To determine how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we can break down the problem into several steps:

- 1. Calculate the daily yogurt consumption in terms of the sale unit: - Terry eats 2 yogurts per day. - The sale is 4 yogurts for $5.00. - Therefore, Terry consumes (2/4 = 0.5) of a sale unit per day.
- 2. Determine the daily cost based on the sale price: - Since 4 yogurts cost $5.00,

- 1 yogurt costs (5/4 = 1.25). - Therefore, 0.5 of a sale unit (which is equivalent to 2 yogurts) costs (0.5 × 1.25 = 0.625). - So, Terry spends $0.625 per day on yogurt.

- 3. Calculate the total cost over 30 days: - Terry spends $0.625 per day. - Over 30 days, the total cost is (0.625 × 30 = 18.75). Therefore, the total amount Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days is \\boxed{18.75}.

ble selects a token that conflicts with the tokenization scheme of a participating model. We refer to these tokens as OOV-like tokens because while not truly out-of-vocabulary (OOV), they force a model to predict the next token in an out-of-distribution state, often resulting in the generation of erroneous tokens, as illustrated in Figure 1. Suppose the ensemble process first generates the token So when constructing the word Sofia. However, since LLM2 tokenizes Sofia as a single token, So acts as an OOV-like token for LLM2. Conditioning on this unnatural prefix corrupts LLM2’s next-token probability distribution, leading to an erroneous output (i.e., A).˜ Such errors accumulate in long-sequence generation, degrading output quality. For example, in the case of unnatural token repetition shown in Figure 2, an initial error in generating the word Sofia propagates, causing the model to repeatedly output corrupted tokens like “A”˜ on the subsequent generation. Consequently, existing ensemble method (Yao et al., 2025) that performs ensembling at every token, suffers substantial performance degradation in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning (Wei et al., 2022), as shown in Table 1. Therefore, accounting for tokenization mismatch across models is essential to prevent the introduction of OOV-like tokens and ensure stable ensembling under CoT.

The second factor, consensus in models’ next-token probability distributions, relates to efficiency. Given the next-token probability distributions from multiple models, an ensemble operation is performed to aggregate these probability distributions. However, this introduces inefficiency when generating long sequences because the number of ensemble operations grows with sequence length. The primary expense of the ensemble operation arises from aligning next-token probability distributions defined over different vocabularies into a shared vocabulary space, a process that requires mapping across large vocabulary sets. However, when individual models’ next-token probability distributions exhibit sufficient consensus, the most confident token from the aggregated distribution can be identified without explicitly aligning distributions from multiple models. Leveraging this property, we can determine the most confident token directly from the models’ next-token probability distributions, thereby improving efficiency by skipping alignment operations.

To this end, we propose SAFE (Stable And Fast LLM Ensembling), which identifies the opportune moments for ensembling in long-sequence generation by considering the two key factors above. SAFE adopts a speculative strategy in which one model, the drafter, generates a lookahead se-

quence of tokens, while the remaining models, the verifiers, identify token-level ensemble points within that sequence. Similar to speculative decoding (Leviathan et al., 2023), this role separation reduces computational cost by limiting autoregressive generation to the drafter, whereas conventional ensemble methods require every model to do so. Specifically, SAFE iterates a three-step cycle: Generate–Verify–Ensemble. (Generate) First, the drafter produces a lookahead sequence of tokens. (Verify) Next, the verifiers examine drafter’s tokens in a single forward pass to determine whether ensembling at each token is both stable and necessary. Ensembling is triggered among the drafter’s tokens only when the following two conditions are satisfied: (i) OOV-like token is not introduced and (ii) the verifiers exhibit insufficient agreement on the token. (Ensemble) Finally, ensembling is applied only at the tokens validated in the Verify step, replacing them with the ensembled tokens. At these points, if the ensemble distribution is overly smooth, we apply a probability sharpening strategy that concentrates the probability mass onto the most plausible token for precise token selection.

Overall, we find that probability-level ensembling should occur at appropriate token positions, especially when generating long sequences with models that use different tokenizers. We then propose SAFE, a method that determines these positions by jointly considering the two key factors. Consequently, our method offers the following key advantages.

- • Efficiency: SAFE significantly reduces computational cost in two ways. First, its speculative strategy restricts costly autoregressive generation to a single drafter. Second, its selective ensembling reduces the number of ensemble operations. Therefore, SAFE can achieve inference speed comparable to individual models, even on long sequences.
- • Stability: SAFE ensures that tokens are generated from an uncorrupted ensemble distribution by preventing OOV-like tokens from being fed into models. As a result, SAFE enables stable text generation and outperforms existing ensemble methods in CoT settings.
- • Plug-and-Play: SAFE can be seamlessly integrated with existing ensemble methods by simply adding the generate-verify logic. SAFE consistently improves recent ensembling approaches across diverse model combinations.

- 2 RELATED WORK

- 2.1 LLM ENSEMBLE

LLM ensemble methods can be broadly categorized according to whether ensembling occurs after inference or during inference (Chen et al., 2025b). Research in both directions has progressed in parallel, each of which is detailed below.

- 2.1.1 ENSEMBLE AFTER INFERENCE

These approaches aggregate complete responses from multiple LLMs. While early work relied on debate-style interactions to reach consensus (Du et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2024a; Liang et al., 2024), recent focus has shifted toward stacking LLMs in cascade, parallel, or hybrid structures.

Cascade structure. Models are invoked sequentially to balance cost and performance. FrugalGPT (Chen et al., 2024b) orders models by cost, invoking more expensive models only when cheaper ones produce unreliable responses. Similarly, AutoMix (Aggarwal et al., 2024) uses self-verification to guide routing decisions, while Gupta et al. (2024) employs token-level uncertainty.

Parallel structure. In contrast to cascading, parallel ensembling runs multiple models independently and then selects the best response among them. MORE (Si et al., 2023) trains a classifier to select the optimal response by considering model expertise, confidence, and agreement across responses. LLM-Blender (Jiang et al., 2023) employs a pairwise ranker to score responses and then fuses the top-k candidates into a single answer.

Hybrid structure. Recent work has also explored combining the advantages of cascade and parallel structures. MoA (Wang et al., 2025a) proposes a framework that iteratively feeds responses from multiple models into an aggregator LLM, which consolidates them into a single answer. Within this framework, Self-MoA (Li et al., 2025) shows that using a single best-performing model can outperform using multiple distinct models in some cases, while Symbolic-MoE (Chen et al., 2025a) introduces query-adaptive model routing. Nevertheless, such frameworks require numerous LLM calls, and consolidating multiple responses remains challenging (Wang et al., 2025b).

- 2.1.2 ENSEMBLE DURING INFERENCE

In this setting, ensembling occurs during response generation, most commonly at the token level. Co-LLM (Shen et al., 2024) adopts a routing method which dynamically selects which model to use for generating each token. CoSD (Wang et al., 2025c) improves efficiency by introducing a lightweight router and integrating speculative decoding. These approaches primarily target models with identical tokenizers and rely on routing rather than aggregating probability across models.

To better exploit the collective intelligence of multiple models, another line of work explores probability-level ensemble methods. These methods average the next-token probability distributions of different models to select the most confident token. Since probability distributions are defined over heterogeneous vocabularies, prior work has focused on constructing the ensemble distribution by aligning different vocabularies across models. GaC (Yu et al., 2024) integrates probabilities by taking the union of all model vocabularies and then mapping each model’s vocabulary to this union. DEEPEN (Huang et al., 2024) projects each model’s vocabulary into a shared embedding space, merges distributions there, and maps them back to the individual vocabulary spaces. UniTE (Yao et al., 2025) demonstrates that aligning only the top-k tokens from each model is effective both in performance and efficiency. While these methods achieve strong performance in directly generating answer tokens by selecting the most confident token, they face challenges in long-sequence generation that involves reasoning. In such cases, an increase in OOV-like tokens destabilizes the ensemble, and repeated autoregressive generation across multiple models, along with the need to align their vocabulary spaces, makes such approaches inefficient. Therefore, we aim to simultaneously improve the stability and efficiency of probability-level ensembling by introducing a verification algorithm that determines when to ensemble.

- 2.2 SPECULATIVE DECODING

Speculative decoding (Leviathan et al., 2023) is a widely used technique for reducing the cost of autoregressive generation in LLMs. To alleviate the repeated forward passes required by a large model during token generation, speculative decoding replaces this process with a small drafter that speculates a sequence of candidate tokens. The large target model then performs a single forward pass to determine how many of the drafter’s proposed tokens to accept. This allows multiple tokens to be generated in a single forward pass of the target model, thereby reducing computational cost.

Recently, speculative decoding has been explored as a way to accelerate probability-level LLM ensembling. However, existing approaches (Fu et al., 2025) are limited to settings in which all models share an identical tokenizer, and cases where the drafter and target models use different tokenizers remain underexplored. In such scenarios, the drafter’s tokens cannot be properly evaluated by other participating models due to tokenization misalignment and also exhibit OOV-like issues. To address this, we extend speculative decoding to ensembles composed of models with heterogeneous tokenizers by proposing an appropriate acceptance criterion.

- Figure 3: Overview of SAFE. The drafter generates a sequence of tokens, which the verifiers retokenize with own tokenization schemes and identify the necessary ensembling point. At this position, ensembling is performed with probability sharpening applied selectively to enhance precision.

generation. To this end, we propose SAFE, an algorithm that preemptively determines optimal points for ensembling by jointly considering tokenization mismatch and consensus in next-token probability distributions. Notably, SAFE can be seamlessly integrated with existing ensemble methods.

Given k different LLMs, our method begins by dividing the models into two roles: a drafter Mdraft, which generates a lookahead sequence of tokens, and verifiers Mver, which identify the ensemble points among the drafter’s tokens. We select the best-performing model as Mdraft, while the remaining models serve as Mver. We then iterate the Generate (Section 3.1)-Verify (Section 3.2)Ensemble (Section 3.3) cycle. In each iteration, Mdraft first generates a sequence of tokens, which Mver then examine to find a token that requires ensembling. At such points, ensembling is performed to replace the token with the most confident token from the averaged distributions of all models, after which Mdraft resumes generation from the ensembled token. Figure 3 shows the overview of SAFE.

- 3.1 GENERATE

The drafter Mdraft generates a predefined number n of tokens (ti,...,ti+n−1). Producing multiple tokens rather than a single token allows SAFE to account for the different tokenization schemes of

the various models. For example, consider the word Incorrect. Suppose Mdraft generates it as three tokens (Inc, orr, ect), while other models generate it as a single token (Incorrect). If

Mdraft were to generate only the first token Inc, it would fail to capture the tokenization schemes of the other models. Therefore, at this stage, Mdraft produces a sequence of tokens to ensure compatibility with diverse tokenization schemes. The choice of n is discussed in Section 4.4.

- 3.2 VERIFY

In this step, the verifiers Mver collaboratively examine the drafter’s tokens (ti,...,ti+n−1) to identify which tokens require ensembling. Ensembling is triggered at the earliest token tj that satisfies two checks: (i) OOV-like token verification, requiring that the immediately preceding token tj−1 is not an OOV-like token, and (ii) ensemble distribution verification, requiring that tj is not the most confident token in the ensemble distribution Pens. This selective process addresses instability by preventing the introduction of OOV-like tokens and improves efficiency by skipping unnecessary ensembling. Importantly, this entire verification process is efficient, as the drafter’s tokens are processed by the verifiers in a single forward pass rather than autoregressively.

- (i) OOV-like Token Verification. This check requires that the preceding token is not an OOV-like token to prevent OOV-like tokens from corrupting the model’s next-token probability distribution. To determine whether a drafter token tj is an OOV-like token, we examine whether the token boundary up to tj aligns with the tokenization boundaries of the verifiers, ensuring that each verifier can be conditioned on valid prefix tokens. For example, in the word Incorrect, tokens such as Inc or

orr are OOV-like, but ect is not. This is because the tokenization boundaries up to Inc or orr are inconsistent with the other model’s tokenization boundary Incorrect, forcing that model to be conditioned on an invalid prefix such as Inc or Incorr. The detailed verification process are as follows. First, each verifier model LLMv ∈ Mver tokenizes the drafter’s sequence t<i+n into its own tokenization, tv<v

. Then, the drafter’s token tj is defined as an OOV-like token for LLMv if the tokenization boundary of t<j+1 does not match any boundary in LLMv’s tokenization. This condition is formally stated in Equation (1):

i+n

tj is OOV-like in LLMv ⇐⇒ ∀x ∈ [0,vi+n − 1], Decode(t<j+1) ̸= Decode(tv<x+1), (1)

where Decode(·) means merging tokens back into text. If tj is identified as OOV-like by any verifier, ensembling is not triggered at the subsequent token tj+1. Therefore, in the word Incorrect, ensembling is skipped at orr and ect, but can be triggered at the token following ect.

- (ii) Ensemble Distribution Verification. For tokens that pass OOV-like token verification, our method further checks whether the token is the most probable prediction in the ensemble distribution. To avoid the cost of repeatedly constructing the ensemble distribution, we instead verify whether a token tj is the most probable token by examining each model’s own distribution. Specifi-

cally, given LLMv’s tokenization tv<v

of the drafter’s tokens t<j, the drafter’s token tj is regarded as the most confident and ensembling is therefore skipped, if either of the following holds:

- 3.3 ENSEMBLE: SHARPENING ENSEMBLE DISTRIBUTION

In the Ensemble step, any token that passes both verifications in the Verify step is replaced with the most probable token from Pens, which is constructed as the average of all models’ probability distributions using existing ensemble methods. However, different tokenization schemes across models can scatter probability mass for the same word across multiple sub-word tokens, resulting in an overly smooth ensemble distribution (i.e., maxPens < 0.5) that hinders confident token selection. To address this, we apply a probability sharpening strategy to consolidate the diffused probability

mass. We explore two different sharpening strategies. The first adopts a heuristic approach that consolidates the diffused probability by reallocating the probability mass from variant subword tokens to their common prefix token. To prevent inflating probabilities of low-quality tokens, reallocation is applied only to the drafter’s tokens with initial probability greater than a threshold λ. Formally, the entire sharpening process is defined as:

#### Pens(ti), where Pens(tj) > λ.

#### Pens(tj) ← Pens(tj) +

ti : ti.startswith(tj)

The second strategy replaces the arithmetic mean with the geometric mean when aggregating the models’ probability distributions. Since the geometric mean strongly penalizes tokens that receive low probability by any individual model, it effectively concentrates probability mass on tokens that are consistently supported across models. These two strategies are compared in section 4.4.

After selecting the most confident token from the (potentially sharpened) ensemble distribution, the drafter resumes generation from this token.

- 4 EXPERIMENTS

This section evaluates SAFE across various benchmarks and model combinations. We begin by outlining the experimental setup, followed by the implementation details, including our KV caching strategy to further improve efficiency. We then provide an analysis of the results.

- 4.1 EXPERIMENTAL SETTINGS

Models. We select three widely used LLMs with similar capability but heterogeneous tokenization schemes: Internlm3-8BInstruct (Cai et al., 2024), Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct (Qwen et al., 2025), and EXAONE-3.5-7.8B-Instruct (An et al., 2024). Figure 4 presents the tokenization similarity across model pairs on Oxford 5000 words (Oxford, 2018), which consists of commonly used English words. As illustrated, only a small portion of the words are tokenized identically across models, with agreement rates ranging from 40% to 60%. To also evaluate ensembling on models with nearly identical tokenizations, we include two widely used LLMs with high agreement rates: Qwen2-7B-Instruct (Yang et al., 2024a) and Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct (Dubey et al., 2024). For these two models, more than 99% of Oxford 5000 words are tokenized identically. For further study, 32B-scale models are experimented in Section G.

Benchmarks. To evaluate performance across diverse domains, we use five benchmarks. For general knowledge, we adopt MMLU-redux (Gema et al., 2025), a refined subset of MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2021) that covers 30 subjects with human-annotated corrections. For mathematical reasoning, we use MATH500 (Lightman et al., 2024) and GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021). For general reasoning, we employ ARC-Challenge (Clark et al., 2018) and BBH (Suzgun et al., 2023). All benchmarks are evaluated under a zero-shot CoT setting, except for BBH, which uses 3-shot CoT. For BBH, we choose 15 subjects where the models exhibit comparable performance. Further details, including prompt templates and selected BBH subjects, are provided in Section A.

Baselines. We apply our method to two recent SOTA probability-level ensemble methods: GaC (Yu et al., 2024) and UniTE (Yao et al., 2025). GaC performs ensembling only when the main LLM’s next-token probability falls below 0.5. In contrast, UniTE represents the SOTA among methods that ensemble at every generation step. In our setting, “X + SAFE” means that the ensemble method X is applied only at the token positions that SAFE identifies as requiring ensembling.

- 4.2 IMPLEMENTATION

KV Cache Implementation. KV caching is essential for efficient generation in LLMs. However, unlike standard generation settings where previously generated tokens remain fixed, ensemble generation may replace tokens during the ensembling process, leading to inconsistencies between the

cache and the actual input sequence. Consequently, prior approaches have typically avoided implementing KV cache management, leaving it as future work. In contrast, our method updates each model’s KV cache at the end of every ensemble step to align with the ensembled output, and uses this updated cache in the next step, thereby ensuring cache consistency. We apply our KV cache management to all baselines in our experiments. Please refer to Section D for details.

Hardware and Hyperparameters. We configure our method as follows. Following the approach of UniTE (Yao et al., 2025) for selecting a primary model, we select the model with the best average performance as Mdraft. For probability sharpening, we apply the heuristic strategy in our main results with the threshold λ set to 0.1. The drafter generates tokens in chunks of 5, and all models use greedy decoding with a maximum output length of 2048. For ensembling, each model is loaded onto a separate GPU, with all experiments conducted on RTX 3090 GPUs with FP16 precision and FlashAttention-2 (Dao, 2023) enabled.

- 4.3 MAIN ANALYSIS

Results of ensembling models with substantially different tokenization schemes are shown in Table 2. We also report E/T, the percentage of tokens that undergo ensembling over the entire sequence.

SAFE improves performance with less ensembling. Overall, SAFE generally outperforms individual models, making existing ensemble methods practical even under CoT. As shown in Table 2, the baseline UniTE struggles significantly under a CoT setting, consistently underperforming individual models across all experiments. This is because it ensembles at every generation step, which increases the frequency of OOV-like tokens and consequently corrupts probability distributions. In contrast, applying SAFE enables UniTE to achieve the best performance in many cases (9/15) while reducing the ensemble frequency (E/T) to fewer than 20% of tokens. This highlights the importance of determining when to ensemble, particularly when generating long sequences with models that use heterogeneous tokenizers. GaC, on the other hand, is more robust, since it performs ensembling only when the main LLM’s probability falls below 0.5, yielding an unintended but beneficial effect of preventing the introduction of OOV-like tokens. Nevertheless, SAFE further improves GaC’s performance while reducing the number of ensemble operations.

One interesting finding is that much less ensembling is required in math datasets. When SAFE is applied with UniTE, ensembling is triggered for only 4.85% of tokens on average in math datasets, whereas it rises to 15.24% in general-domain datasets, which is nearly three times higher. We attribute this to the nature of math responses, which often contain equations or structured expressions with limited variation, leading to higher agreement among verifier models. In contrast, responses

in general-domain datasets allow for greater linguistic variability, which reduces agreement across models and thus requires more frequent ensembling.

Increasing the number of models is not always optimal. As shown in Table 2, ensembling three models does not consistently outperform two-model ensembling, whereas ensembling the top-2 best performing models typically yields the strongest results. This suggests that when model rankings are known, restricting ensembling to the top-2 models is both effective and efficient. On the other hand, when rankings are unknown, ensembling multiple comparable models provides stable, though not necessarily optimal, performance.

SAFE can be as fast as individual models. A key challenge in LLM ensembling is achieving inference speed comparable to running a single model. As shown in Figure 5, SAFE closely matches the latency of individual models when generating hundreds of tokens, regardless of the underlying ensemble method. Moreover, under the same computational resources, it significantly improves efficiency over existing ensemble methods when generating long responses. This efficiency stems from three properties of our approach. First, only Mdraft is responsible for autoregressive generation. Second, SAFE substantially reduces the number of ensembling. Third, our KV caching strategy further improves efficiency, as illustrated in Figure 5(c). We provide more comparisons in Section E.

SAFE further improves performance when ensembling models with similar tokenization. We further evaluate SAFE on models with highly similar tokenizations, where more than 99% of Oxford 5000 words are tokenized identically. As shown in Table 3, the performance drop of existing methods is less severe than in Table 2. This is because highly aligned tokenization schemes greatly reduce the occurrence of OOV-like tokens, leading to more stable ensembling. Nevertheless, applying SAFE to existing methods consistently improves performance, yielding over a 9% gain on MATH500 compared to the best-performing individual model.

- 4.4 ABLATION STUDY

We conduct ablation studies on probability sharpening strategy and the drafter’s sequence length.

Probability sharpening. As shown in Table 4, incorporating probability sharpening consistently improves performance across benchmarks and ensemble methods. This result highlights that sharpening is beneficial for choosing an accurate token when the ensemble distribution becomes overly smooth. To further examine whether different sharpening strategies provide similar benefits, we conduct additional experiments by varying the threshold λ in our heuristic sharpening method and

by applying the geometric mean. As demonstrated in Table 5, multiple sharpening strategies offer consistent gains. The geometric mean generally yields strong performance, which we attribute to its ability to gather the probability mass dispersed across multiple tokens by individual models and concentrate it on the token with the highest consensus among the models. However, considering that the arithmetic mean is widely used and often required, our heuristic strategy remains useful in such settings. Therefore, we leave the specific choice of sharpening method as a flexible design decision, allowing each ensemble method to adopt the sharpening strategy most suitable for its characteristics. The core takeaway is the importance of mitigating an overly smooth ensemble distribution. Regarding the threshold λ used in our heuristic sharpening strategy, the performance does not change drastically across different values. However, setting the threshold too high reduces the number of tokens subject to sharpening, which in turn diminishes its effectiveness.

Drafter’s sequence length. Table 6 presents the ablation on drafter sequence length. Generating short sequences may fail to capture differences in tokenization across models, causing slight performance drops. Conversely, generating overly long sequences does not harm accuracy but may reduce efficiency, as shown in Figure 10. This is because longer sequences force the drafter to regenerate tokens more often from the ensembled token. A length of 5 provides the best balance between accuracy and efficiency.

- 5 CONCLUSION

In this paper, we examined probability-level ensemble methods for long-form generation and showed that deciding when to ensemble is critical for both accuracy and efficiency. To this end, we proposed SAFE, a generate-verify-ensemble framework that triggers ensembling only when safe and necessary, guided by tokenization mismatch and consensus in models’ next-token probability distributions. SAFE further improved accuracy via probability sharpening to mitigate smooth ensemble distribution, and our KV cache implementation enabled much faster ensembling in long-form generation. Experiments demonstrated that SAFE outperforms existing methods with only a few ensemble operations across widely used 7B-scale model combinations. We believe SAFE offers a practical step toward making LLM ensembling both robust and deployable in real-world applications.

In this section, we provide additional experimental details. We first present the exact prompts and BBH subjects used in our experiments, followed by an explanation of baseline selection.

Prompts For multiple-choice questions, we follow the template in Figure 6. For math datasets, we use the template in Figure 7.

Question: [question]

[question] Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \boxed{}.

Figure 7: Prompt template used for math problems.

BBH subjects In our main experiments (Table 2), we filter BBH subjects to include only subjects where models exhibit comparable performance. This choice is based on the observation of UniTE (Yao et al., 2025) that ensemble is meaningful when the base models exhibit similar performance levels. The chosen 15 BBH subjects are: boolean expressions, causal judgement, date understanding, disambiguation qa, formal fallacies, logical deduction three objects, movie recommendation, navigate, penguins in a table, reasoning about colored objects, ruin names, salient translation error detection, snarks, temporal sequences, and tracking shuffled objects three objects.

Baseline selection As our purpose is to enhance the stability and efficiency of probability-level ensemble methods, we focus on recent, state-of-the-art probability-level ensemble methods as baselines. Specifically, we consider two representative methods that differ in when ensembling is performed. The first is GaC, which ensembles only when the main LLM’s probability falls below 0.5. To the best of our knowledge, this is the only work that does not ensemble at every token generation. The second is UniTE, which achieves state-of-the-art performance among methods that ensemble at every generation step. By applying SAFE to both methods, we demonstrate its versatility and its effectiveness in determining when to ensemble.

- B LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE WORK

SAFE does not always guarantee superior performance compared to the best-performing individual model. As shown in Table 2, in a few cases SAFE performs slightly worse than the best-performing individual models. We believe this is because the most confident token in the ensemble distribution is not necessarily the optimal choice, as poorly performing models can distort the ensemble distribution by elevating an incorrect token as the most confident. Nevertheless, SAFE generally outperforms individual models by ensuring a stable ensemble distribution when applied to ensembles of models with similar capability.

Additionally, our experiments are limited to non-reasoning models. Extending SAFE to reasoning models (Yang et al., 2025; Guo et al., 2025) would be a promising direction, as reasoning models have recently gained significant attention.

- C CORRECTNESS OF ENSEMBLE DISTRIBUTION VERIFICATION

Theorem 1 guarantees that applying the ensemble distribution verification criteria does not compromise accuracy.

Theorem 1. Let t<j denote the drafter’s prefix. For each verifier model LLMv ∈ Mver, let tvv

j

is the LLMv’s tokenization of t<j. Let Pv be the nexttoken probability distribution of LLMv. Suppose (i) all verifier models unanimously agree on the next token tvv

be its next token, aligned such that tv<v

j

, where tvv

= arg maxt Pv(t | tv<j) for all v, or (ii) their average probability in tvv

exceeds 21:

- 1

- 2

1 |Mver ∪ Mdraft| v∈M

| tv<v

Pv(tvv

) >

.

j

j

ver∪Mdraft

Then tj is the token selected by the ensemble, i.e., tj = arg maxt Pens(t | t<j), where Pens is the ensemble distribution.

Proof. Define the ensemble distribution as average of all models’ distributions which is aligned with Mdraft’s tokenization

1 |Mver| + 1 v∈M

Pens(tj | t<j) ≜

| tv<v

Pv tvv

### (i) Unanimous consensus across verifiers. If for all v ∈ Mver we have tvv

= arg maxt Pv(tj | tv<v

j

), then for any token u, Pv(tvv

j

| tv<v

) ≥ Pv(u | tv<v

) for all v. Since tvv

j

j

j

is aligned with tj for all v, averaging over v preserves the inequality:

j

1 |Mver| + 1 v

| tv<v

Pv(u | tv<v

Pv(tvv

Pens(tj | t<j) =

) ≥

) = Pens(u | t<j).

j

j

j

Hence, tj = arg maxt Pens(t | t<j).

### (ii) Average probability above one half. Assume

1 |Mver| + 1 v∈M

| tv<v

Pv(tvv

) > 12.

Pens(tj | t<j) =

j

j

ver∪Mdraft

Because Pens(· | t<j) is a probability distribution, t Pens(t | t<j) = 1. Thus, no other token u ̸= tj can have Pens(u | t<j) ≥ Pens(tj | t<j), since two distinct tokens cannot both exceed 1/2. Therefore, tj = arg maxt Pens(t | t<j).

In either case (i) or (ii), the ensemble selects tj, proving the claim.

- Figure 8: Our KV cache management. The cache is pruned to ensure alignment with the ensembled output.

- D DETAILS OF OUR KV CACHE MANAGEMENT

While KV caching is essential for generating long responses, it introduces a challenge in ensemble settings because the token selected by the ensemble may differ from the tokens generated by individual models. As illustrated in Figure 8, the drafter initially generates The answer is Incorrect, but after ensembling the output becomes The answer is Correct. In this case, the drafter’s KV cache, which contains states for the discarded token Incorrect, must be updated. To resolve this inconsistency, we prune each participating model’s KV cache by a fixed buffer at the end of every ensemble step. This pruning ensures that each model’s KV cache is consistent with the actual input sequences before producing the next token.

- E LATENCY COMPARISON

We present additional latency comparisons on general-domain datasets, where the proportion of ensembled tokens is higher than in math datasets. Figure 9 shows the latency of SAFE on MMLUredux dataset. As illustrated, SAFE substantially reduces latency compared to existing ensemble methods and achieves speeds comparable to individual models when generating hundreds of tokens, even in general-domain tasks. These results highlight the practical applicability of SAFE, demonstrating that it enables efficient ensembling across diverse domains.

MMLUredux∗ includes only 21 subjects, excluding 9 subjects where Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct largely outperforms EXAONE-3.5-32B-Instruct by more than 10%, making ensembling less meaningful. As

shown in the table, applying SAFE to existing ensemble methods consistently outperforms the baselines, demonstrating its effectiveness on larger-scale models. The 9 subjects excluded in MMLUredux∗ are: college chemistry, college mathematics, college physics, formal logic, electrical engineering, high school chemistry, professional accounting, clinical knowledge, and econometrics.

- H RELAXED ACCEPTANCE THRESHOLD

In the Ensemble Distribution Verification step, the acceptance threshold can be relaxed to support various scenarios, such as sampling or weighted combinations of probability distributions, rather than simple averaging. First, if the ensemble distribution is defined as a weighted sum of the models’ next-token probability distributions, the second condition of Ensemble Distribution Verification becomes:

• (Average probability above one half) If LLM

v∈Mver∪Mdraft wvPv(tvv

j

| tv<v

j

) > 21, we skip ensembling at tj, where wv is the weight assigned to LLMv and v wv = 1.

If we wish to use sampling rather than greedy decoding, we can incorporate speculative sampling (Leviathan et al., 2023) into our framework. In this case, we do not use the first condition (Unanimous consensus among verifiers), and the second condition is relaxed as follows:

• (Average probability above one half) → (Speculative sampling) We skip ensembling at tj with probability min(1, PPens(tj|t<j)

draft(tj|t<j)). Similar to greedy decoding setup, Pens(tj|t<j) is derived as:

Pens(tj|t<j) =

1 |Mver ∪ Mdraft| LLM

v∈Mver∪Mdraft

Pv(tvv

j

| tv<v

j

),

where tvv

j

is the token corresponding to tj under LLMv’s tokenization.

- I FURTHER DISCUSSION OF OOV-LIKE TOKENS

In this section, we provide a more detailed explanation about OOV-like tokens, which we use to determine whether tokenization mismatch occurs. OOV-like tokens are defined as tokens that can corrupt the next-token probability distribution of a participating model due to differences in tokenization across models. As described in Section 3.2, whether a drafter token is classified as OOV-like is determined by checking whether the token boundary up to that token aligns with the tokenization boundaries of the verifiers.

One similar concept to OOV-like token is non-canonical tokenization, which refers to any tokenization other than the canonical tokenization for a given model. Several studies (Cao & Rimell, 2021; Geh et al., 2024; Chatzi et al., 2025; Vieira et al., 2025) have explored the use of non-canonical tokenizations in generation within a single LLM. However, we highlight two important distinctions between OOV-like tokens and non-canonical tokenizations. First, OOV-like tokens are defined

strictly at the token level. For example, consider the sequence “Hello, world”. If (Hello, world) is the canonical tokenization, then alternative tokenizations such as (Hell, o, world) or (Hello,

w, orld) would be considered non-canonical tokenizations. However, we do not treat an entire tokenization like (Hell, o, world) as an OOV-like case. Instead, we identify only the specific mismatched tokens within such non-canonical tokenizations, such as Hell or w, as OOV-like tokens. Second, OOV-like tokens consider only the tokenizations used by the participating models, whereas non-canonical tokenization is a broader concept that encompasses all possible tokenizations of a sequence. For example, if the participating models tokenize “Hello” in only one way, (Hello), then no OOV-like token exists. In contrast, non-canonical tokenization includes any tokenization that can compose Hello, such as (H, e, l, l, o) or (He, ll, o), regardless of whether it is produced by the models. These distinctions directly relate to how we handle tokenization mismatch. We only assess mismatch at the token level, using only tokenizations of participating models. These two distinctions clearly represent differences from prior work on non-canonical tokenization.

- J COMPARISON WITH METHODS THAT ENSEMBLING AT A SPAN-LEVEL

We discuss how our method differs from methods that ensemble at a larger-granularity, such as span-level ensembling, in addressing tokenization mismatch. Recently, several approaches (Xu et al., 2025; Liu et al., 2025) have proposed ensembling at a larger granularity, such as a set of words, to bypass the tokenization mismatch problem when ensembling LLMs that use heterogeneous tokenizers. These methods avoid tokenization mismatch by not performing ensembling at the token level and instead ensemble only at the span level. As a result, ensembling cannot occur inside a span, thereby sacrificing token-level probability information. In contrast, our method addresses tokenization mismatch within token-level ensembling. Our method resolves OOV-like issues by identifying token-level positions in the drafter’s tokens where no mismatch occurs, and only these positions are considered valid candidates for ensembling. This allows ensembling to take place within a span while avoiding OOV-like issues, providing greater flexibility in where ensembling can occur.

- K QUALITATIVE RESULTS

In this section, we present qualitative results of SAFE. Tables 8 to 11 compare responses from existing ensemble methods with those obtained when SAFE is applied. As shown in Table 8, SAFE can successfully yield the correct solution even when individual models fail to produce the correct answer or reasoning. Tables 8 and 11 further illustrate how existing ensemble methods suffer from repeated generation of erroneous tokens due to the introduction of OOV-like tokens. Finally, Tables 9 and 10 highlight cases where existing ensemble methods generate incorrect reasoning that leads to wrong answers.

- L LLM USAGE We used the LLM solely for the purpose of polishing the writing.

Question Sofia and Tess will each randomly choose one of the 10 integers from 1 to 10. What is the probability that neither integer chosen will be the square of the other? (A) 0.64 (B) 0.72 (C) 0.81 (D) 0.95

Answer (D) 0.95 Internlm38B-Instruct

To determine the probability that neither integer chosen by Sofia and Tess will be the square of the other, we can follow these steps: 1. Identify the squares of the integers from 1 to 10: The squares of the integers from 1 to 10 are: [12 = 1,22 = 4,32 = 9] So, the squares are 1, 4, and 9. 2. Determine the total number of possible outcomes: Each of Sofia and Tess can choose any of the 10 integers, so the total number of possible outcomes is: [10 × 10 = 100] 3. Count the number of outcomes where one integer is the square of the other: We need to count the pairs ((a, b)) where (a) is the square of (b) or (b) is the square of (a). The pairs are: [(1,1),(1,4),(1,9),(4,1),(4,4),(4,9),(9,1),(9,4),(9,9)] There are 9 such pairs. 4. Calculate the number of outcomes where neither integer is the square of

the other: [100 − 9 = 91] 5. Calculate the probability: [10091 = 0.91] However, none of the provided answer choices match 0.91. ... The answer is C.

Qwen2.57B-Instruct

To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that neither of the two chosen integers is the square of the other. First, let’s identify the squares of integers from 1 to 10: (12 = 1),(22 = 4),(32 = 9) So, the only pairs of numbers in the range from 1 to 10 where one number is the square of the other are:(1, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (9, 3), (9, 9) There are 5 such pairs. Since each person can independently choose any of the 10 integers, there are a total of (10 × 10 = 100) possible outcomes when both Sofia and Tess make their choices. Next, we calculate the number of outcomes where at least one of the chosen integers is the square of the other. This includes the 5 pairs listed above and their reverses (since if (4, 2) is a pair, so is (2, 4)). However, since (1, 1), (4, 4), and (9, 9) are symmetric, they are already counted once. Therefore, we have:(1, 1) - 1 way, (4, 2) and (2, 4) - 2 ways, (4, 4) - 1 way, (9, 3) and (3, 9) - 2 ways, (9, 9) - 1 way. This gives us a total of (1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 7) pairs where one number is the square of the other. Thus, the number of outcomes where neither integer is the square of the other is (100 − 7 = 93). The probability that neither integer chosen will be the square

of the other is therefore: [10093 = 0.93] However, this does not match any of the provided options exactly. ... Given the options, the closest match to our calculated

probability of 0.93 is 0.95. The answer is (D).

UniTE To determine how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we can break down the problem into several steps: 1. Calculate the daily yogurt consumption in terms of the sale unit: Terry eats 2 yogurts per day. The sale is 4 yogurts for $5.00.

Therefore, Terry consumes (24 = 0.5) of a sale unit per day. 2. Determine the daily cost based on the sale price: Since 4 yogurts cost $5.00, 1 yogurt costs (5.400 = 1.25). - Therefore, 0.5 of a sale unit (which is equivalent to 2 yogurts) costs (0.5× 1.25 = 0.625). So, Terry spends $0.625 per day on yogurt. 3. Calculate the total cost over 30 days: Terry spends $0.625 per day. Over 30 days, the total cost is (0.625 × 30 = 18.75).

Then the expression becomes: x2 + x + 1. Notice that this expression can be rewritten using the identity for the square of a binomial: x2 + x + 1 = (x + 1)2 − x. Substituting x = 99 back into the expression, we get: 992 + 99 + 1 = (99 + 1)2 − 99. Simplifying inside the parentheses, we have: 99 + 1 = 100. So the expression becomes: 1002 − 99. Now, we know that 1002 = 10000, so the expression simplifies to: 10000 − 99 = 9901. Therefore, the value of 992 + 99 + 1 is

Answer (D) Qwen2.57B-Instruct

To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the solubility of a compound and its solubility product constant Ksp. 1. Dissociation of Lead Iodide PbI2: PbI2(s) ⇌ Pb2+(aq) + 2I−(aq) 2. Solubility in Water: Given that 1.0 mmol (or 1.0 × 10−3mol) of PbI2 dissolves in 1.00 L of pure water, we can determine the concentrations of the ions: The concentration of Pb2+ is 1.0 × 10−3M. The concentration of I− is 2 × 1.0 × 10−3 = 2.0 × 10−3M. 3. Solubility Product Constant Ksp: The expression for the solubility product constant Ksp for PbI2 is: Ksp = [Pb2+][I−]2 Substituting the concentrations: Ksp = (1.0 × 10−3)(2.0 × 10−3)2 = (1.0 × 10−3)(4.0 × 10−6) = 4.0 × 10−9 Therefore, the solubility product, Ksp, for lead iodide at 25°C is 4.0 × 10−9.

To determine the solubility product constant Ksp for lead iodide PbI2, we need to follow these steps: 1. Understand the Dissociation Reaction: Lead iodide dis-

sociates in water as follows: PbI2 → Pb2+ + 2I− 2. Determine the Concentrations: Given that the maximum amount of PbI2 that can dissolve in 1.00 L of water is 1.0 mmol, we can find the molar concentrations of Pb2+ and I− ions produced. Since 1 mmol of PbI2 dissociates into 1 mmol of Pb2+ and 2 mmol of I−: [Pb2+] = 1.10.mmol0 L = 1.0 mmol/L = 1.0 × 10−3 M, [I−] = 2×11..00mmolL = 2.0 mmol/L = 2.0 × 10−3 M 3. Write the Expression for Ksp: The solubility product constant expression for PbI2 is: Ksp = [Pb2+] · [I−]2 4. Substitute the Concentrations into the Ksp Expression: Ksp = (1.0 × 10−3) · (2.0 × 10−3)2 = (1.0 × 10−3) · (4.0 × 10−6) = 4.0 × 10−9 Therefore, the solubility product constant Ksp for lead iodide PbI2 at 25°C is 4.0 × 10−9. The answer is (D).

To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the solubility product constant Ksp and the solubility of a compound. For lead iodide PbI2, the dissociation in water can be represented as: PbI2 ⇌ Pb2+ + 2I− Given that the maximum amount of PbI2 that can be dissolved in 1.00 L of pure water is 1.0 mmol (which is 1.0 × 10−3mol, we can determine the concentrations of the ions in solution. 1. Determine the concentration of Pb2+ ions: Since 1.0 mmol of PbI2 dissociates into 1.0 mmol of Pb2+ ions, the concentration of Pb2+ ions is: [Pb2+] = 1.0 × 10−3M 2. Determine the concentration of I− ions: Each mole of PbI2 dissociates into 2 moles of I− ions. Therefore, the concentration of I− ions is: [I−] = 2 × 1.0 × 10−3M = 2.0 × 10−3M 3. Calculate the solubility product constant Ksp: The expression for Ksp for PbI2 is: Ksp = [Pb2+][I−]2. Substituting the concentrations we found: Ksp = (1.0 × 10−3)(2.0 × 10−3)2 = (1.0 × 10−3)(4.0 × 10−6) = 4.0 × 10−9 Therefore, the solubility product, Ksp, for lead iodide at 25°C is 4.0 × 10−9.
