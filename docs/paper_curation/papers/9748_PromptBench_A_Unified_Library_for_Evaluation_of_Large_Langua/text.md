### Abstract

The evaluation of large language models (LLMs) is crucial to assess their performance and mitigate potential security risks. In this paper, we introduce PromptBench, a unified library to evaluate LLMs. It consists of several key components that can be easily used and extended by researchers: prompt construction, prompt engineering, dataset and model loading, adversarial prompt attack, dynamic evaluation protocols, and analysis tools. PromptBench is designed as an open, general, and flexible codebase for research purpose. It aims to facilitate original study in creating new benchmarks, deploying downstream applications, and designing new evaluation protocols. The code is available at: https://github.com/microsoft/promptbench and will be continuously supported.

Keywords: Evaluation, large language models, framework

### 1 Introduction

Large language models (LLMs) are revolutionizing aspects of human life and society, such

- as medical diagnostics (McDuff et al., 2023; Thirunavukarasu et al., 2024), and educational tools (Ho et al., 2023). Evaluation is of paramount importance to understand the true capabilities of LLMs, mitigate potential risks, and eventually, benefit society further (Eisenstein, 2023; Chang et al., 2023). Recent efforts have evaluated LLMs from diverse aspects (Hendrycks et al., 2021; Liang et al., 2022; Zheng et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023c; Huang et al., 2023; HuggingFace, 2023). Among the findings, one of the most important is that current LLMs are sensitive to prompts (Wang et al., 2023b), vulnerable to adversarial prompt attacks (Zhu et al., 2023b), and exposed to testset data contamination (Willig et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2023b; Zhu et al., 2023a), which pose severe security and privacy issues (Wang et al., 2023a; Simmons, 2022). On top of that, there have been various prompt learning algorithms developed based on different evaluation metrics, such as BDPL (Diao et al., 2022), GrIPS (Prasad et al., 2022) and Plum (Pan et al., 2023). Given the increasing popularity of LLMs, it is indispensable to develop a unified codebase to enable easy, fast, and flexible evaluation of large foundation models.

There are existing libraries such as LlamaIndex (Liu, 2022), semantic kernel (Microsoft, 2023), and LangChain (Chase, 2022). LlamaIndex and LangChain enhance LLM applications by incorporating databases and various data sources. Semantic Kernel aims to

merge AI services with programming languages for versatile AI app development. Evalharness (Gao et al., 2023) offers a comprehensive framework for evaluating generative language models. Zeno (Zeno, 2023) is an AI evaluation platform supporting interaction and visualization, but it is not easy to customize. LiteLLM (BerriAI, 2023) implements a unified API call for different LLM service prodiders.

This paper introduces PromptBench, a unified Python library to evaluate LLMs from comprehensive dimensions. It is designed to fill the gaps current libraries have, offering comprehensive support not only for standard model evaluations but also for advanced scenarios including adversarial prompt attacks and dynamic evaluations. Its extensible architecture allows for the incorporation of new evaluation protocols, addressing the limitations found in other tools. The detailed comparisons are shown in Appendix A, highlighting how PromptBench provides a more complete toolkit for the nuanced evaluation of language models, especially in research contexts where adaptability and thoroughness are paramount. It consists of a wide range of LLMs and evaluation datasets, covering diverse tasks, evaluation protocols, adversarial prompt attacks, and prompt engineering techniques. As a holistic library, it also supports several analysis tools for interpreting the results. Our library is designed in a modular fashion, allowing researchers to easily build evaluation pipelines for their own projects. We open-source PromptBench with comprehensive documents and tutorials1 to support easy, flexible, and collaborative evaluation. We believe PromptBench could enhance our understanding of LLMs and spur new research within the community.

### 2 PromptBench

PromptBench can be easily installed either via pip install promptbench or git clone. In this section, we briefly introduce the components of PromptBench and how to use it to build an evaluation pipeline for LLMs. An overview of PromptBench is shown in Figure 1.

#### 2.1 Components

Models. PromptBench supports both open-source and proprietary LLMs and VLMs and it is open to add more. Currently, it supports a diverse range of LLMs and VLMs, ranging from

- 1. https://promptbench.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

Llama2 series (Touvron et al., 2023b), Mixtral series (Jiang et al., 2024), LlaVa series (Liu et al., 2023a) to GPT series (OpenAI, 2023a,b). PromptBench provides unified LLMModel and VLMModel interfaces to allow easy construction and inference of a model with specified max generating tokens and generating temperature. The interfaces also support customized models, including those that have been fine-tuned for specific applications. More details of the supported models are shown in Appendix B.1.

Datasets and tasks. PromptBench comprises a wide array of tasks, currently supporting diverse challenges across 12 tasks and 22 public datasets, with the capacity for additional expansions. The supported tasks include fundamental NLP tasks such as sentiment analysis, grammar correctness, and duplicate sentence detection, as well as complex challenges involving natural language inference, multi-task knowledge, and reading comprehension. It also covers specialized areas like translation, mathematical problem-solving, and various forms of reasoning—logical, commonsense, symbolic, and algorithmic. For detailed descriptions of each dataset and specific task configurations (see Appendix B.2). The unified DatasetLoader interface facilitates easy and customizable loading and processing of these datasets, enhancing the usability and flexibility of PromptBench.

Prompts and prompt engineering. PromptBench offers a suite of 4 distinct prompt types, and additionally, users have the flexibility to craft custom prompts using the Prompt interface. Task-oriented prompts are structured to clearly delineate the specific task expected of the model, whereas role-oriented prompts position the model in a defined role, such as an expert, advisor, or translator. These prompt categories are adaptable for both zero-shot and few-shot learning contexts, offering diverse application possibilities. Moreover, PromptBench currently includes 6 prominent prompt engineering methods, details can be found in Appendix B.4.2. Our framework is not only equipped for the easy integration of these existing techniques through the prompt engineering module but is also actively evolving to encompass a broader spectrum of prompt engineering methods, enhancing its adaptability in varied evaluation scenarios.

Adversarial prompt attacks. To facilitate the investigation of LLMs’ robustness on prompts, PromptBench integrates 4 types of attacks: (1) character-level attacks (Li et al., 2019; Gao et al., 2018), which manipulate texts by introducing typos or errors to words; (2) word-level attacks (Jin et al., 2019; Li et al., 2020), which aim to replace words with synonyms or contextually similar words to deceive LLMs; (3) sentence-level attacks (Ribeiro et al., 2020; Naik et al., 2018), which append irrelevant or extraneous sentences to the end of prompts, intending to distract LLMs; (4) semantic-level attacks (Zhu et al., 2023b), which simulate the linguistic behavior of people from different countries. Details can be found in Appendix B.4.3 These attacks can be easily called via the prompt attack interface. It also supports the usage of curated adversarial prompts to efficiently evaluate robustness.

Different evaluation protocols. By default, PromptBench supports the standard protocol, i.e., the direct inference. PromptBench further supports dynamic (Zhu et al., 2023a) and semantic (Liu et al., 2023b) evaluation protocols by dynamically generating testing data. It is open to integrate more new protocols to avoid data contamination.

Analysis tools. Finally, PromptBench offers a series of analysis tools to help researchers analyze their results. Particularly, it support sweep running to get the benchmark results. Then, attention visualization analysis can be done through the utils interface.

PromptBench also supports word frequency analysis to analyze the words used in attacks as well as defense analysis by integrating word correction tools.

#### 2.2 Evaluation pipeline

PromptBench allows easy construction of an evaluation pipeline via four steps. Firstly, specify task and then load dataset via pb.DatasetLoader. PromptBench offers a streamlined one-line API for loading the desired dataset. Secondly, users can customize LLMs using the pb.LLMModel, which provides integrated inference pipelines compatible with most LLMs implemented in Huggingface. Thirdly, the prompt for the specified dataset and task is defined via pb.Prompt. Users have the option to input a list of prompts for evaluation and performance comparison. In cases where no prompts are supplied, our default prompts for the dataset are utilized. Finally, the pipeline requires the definition of input and output processing functions via class InputProcess and class OutputProcess defined in pb.utils.dataprocess, as well as the evaluation function via pb.metrics. The detailed introduction of the components are shown in Appendix B.

#### 2.3 Supported research topics

Compared to current evaluation libraries, PromptBench is designed mainly for research purpose, thus it is easy to customize for different topics. As shown in Figure 1(b), it supports different evaluation topics from the research community including benchmarks, scenarios, and protocols. In benchmarks research, it supports standard natural language understanding, natural language generation, and reasoning tasks. It can also be extended to support research on AI agent and interdisciplinary study. In scenario research, it supports adversarial and out-of-distribution evaluation, and can also support other topics such as hallucination and bias by changing the metrics and DatasetLoader interface. In protocol, it naturally supports standard and dynamic evaluation, and can further be verified by including measurement theory. PromptBench offers three leaderboards to allow easy comparison: adversarial prompt attack, prompt engineering, and dynamic evaluation, as shown in Appendix C. Researchers are welcome to submit new results to our platform. Extensibility is shown in Appendix D that allows convenient extension of the framework.

### 3 Conclusion and Discussion

We presented PromptBench, a unified framework for LLMs evaluation, designed in a modular fashion to build evaluation pipelines with various models, tasks, and prompts. It supports research in prompt engineering, adversarial attacks, and dynamic evaluation. PromptBench is the first step in assessing and exploring the capabilities of current LLMs. We believe our benchmark and analysis will inform the design of more robust, human-aligned models. In the future, new datasets, evaluation protocols, prompt variations, and analytical tools will be added into PromptBench. We also welcome any contributions for PromptBench.

Despite its versatility, PromptBench has limitations. It may not cover all evaluation scenarios, and some metrics might miss nuanced performance differences. The framework’s effectiveness depends on the quality and diversity of datasets and prompts. Addressing these limitations is a priority for our ongoing and future work.

DyVal synthesized seven distinct reasoning tasks, including: (1) Mathematics, focusing on arithmetic calculations and linear equation solving; (2) Logical Reasoning, involving boolean, deductive, and abductive logic; and (3) Algorithmic Analysis, covering reachability and the maximum sum path problem. MSTemp (Liu et al., 2023b) stands for the semantic evalaution protocol which generate out-of-distribution samples by relying on evlauator LLMs and word replacement.

#### B.4 Prompts

- B.4.1 Prompts

Our study examines four prompt categories, differentiated by their intended function and the required number of labeled samples. Task-oriented prompts are designed to clearly define the model’s task, prompting it to generate outputs relevant to the task using its inherent pre-training knowledge. In contrast, role-oriented prompts position the model as a particular entity, like an expert, advisor, or translator, thereby subtly guiding the expected output format and behavior through the assumed role. Both categories can be adapted for zero-shot and few-shot learning contexts. We randomly choose three training set examples for each task to form the few shot examples. Examples of various prompt types are illustrated in Table 2.

- B.4.2 Prompt Engineering

Prompt engineering is a process of structuring and optimizing prompts to efficiently use AI models. Methods in prompt engineering , such as chain-of-thought (Wei et al., 2023), generated knowledge prompting (Liu et al., 2022) and so on, help improve reasoning ability and task performance of AI models. We implement 6 prominent prompt engineering methods:

- • Chain-of-Thought (Wei et al., 2023): This method involves breaking down complex, multi-step problems into smaller, intermediate steps, enabling Models to tackle more intricate reasoning tasks. Chain-of-Thought differs from standard few-shot prompting by not just providing questions and answers but prompting the model to produce intermediate reasoning steps before arriving at the final answer.
- • Zero-Shot Chain-of-Thought (Kojima et al., 2022): Zero-Shot Chain of Thought improves Chain of Thought by simplifying the prompting process. The key innovation in

##### Table 2: Examples of 4 types of prompts.

Task oriented

Determine if the given pair of statements can be considered the same by responding with ’equivalent’ or ’not equivalent’.

Zero shot

As an instrument for question comparison evaluation, consider the questions and determine if their meaning is the same, responding with ’equivalent’ for similar questions or ’not equivalent’ for different questions.

Role oriented

Review the sentence below and identify whether its grammar is ’Acceptable’ or ’Unacceptable’: Here are three examples. Sentence: Our friends won’t buy this analysis, let alone the next one we propose. Answer: acceptable. Sentence: One more pseudo generalization and I’m giving up. Answer: acceptable. Sentence: They drank the pub. Answer: unacceptable.

Task oriented

Few shot

Functioning as a grammar evaluation tool, analyze the given sentence and decide if it is grammatically correct, responding with ’acceptable’ or ’unacceptable’: Here are three examples. Sentence: Our friends won’t buy this analysis, let alone the next one we propose. Answer: acceptable. Sentence: One more pseudo generalization and I’m giving up. Answer: acceptable. Sentence: They drank the pub. Answer: unacceptable.

Role oriented

Zero-Shot Chain-of-Thought is appending the phrase “Let’s think step by step” to the end of a question.

- • EmotionPrompt (Li et al., 2023a): Drawing inspiration from psychology and social science theories about human emotional intelligence, this method adds emotional stimuli to origin prompts. For example: “This is very important to my career.”
- • Expert Prompting (Xu et al., 2023): The key idea is to let model be an expert in role playing. To generate the expert identity, we first provide several instruction-expert pair exemplars, then the model generates an expert identity of this question. Finally, we ask the model to answer the instruction conditioned on expert identity.
- • Generated Knowledge (Liu et al., 2022): Generated Knowledge Prompting is a method where a model first generates knowledge and then uses this generated information as additional input to answer questions. It enhances commonsense reasoning in AI without requiring task-specific knowledge integration or a structured knowledge base.
- • Least to Most (Zhou et al., 2023a): Least to Most breaks down a complex problem into a series of simpler subproblems and then solves them in sequence. The key idea is to solve each subproblem by using the answers to previously solved subproblems. This method is particularly useful for tasks that require solving problems harder than the exemplars shown in the prompts.

Note that there are plenty of prompt engineering techniques and we tried our best to include those general techniques instead of specific prompt engineering techniques such as Tree of Thoughts (Yao et al., 2023) that requires specific prompt design and decomposition of each problem.

- B.4.3 Adversarial Prompt Attacks

Adversarial prompt attacks, as proposed by Zhu et al. (2023b), aims to simulate potential disturbances that could naturally arise in practical scenarios. The proposed prompt attacks

are intended to resemble common user errors or expressions, as users often make various mistakes when inputting prompts, such as typos, diverse word choices, and different sentence constructions. The prompt attacks encompass four distinct levels:

- • Character-level: Techniques such as TextBugger (Li et al., 2019) and DeepWordBug (Gao et al., 2018) are employed. These methods introduce errors or typos into words by altering characters.
- • Word-level: Attacks like BertAttack (Li et al., 2020) and TextFooler (Jin et al., 2019) are utilized. They focus on substituting words with their synonyms or contextually similar alternatives.
- • Sentence-level: StressTest (Naik et al., 2018) and CheckList (Ribeiro et al., 2020) are applied. These attacks add irrelevant or redundant sentences to prompts.
- • Semantic-level: To simulate the linguistic styles of different global regions.

- B.5 Pipeline The full pipeline of using PromptBench for evaluation is shown in Figure 2.

Figure 5 illustrates the outcomes of dynamic evaluations across various models and tasks. GPT-4 outperforms its counterparts significantly, yet there remains potential for enhancement in the performance of linear equation, abductive logic, and max sum path task.

### Appendix D. Extensibility

Each module in PromptBench can be easily extended. In the following, we provide basic guidelines for customizing your own datasets, models, prompt engineering methods, and evaluation metrics. The sample code for adding new datasets, models can be found in https://github.com/microsoft/promptbench/blob/main/examples/add_new_modules. md

- D.1 Add new datasets Adding new datasets involves two steps:

- 1. Implementing a New Dataset Class: Datasets are supposed to be implemented in dataload/dataset.py and inherit from the Dataset class. For your custom dataset, implement the init method to load your dataset. We recommend organizing your data samples as dictionaries to facilitate the input process.

- 2. Adding an Interface: After customizing the dataset class, register it in the DataLoader class within dataload.py.

- D.2 Add new models Similar to adding new datasets, the addition of new models also consists of two steps.

- 1. Implementing a New Model Class: Models should be implemented in models/model.py, inheriting from the LLMModel class. In your customized model, you should implement self.tokenizer and self.model. You may also customize your own predict function for inference. If the predict function is not customized, the default predict function inherited from LLMModel will be used.
- 2. Adding an Interface: After customizing the model class, register it in the create model function within the class LLMModel and MODEL LIST dictionary in init .py.

- D.3 Add new prompt engineering methods Adding new methods in prompt engineering is similar to steps of C.1 and C.2.

- 1. Implementing a New Methods Class: Methods should be implemented in prompt engineering Module. Firstly, create a new .py file for your methods. Then

- implement two functions: init and query. For unified management, two points need be noticed: 1. all methods should inherits from Base class that has common code for prompt engineering methods. 2. prompts used in methods should be stored in prompts/method oriented.py.
- 2. Adding an Interface: After implementing a new methods, register it in the METHOD MAP that is used to map method names to their corresponding class.

#### D.4 Add new metrics and input/output process functions

New evaluation metrics should be implemented as static functions in class Eval within the metrics module. Similarly, new input/output process functions should be implemented as static functions in class InputProcess and class OutputProcess in the utils module.
