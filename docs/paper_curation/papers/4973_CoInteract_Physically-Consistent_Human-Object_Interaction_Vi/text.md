Abstract. Synthesizing human–object interaction (HOI) videos has broad

practical value in e-commerce, digital advertising, and virtual marketing. However, current diffusion models, despite their photorealistic rendering capability, still frequently fail on (i) the structural stability of sensitive regions such as hands and faces and (ii) physically plausible contact (e.g., avoiding hand–object interpenetration). We present CoInteract, an end-to-end framework for HOI video synthesis conditioned on a person reference image, a product reference image, text prompts, and speech audio. CoInteract introduces two complementary designs embedded into a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) backbone. First, we propose a Human-Aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) that routes tokens to lightweight, region-specialized experts via spatially supervised routing, improving fine-grained structural fidelity with minimal parameter overhead. Second, we propose Spatially-Structured Co-Generation, a dual-stream training paradigm that jointly models an RGB appearance stream and an auxiliary HOI structure stream to inject interaction geometry priors. During training, the HOI stream attends to RGB tokens and its supervision regularizes shared backbone weights; at inference, the HOI branch is removed for zero-overhead RGB generation. Experimental results demonstrate that CoInteract significantly outperforms existing methods in structural stability, logical consistency, and interaction realism.

### 1 Introduction

Driven by the remarkable progress in video generation [20, 42], speech-driven avatar generation [50,52,57,59] has achieved unprecedented photorealism, which has opened up vast possibilities for digital humans in e-commerce [22,23,38], virtual assistance [11,31], and remote education [46,47]. However, as demand shifts

No structured interaction constrain

Heavy inference-time preprocessing

Easy to use HOI structure aware

- Fig. 1: Given two reference images, a text prompt, and audio, CoInteract generates high-fidelity HOI videos. Bottom: Comparison of generation paradigms. Unlike existing methods that rely on heavy inference-time preprocessing and lack structured interaction constraints, CoInteract implements a unified, end-to-end generation framework that is both easy to use and inherently aware of HOI structures.

from passive speaking to active product demonstration, Human-Object Interaction (HOI) video synthesis has emerged as the next critical frontier, requiring coordinated hand movements, precise object manipulation, and strict physical plausibility beyond what existing talking-avatar generation methods provide.

As shown in Fig. 1, prior work on HOI video synthesis can be broadly grouped into two paradigms. (i) Multi-condition generation. These methods extract per-frame human poses and object conditions to guide generation [26, 43, 51], but the required preprocessing and domain-specific signals often limit robustness and generalization. (ii) Multi-reference generation. Another line conditions a generative model on person/product references, either by directly synthesizing videos from multiple references [5, 17, 21] or by compositing references via image editing and then performing speech-to-video generation [10,48,54]. While more flexible, these approaches typically lack explicit mechanisms to enforce interaction structure—e.g. interaction geometry and physically plausible hand poses—often leading to implausible human–object interaction.

We argue that this limitation is rooted in the RGB-centric nature of current diffusion backbones. As also observed in recent studies [49,53], models trained purely on pixel-level supervision have no built-in notion of 3D hand-object spatial relationships or body structure, and must rely on appearance cues alone to infer interaction, which leads to two recurring failure modes: (1) structural collapse in hands and faces, where fingers merge or facial features blur, and (2) physical violations such as human-object interpenetration, where hands pass through product surfaces due to the lack of explicit object boundary awareness.

To address these challenges, we argue that a model must not only "see" pixels but also "understand" the underlying structural and interaction relationships. In this paper, we present CoInteract, an end-to-end framework that introduces a Spatially-Structured Co-Generation paradigm for physically-consistent HOI video synthesis. Our core philosophy is to embed human structural priors and HOI physical constraints directly into the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) backbone, transforming it from a pure appearance generator into a structureaware interaction engine. The technical contribution of CoInteract is twofold. First, we propose a Human-Aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) to improve hand and face quality. Using face and hand bounding boxes as supervision, a lightweight router learns to dispatch tokens to region-specialized experts that enhance structural fidelity with only a marginal increase in parameters. Second, we introduce a dual-stream co-generation paradigm to enforce physical plausibility. An auxiliary HOI structure stream—where the human body is reduced to a silhouette while the object retains its RGB appearance—is jointly trained with the RGB stream within a shared DiT backbone. This forces the backbone to learn spatial and interaction relationships rather than relying on appearance cues alone. During training, the HOI stream attends to RGB tokens and its supervision regularizes the shared backbone; at inference, we keep only the RGB stream. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CoInteract consistently outperforms existing methods in interaction plausibility, structural stability, and identity preservation. Our contributions are summarized as follows:

- – We propose CoInteract, a novel end-to-end framework for speech-driven HOI video synthesis that embeds human structural priors and interaction geometry constraints directly into the DiT backbone, ensuring both physical plausibility and structural consistency without relying on external preprocessing or post-processing.
- – We introduce a Human-Aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) that uses spatial supervision to guide lightweight specialized experts for hands and faces. This targeted processing ensures high structural fidelity and effectively reduces the artifacts commonly seen in these critical regions, with minimal additional parameters.
- – We develop a Spatially-Structured Co-Generation paradigm using an asymmetric co-attention mask to embed physical interaction rules into the DiT. This approach forces the model to respect geometric constraints and substantially reduces hand-object interpenetration, while ensuring zero additional computational cost at inference.

#### 2.1 Video Diffusion Models

Video diffusion models [1,13,20,21,42] have evolved rapidly from image diffusion to temporally coherent video synthesis. Early methods [1,13] extend image priors with temporal modules but often suffer from flickering and drift. Subsequent works [40,41] improve consistency via patch- or view-based designs. Recent stateof-the-art approaches [21,42] predominantly adopt DiT-style backbones [33] to model spatiotemporal tokens with global attention.

Despite strong visual quality, RGB-centric video diffusion models remain fragile in complex human–object interaction (HOI) scenarios [27], where supervision provides weak constraints on contact geometry and body topology. This often manifests as hand/face distortions and contact violations such as interpenetration. To introduce additional structural cues, recent works explore multistream co-generation by jointly predicting auxiliary modalities (e.g., depth or flow) alongside RGB [4,14], or by explicitly injecting geometric constraints during training [49]. However, these methods target general video synthesis and do not explicitly address HOI-specific challenges such as stable hand articulation under occlusion and physically plausible grasping. Our work focuses on HOI and injects interaction-structure supervision and region-specific specialization into a shared DiT backbone.

#### 2.2 Audio-driven Human Animation

Audio-driven human animation has achieved impressive results for talking heads and avatars, emphasizing lip synchronization and identity preservation [31,34, 45, 50, 57, 59, 62]. Beyond faces, co-speech gesture generation maps speech to plausible body/hand motion, where diffusion models are effective in capturing one-to-many motion variability [9, 10, 12, 24, 54]. However, most prior work focuses on human-only motion and does not explicitly enforce hand–object contact constraints in rendered videos.

Recent studies recognize that hands and faces require dedicated treatment. CyberHost [25] introduces region attention with learnable latent features to refine hand/face synthesis, and Make-Your-Anchor [16] applies post-hoc face enhancement. These approaches typically act as external add-ons that are decoupled from the generative backbone. In contrast, we embed a Human-Aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) directly into DiT blocks to specialize capacity for hands/faces within the generation process, and further introduce HOI-structured supervision to improve physically plausible interactions.

#### 2.3 Human–Object Interaction Video Generation

HOI video synthesis requires jointly modeling human motion, object manipulation, and physically plausible contact. Existing approaches can be roughly grouped into two paradigms.

- (i) Multi-condition generation. These methods augment diffusion models

with explicit pose and object-related structural controls [26,43,51]. For instance, AnchorCrafter [51] conditions on human pose and multi-view object features, while ByteLoom [26] introduces geometric priors (e.g., relative coordinate maps) to improve spatial alignment. While effective, such approaches rely on heavy preprocessing and external signals, and often do not internalize HOI constraints within the backbone.

- (ii) Multi-reference generation. Another line injects identity and prod-

uct references without explicit geometry conditions. This includes direct multireference video synthesis [5,17,21,61] and two-stage pipelines that composite references via image editing [2,48] before speech-to-video generation [9,10,44,54]. Despite flexibility, these methods often lack HOI-specific structural supervision, leading to unstable hand articulation and implausible contact.

CoInteract addresses these limitations by formulating HOI synthesis as spatially-

structured co-generation: it jointly trains an RGB stream with an auxiliary HOI structure stream to inject interaction geometry priors, and uses a Human-Aware MoE to stabilize structurally sensitive regions, while enabling zero-overhead inference by removing the auxiliary HOI branch.

### 3 Method

As illustrated in Fig. 2, we present CoInteract, an end-to-end framework for speech-driven human–object interaction (HOI) video synthesis. Given dual reference images (character identity Iref and product Iprod) together with motion frames Vmot that preserve temporal continuity [10,30,58], our goal is to synthesize HOI videos that are both structurally stable and physically plausible. Unlike conventional video diffusion models that operate purely in RGB space, CoInteract explicitly injects interaction structure and body-level consistency into a shared Diffusion Transformer (DiT) backbone.

#### 3.1 Unified RGB–HOI Co-Generation

Standard diffusion-based video models learn RGB-dominated spatiotemporal priors without explicit supervision on interaction geometry. While effective for general synthesis, they provide weak constraints for contact topology and occlusion ordering, often producing HOI artifacts such as hand–object interpenetration and unstable hand articulation.

To address this, we introduce a unified co-generation paradigm (Fig. 2(a)) in which an RGB appearance stream zr and an auxiliary HOI structure stream zh are jointly trained within a single DiT backbone. The key insight is to train with a texture-stripped HOI structure stream that preserves interaction geometry (mesh projection with fused object masks) while removing appearance cues, thereby guiding shared weights toward physically consistent representations.

- Fig. 2: Overview of CoInteract. (a) The framework jointly generates RGB and HOI streams within a shared DiT backbone equipped with a Human-Aware MoE. An asymmetric co-attention mask enforces interaction-structure supervision during training;

the HOI branch is removed at inference. Vr,h and Pr,h denote the hidden states and prompts of the RGB and HOI streams, respectively. (b) 3D RoPE assigns distinct spatiotemporal coordinates to motion, RGB, reference, and HOI latents. (c) The HumanAware MoE employs a spatially supervised router to dispatch head and hand tokens to specialized experts.

HOI structure stream. We construct an auxiliary HOI structure stream as a silhouette-like 3-channel rendering obtained by projecting the recovered human mesh to the image plane and fusing the projected object mask. This produces a pixel-aligned structural target that highlights interaction boundaries while discarding RGB texture.

Tokenization and shared backbone. The two streams are tokenized by modalityspecific patch embedding layers (with the same patch size) and then fed into shared DiT blocks. The HOI stream uses a fixed descriptive prompt template to provide consistent semantic conditioning. Within each DiT block, the two streams share all transformer parameters but employ stream-specific modulation parameters (scale and shift in adaptive layer normalization), enabling a single backbone to specialize feature statistics for appearance versus structure without duplicating the full model.

Joint flow-matching objective. We optimize the model with a joint flow-matching objective supervising both streams:

Lflow = Lr + λhLh. (1)

0,z1 ∥vr − vθ(zr,t,t,c)∥22 , Lh = Et,z

Lr = Et,z

0,z1 ∥vh − vθ(zh,t,t,c)∥22 .

(2)

where v denotes the target velocity field, t is the diffusion timestep, and c denotes conditioning (text, audio, dual reference images, and motion latents). We set λh = 1 unless otherwise stated.

Multi-Modal Coordinate Assignment via 3D RoPE To seamlessly integrate heterogeneous modalities—ranging from historical motion and static references to dual-stream generative latents—we assign each token a 3D coordinate (h,w,t) encoded by 3D Rotary Positional Encoding (3D RoPE). As illustrated in Fig. 2(b), our coordinate assignment enforces the following inductive biases:

- – Spatial coordinates for dual streams. To preserve pixel-level correspondence between RGB and HOI, we concatenate the two streams along the width dimension, assigning distinct horizontal coordinates—e.g. w ∈ [0,W] for RGB and w ∈ [−W,0] for HOI—while sharing identical height and time indices. This allows the model to learn cross-stream alignment through relative positional distances.
- – Temporal causality and reference anchoring. We explicitly structure the temporal axis to distinguish between motion context, generated video, and identity reference:

- 1. Historical motion (t < 0). Past motion frames are assigned negative temporal indices (e.g., t ∈ {−N,...,−1}), placing them logically before the current generation window to encourage causal motion continuity.
- 2. Reference anchoring (t ≫ T). Static reference images are mapped to a far-field temporal location (e.g., t = 30,31) with a significant offset, encouraging the model to treat them as global identity anchors rather than adjacent frames.

Formally, the position of any token x is encoded as:

Pos(xi,j,k) = RoPE3D(hi,wj′,tk), (3)

where wj′ accounts for the virtual width shift in the HOI stream. This unified mapping encourages the attention mechanism to respect structural and temporal relationships across all inputs.

𝐿 𝐿 𝐿 𝐿

- Fig. 3: Two-stage training and inference (DiT blocks omitted for clarity). Stage 1 uses full attention to establish coupling between the RGB and HOI streams. Stage 2 applies an asymmetric co-attention mask, enabling removal of the HOI branch at inference for

efficiency. Lr and Lh denote the flow-matching losses for the RGB and HOI streams, respectively, and red dashed arrows indicate gradient flow into shared DiT parameters.

Two-Stage Asymmetric Co-Attention To inject interaction-structure supervision while maintaining inference efficiency, we adopt a two-stage training strategy with an Asymmetric Co-Attention mechanism (Fig. 3). In Stage 1, standard bidirectional attention is applied across both streams for rapid convergence, allowing the model to learn global dependencies between appearance and interaction structure. In Stage 2, we enforce an asymmetric attention mask. Let Tr and Th denote the token sets for the RGB and HOI streams, respectively, and let rows correspond to queries and columns to keys. The mask M is defined as:

 

1, if i ∈ Tr, j ∈ Tr, 1, if i ∈ Th, j ∈ Tr ∪ Th, 0, otherwise.

(4)

Mi,j =



Under this mask, RGB queries attend only to RGB tokens, making the RGB pathway independent of the HOI branch and thus removable at inference with zero overhead. HOI queries, conversely, attend to both streams, leveraging cleaner RGB features to predict interaction structure. Crucially, Lh backpropagates through the HOI←RGB cross-attention into the shared DiT parameters; since the RGB stream reuses the same parameters at inference, this transfers interactionstructure supervision to the RGB generator even when the HOI branch is removed.

#### 3.2 Human-Aware Mixture-of-Experts

While structured co-generation injects interaction priors into the backbone, hands and faces may still exhibit artifacts due to their high-frequency detail and articulation complexity. We therefore incorporate a Human-Aware Mixtureof-Experts (MoE) module [8,37] that routes tokens to region-specialized experts via a spatially supervised router R (Fig. 2(c)). We include a Shared expert that reuses the original DiT FFN as a shortcut path, and three lightweight experts (Head, Hand, Base) implemented as small FFNs, introducing a modest parameter overhead. This enables dedicated capacity for anatomically sensitive

regions, improving hand sharpness and face identity consistency without degrading general synthesis quality.

Spatially supervised routing. To prevent router optimization from interfering with the DiT representation learning, we apply a stop-gradient operation sg[·] to hidden states before routing. The routing probability for token xi is computed as:

G(xi) = Softmax(Wg · sg[hi]). (5) Using face and hand bounding boxes, the router assigns tokens inside the corresponding regions to Ehead or Ehand, while remaining tokens are processed by the base expert. We enforce specialization via a cross-entropy routing loss:

⊮(yi = k)log(G(xi)k), (6)

Lroute = −

i k∈{head,hand,base}

where yi is the ground-truth region label and ⊮(·) is the indicator function. The total training objective is:

Ltotal = Lflow + ηLroute. (7)

#### 3.3 Data Curation and Representation

To facilitate structure-aware training, we transform raw HOI videos into paired RGB and HOI-structure representations (Fig. 4). We first decouple entities using Qwen-Edit [48] to create independent person and product references, followed by a validation module that filters mismatched (source image, person, object) triplets. For geometric supervision, we use SAM3 [3] to obtain object masks and SAM3D-body [55] to recover a human mesh, which is then projected to the image plane. We fuse the projected human rendering with the object mask to form a texture-stripped HOI structure stream Vh. Since this HOI stream is geometryfocused, the model is encouraged to learn spatial and interaction relationships rather than exploiting appearance shortcuts. Finally, both RGB video Vr and HOI stream Vh are encoded into a shared latent space via a pre-trained VAE for dual-stream training. Additionally, we use off-the-shelf detectors [29,36] to obtain face and hand bounding boxes, which provide explicit supervision for the MoE router during training.

### 4 Experiments

#### 4.1 Training Details

Dataset. We curate a large-scale HOI video dataset following Section 3.3, comprising 40 hours of product demonstration and live-streaming videos. After quality filtering, 12K high-quality clips are retained with paired RGB–HOI representations, hand/face bounding boxes, and silhouette masks. A held-out test set of 50 clips covers diverse product categories and unseen identities.

Implementation Details. CoInteract is initialized from WanS2V [10]. The Human-Aware MoE consists of four experts: one Shared expert that reuses the original DiT FFN, and three lightweight experts (Head, Hand, Base) each implemented as a light FFN with hidden dimension 256. The router is a two-layer MLP trained with spatial supervision. AdamW [19] is used with learning rate 1×10−4 and cosine annealing. Training proceeds in two stages: full bidirectional self-attention with 5K iterations, followed by asymmetric co-attention with 2K iterations. Loss weights are λh = 1 and η = 1. The HOI branch is discarded at inference, incurring zero additional cost. As for inference settings, we set CFG with 5, inference steps with 40, and generate videos at 480p resolution.

#### 4.2 Quantitative Comparison

Baselines. We compare CoInteract against AnchorCrafter [51], Phantom [28], Humo [5], InteractAvatar [60], SkyReels-V3 [21], and VACE [17]. All methods use identical reference images and audio inputs. Since InteractAvatar does not natively support separate injection of identity and product references, we first use Qwen-Image [48] to composite both references into a single image before feeding it to the model; its results therefore partly benefit from the image editing model’s compositing capability. For AnchorCrafter, we follow the authors’ preprocessing pipeline to prepare per-frame pose and object annotations for all test samples.

Evaluation Metrics. We evaluate from four complementary aspects.

Video Quality. AES↑ measures perceptual aesthetics via the LAION aesthetic predictor [35]. IQ↑ uses MUSIQ [18] for frame-level perceptual quality. Smooth↑ computes CLIP cosine similarity between consecutive frames. All three metrics are computed via VBench [15].

Human–Object Interaction. Standardized benchmarks for evaluating HOI video quality remain scarce; we therefore rely primarily on two automatic metrics alongside a perceptual user study (Sec. 4.4). VLM-QA↑ employs Gemini3-Pro [39], one of the most capable video perception models, to assess HOI plausibility. We design a structured questionnaire of 50 binary (0/1) questions that probe interaction rationality; the per-video score is the fraction of positive responses, averaged over the test set. HQ↑ (Hand Quality) computes the mean confidence of hand keypoints detected by DWPose [56], averaged over all frames in the generated video. Higher scores indicate more structurally plausible and clearly rendered hands.

Reference Consistency. DINOid↑ measures DINOv2 [32] cosine similarity between the identity reference Iref and generated character crops. DINOobj↑ measures DINOv2 similarity between the product reference Iprod and generated object regions. FaceSim↑ computes ArcFace [7] cosine similarity between reference face embeddings and generated face embeddings averaged across frames.

Audio-Visual Alignment. Syncconf↑ is the lip-sync confidence score [6].

Results. Table 1 presents quantitative comparisons. CoInteract achieves the best or competitive results across most metrics. In particular, it obtains the highest VLM-QA (0.72) and HQ (0.724), confirming superior interaction plausibility and hand structural stability. It also leads in identity preservation (DINOid: 0.671, FaceSim: 0.696) and temporal coherence (Smooth: 0.9951). Phantom and Humo score slightly higher on AES, partly because they tend to hallucinate novel backgrounds that happen to look aesthetically pleasing but deviate from the input reference (see Fig. 5); CoInteract instead faithfully preserves the reference scene, which trades marginal aesthetic scores for stronger consistency.

#### 4.3 Qualitative Results

- Fig. 5 presents qualitative comparisons across diverse scenarios. CoInteract consistently produces videos with coherent hand articulation, natural product grasping, and faithful prompt adherence. Other baselines exhibit varying degrees of deficiency in HOI plausibility, prompt compliance, and background consistencycommon failure modes include hand-object interpenetration, inconsistent product appearance, and background deviation from the reference. AnchorCrafter performs noticeably better on the last two cases, which correspond to objects in its training set; on the first two unseen-object cases, it suffers from identity drift and unnatural interaction boundaries, revealing limited generalization. InteractAvatar benefits from Qwen-Image compositing, which provides a strong initial frame with correct object placement; however, as generation progresses, it still produces HOI plausibility issues such as unnatural grasping poses (e.g., last row). In contrast, CoInteract maintains physically plausible interaction and structural stability throughout the full sequence.

Visualization of HOI branch and Human-Aware MoE To further investigate CoInteract’s internal mechanisms, we visualize the dual-stream generation and MoE routing behavior in Fig. 6. The HOI stream maintains precise spatiotemporal synchronization with the RGB stream, providing a consistent geometric scaffold that mitigates hand-object interpenetration even during drastic motions such as opening a bin lid. The routing heatmaps confirm that the router accurately isolates face and hand tokens and dispatches them to specialized experts, maintaining high-frequency structural fidelity even under rapid movement.

#### 4.4 User Study

We conducted a perceptual user study with 24 evaluators recruited via crowdsourcing. Each evaluator was shown 10 randomly sampled test cases. For each case, all methods were provided with identical inputs, and the resulting videos

Evaluators were asked to rank the methods (lower is better) according to three criteria: Object Consistency, Human/Background Consistency, and Interaction Plausibility. Table 2 reports the mean rank. CoInteract achieves the best (lowest) mean rank across all criteria, with the largest advantage on Interaction Plausibility, consistent with our HOI-focused design.

#### 4.5 Ablation Study

We systematically ablate each core component via four model variants: (1) w/o MoE, replacing the Human-Aware MoE with a standard FFN to disable expert specialization; (2) w/o Co-Gen, removing the HOI stream entirely to reduce the model to a single-stream RGB baseline without structural supervision; (3) w/o Asym. Mask, replacing the Stage-2 asymmetric co-attention mask with standard bidirectional self-attention, requiring the HOI branch to be retained at inference; and (4) Full Model, the complete CoInteract. All variants share identical training configurations.

Quantitative results are reported in Table 3. Removing MoE (row 1) notably degrades HQ (0.724 → 0.658) and FaceSim (0.696 → 0.662), confirming its role

in fine-grained structural fidelity. Removing the HOI stream (row 2) causes the largest drop in VLM-QA (0.72 → 0.48, −33.3%), demonstrating that the auxiliary stream is essential for internalizing physical interaction constraints. Retaining the HOI branch at inference (row 3) slightly surpasses the full model on VLM-QA (0.76) and HQ (0.738), as expected from direct structural guidance; however, it inflates inference cost to 4.13× due to the doubled token count. The MoE introduces only a 1.04× overhead relative to the MoE-free baseline, confirming its minimal impact on inference efficiency. Our asymmetric strategy trades marginal interaction gains for a dramatic efficiency improvement at near-zero additional inference cost. Qualitative results in Fig. 7 corroborate these findings: removing co-generation yields physically implausible interactions, while removing MoE leads to hand collapse and blurred facial details.

### 5 Conclusion

This paper presents CoInteract, a structure-aware framework for speech-driven human-object interaction (HOI) video synthesis that prioritizes structural integrity and physical consistency. The framework introduces a Human-Aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) to enhance the fidelity of hands and faces through a spatially-supervised routing policy. Furthermore, the Spatially-Structured CoGeneration paradigm, utilizing an asymmetric co-attention mask, allows the model to learn physical interaction priors during training. This architecture effectively reduces hand-object interpenetration and geometric misalignment while maintaining a zero-overhead inference path. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CoInteract consistently outperforms existing methods in interaction plausibility and structural stability, advancing the quality of HOI video generation.
