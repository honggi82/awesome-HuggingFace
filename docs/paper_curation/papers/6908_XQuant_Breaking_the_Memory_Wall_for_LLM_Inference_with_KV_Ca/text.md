Abstract

Although LLM inference has emerged as a critical workload for many downstream applications, efficiently inferring LLMs is challenging due to the substantial memory footprint and bandwidth requirements. In parallel, compute capabilities have steadily outpaced both memory capacity and bandwidth over the last few decades, a trend that remains evident in modern GPU hardware and exacerbates the challenge of LLM inference. As such, new algorithms are emerging that trade increased computation for reduced memory operations. To that end, we present XQUANT, which takes advantage of this trend, enabling an order-of-magnitude reduction in memory consumption through low-bit quantization with substantial accuracy benefits relative to state-of-the-art KV cache quantization methods. We accomplish this by quantizing and caching the layer input activations X, instead of using standard KV caching, and then rematerializing the Keys and Values on-the-fly during inference. This results in an immediate 2× memory savings compared to KV caching. By applying XQUANT, we achieve up to ∼ 7.7× memory savings with < 0.1 perplexity degradation compared to the FP16 baseline. Furthermore, our approach leverages the fact that X values are similar across layers. Building on this observation, we introduce XQUANT-CL, which exploits the cross-layer similarity in the X embeddings for extreme compression. Across different models, XQUANT-CL attains up to 10× memory savings relative to the FP16 baseline with only 0.01 perplexity degradation, and 12.5× memory savings with only 0.1 perplexity degradation. Notably, despite using standard uniform quantization, XQUANT-CL is able to surpass intricate KV cache quantization methods that employ non-uniform quantization with outlier-aware strategies. Given the aforementioned trends in compute versus memory scaling for future generations of hardware platforms, XQUANT adopts a forward-looking perspective to accelerate LLM inference: XQUANT seeks to exploit the rapidly increasing compute capabilities to eliminate the memory bottleneck, while surpassing state-of-the-art KV cache quantization methods and achieving near-FP16 accuracy across a wide range of models.

### 1 Introduction

Large Language Models (LLMs) have seen widespread adoption as a standard paradigm across a range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications [6, 3, 31, 34]. While LLMs achieve remarkable performance on these tasks, they have substantial inference costs due to their large parameter count as well as the number of memory operations required when running generation. Prior work has demonstrated how LLM inference tends to be Memory BandwidthBound, rather than Compute-Bound [20, 33, 27], and therefore reducing the memory footprint of LLMs is critical to enable downstream applications. For short context lengths and small batch sizes, the model weights are typically the memory bottleneck. However, for long context lengths and large batch sizes, the main memory bottleneck for LLM inference is the Key-Value (KV) cache, which is the embedded representation of the entire sequence used in the self-attention mechanism and which grows linearly with respect to the sequence length [33, 27]. During inference, generating each new token requires repeatedly loading and storing the entire KV cache, which becomes prohibitively expensive and leads to substantial slowdown. This motivates efforts to reduce KV cache memory operations to speed up the inference process. One promising solution to compress the KV cache is through KV cache quantization [15, 23].

The top right edge of the plot represents the optimal configuration that attains the most memory compression and the least perplexity degradation. Memory compression factor and perplexity degradation are with respect to the FP16 baseline. As shown in Table 4, XQUANT-CL achieves only 0.01 perplexity degradation while getting 10× memory savings with 3-bit quantization, and 0.1 perplexity degradation while getting 12.5× memory compression with 2-bit quantization.

Quantizing the KV cache reduces the memory footprint and number of memory operations required during decoding by using fewer bits to represent the Keys and Values. However, while existing methods retain accuracy even when quantizing the KV cache to low precision (e.g., 4-bit quantization), further reducing the bit-width of KV activations often degrades model performance.

In this work, we present XQUANT, a method which quantizes the input activations X of each layer, rather than the KV cache, to reduce the required memory consumption. Our method is visualized in Figure 2. Quantizing X provides a 2× memory savings compared with quantizing the KV cache, since we only need to store one tensor per layer instead of separate Keys and Values. Interestingly, we also find that X is more amenable to extremely low-bit quantization than the KV cache. Moreover, although rematerializing KV cache from X requires additional computation during decoding, we can afford this cost because LLM inference is progressively becoming more memory-bandwidth bound. This phenomenon will be increasingly prevalent with future hardware platforms, as the rate of improvement in compute capabilities continue to outpace increases in memory bandwidth and capacity [11]. In this work, we make the following contributions (which are summarized in Figure 1):

- • To reduce the memory consumption for LLM inference, XQUANT quantizes the input X activations, providing a 2× memory savings relative to quantizing the KV cache directly, and then rematerializes the KV activations on-the-fly during inference (see Section 3.1). We show that for the same memory footprint (∼ 7.7× savings compared to FP16), XQUANT attains up to ∼ 0.9 less perplexity degradation compared to KV cache quantization and < 0.1 perplexity degradation compared to the FP16 baseline (see Section 4.1).
- • For ultra-low precision quantization with accuracy comparable to the FP16 baseline, we present XQUANT-CL, a method that exploits the cross-layer similarity in the X embeddings. Our approach compresses the differences in X between successive layers, which have much smaller range as a result of the residual stream in the

- Figure 2: A visualization of how XQUANT reduces the memory footprint by caching the input embedding (X) instead of the KV cache. We use the cached input to rematerialize the Keys and Values in order to compute attention. This increases the amount of computation required when computing attention. However, since LLM inference is typically memory bandwidth-bound, we can accelerate inference by reducing memory operations, even at the expense of additional compute operations.

Transformer[36] architecture (see Section 3.2). Using standard asymmetric uniform quantization, we observe only 0.01 perplexity degradation with 3-bit quantization while attaining 10× memory savings compared to the FP16 baseline, and only 0.1 perplexity degradation with 2-bit quantization and 12.5× memory savings relative to FP16 (see Section 4.3). Remarkably, XQUANT-CL outperforms state-of-the-art KV cache quantization methods like KVQuant [15] that use complex techniques such as non-uniform quantization and outlier-aware dense-and-sparse strategies. On the Wikitext-2 and C4 datasets, we reduce perplexity degradation by ∼ 0.4 compared to KVQuant while using 1.9× less memory (see Section 4.3).

- • We extend XQUANT and XQUANT-CL to support new models that use Grouped Query Attention (GQA) [1]. For GQA models, we decompose the Key and Value projection weight matrices offline using the singular value decomposition (SVD), and we then down-project the input activations into a smaller latent space, reducing memory consumption. Interestingly, we observe that the X distribution in this latent space is suitable for extremely low precision quantization (see Section 3.3). For 2-bit quantization, XQUANT achieves less than 2.2 perplexity degradation relative to KV cache quantization (see Section 4.1). XQUANT-CL further improves performance by resulting in only ∼ 0.1 perplexity degradation compared to the FP16 baseline while saving 6.7× memory (see Section 4.3).
- • Finally, we provide a system-level analysis of computational overheads and memory savings from rematerialization. We show that XQUANT is able to significantly reduce memory consumption while preserving accuracy, which will ultimately result in speedup even at the cost of additional computation, as compute continues to dominate memory capacity and bandwidth (see Section 3.4).

##### 2.1 Memory Wall for LLM Inference

When assessing the performance of kernels on a target hardware platform, their runtime is determined by either 1) the amount of compute operations that need to be performed or 2) the amount of memory operations that need to be performed. Which of these two factors is the bottleneck depends on the characteristics of the target hardware as well as those of the kernel. Arithmetic Intensity, which is defined as the ratio of the number of compute operations that need to be performed per byte transferred to or from memory, is a typical metric to evaluate a kernel and is usually expressed in units of floating point operations (FLOPs) per byte:

Compute Operations Performed Bytes Transfered

, (1)

Arithmetic Intensity =

We can characterize the target hardware platform in terms of the ratio of the peak compute performance of the device versus the amount of memory bandwidth that it provides. The ratio of peak compute to memory bandwidth, typically also expressed as FLOPs per byte similar to arithmetic intensity, is referred to here as the ridge point for that hardware platform (we use this term as it aligns with the point on a Roofline plot [37] which delineates compute-bound versus memory-bandwidth bound kernels for a target hardware platform):

Peak Compute Throughput Peak Memory Bandwidth

. (2)

Ridge Point =

When assessing whether a provided kernel is memory bandwidth-bound or compute-bound, we need only compare the arithmetic intensity of the kernel with the ridge point of our target hardware platform. If the arithmetic intensity is larger, then the kernel is compute-bound when run on the target hardware; if the arithmetic intensity is smaller, then the kernel will be memory-bandwidth bound [33, 37, 45].

When considering LLM inference, a key challenge is that it has low arithmetic intensity for most batch sizes and context length regimes [19, 20, 33]. This is because generating each token only requires performing low intensity matrix-vector multiplications, whereas loading these matrices requires far more memory operations. Thus, LLM inference performs very few floating point operations per byte loaded from memory. Additionally, when we assess scaling trends with LLMs and hardware compute and memory, there is a growing discrepancy between the memory capabilities of existing devices and an LLM’s demands. This phenomenon has been termed the Memory Wall problem [11]. There are two key components to this problem:

- 1. The scaling trends in terms of memory requirements for modern LLMs have dramatically outpaced both the increases in memory capacity and bandwidth on hardware.
- 2. The scaling in peak computational performance is orders of magnitude greater than the corresponding increases in memory capacity and bandwidth on hardware.

Taking these factors together, it is critical to reduce the number of memory operations required for LLM inference. If we can additionally reduce the memory requirements by increasing the amount of computation, this will be beneficial, due to the growing gap between peak computational performance and memory capabilities of hardware platforms.

Motivation

While increasing computation in exchange for reduced memory usage may introduce latency on today’s hardware, this tradeoff is expected to become increasingly favorable. Our work leverages this trend, aiming to reduce memory bottlenecks by utilizing additional compute, ultimately enabling faster LLM inference on future hardware generations.

##### 2.2 Activation Rematerialization

Prior work has explored rematerializing activations, where activations are recomputed on-the-fly from a smaller checkpointed state, as a partial solution to the memory wall problem [16]. Checkmate [16] allowed training large DNNs in memory-constrained GPUs by retaining a subset of intermediate activations as checkpoints, with other activations

being discarded and then rematerialized from these checkpointed states. Checkmate solves for the optimal recomputation setup for the target hardware platform with provided memory constraints. Recent work has also explored rematerializing the KV cache from the input embedding X in the context of serving systems which offload some of the KV entries to the CPU. HCache [10] offloads X to CPU memory, and performs restoration by moving X from CPU to GPU and then recomputing to recover the Keys and Values. [21] also performs rematerialization to recover the Keys and Values from X, and determines the optimal amount of rematerialization to perform, given a combination of compute and memory constraints. While these works focus on system-level optimizations to determine the amount of rematerialization that can be performed, our work focuses on compressing X rather than KV cache activations to attain improved savings relative to existing KV cache compression methods, and then exploits cross-layer similarity in X to attain greater memory savings.

There has also been prior work on trying to avoid storing Keys and Values separately for the KV cache. ElAttention [42] merged the Key and Value projection matrices into other matrices in the model, thereby allowing for computing attention directly using the input embedding. However, this method is not compatible with the rotary positional embedding (RoPE) encodings or with models that use Grouped Query Attention. Slim-Attention [12] similarly aimed to only cache Keys and to multiply them by the inverse Key projection matrix to recover the values (and to merge this inverse matrix into other matrices in the model offline). This approach also requires applying RoPE on-the-fly during inference and is not compatible with models that use grouped-query attention. Moreover, such inverses are not guaranteed to be numerically stable.

##### 2.3 KV Cache Quantization

KV cache quantization has emerged as a promising method for reducing the memory requirements for the KV cache by using fewer bits to represent each floating point element in each KV cache entry. Previous work has quantized the Key distributions per-channel and the Value distributions per-token in order to adapt to the outlier channels in Keys [15, 23]. A crucial aspect of Key cache quantization is handling RoPE [30]. Prior methods have either applied pre-RoPE Key quantization [15] or quantized the Key cache using polar-form representations [38, 13], in order to retain accuracy. Mixed-precision KV cache quantization has been used in order to preserve model accuracy by retaining particularly sensitive tokens in higher precision [44, 14]. Prior work has also explored retaining initial pivot tokens intact [22]; this builds on prior work that identified initial tokens as “attention sink,” tokens which are disproportionately important for preserving model accuracy [39].

##### 2.4 Low-Rank Decomposition for KV Cache and KV Rematerialization

There has also been prior work which has applied a low-rank decomposition to the KV cache or the corresponding projection matrices, in order to cache KV entries with a reduced latent dimension before rematerializing the original KV entries. xKV [4] exploits the fact that the singular vectors for the KV cache entries for successive layers are well aligned to group the KV cache entries across layers and apply SVD to the concatenated KV caches. Loki [29] finds that the keys are low-rank and performs attention in a lower dimension to identify the most important keys, and then only loads those keys for full-dimensional sparse attention. While Loki only reduces memory operations, Eigen Attention [28] actually compresses the KV cache and only does attention in low-rank space. There have also been multiple works which have applied low-rank decomposition to the weights in order to project the KV cache to a lower dimension [47, 5, 41]. LoRC [47] applies SVD to the weight matrices and keeps more singular values at earlier layers to minimize error amplification. Palu [5] performs a low-rank decomposition on the weights offline ahead of inference, and then caches the intermediate KV cache entries. ReCalKV [41] reorders heads before applying SVD to groups of heads in order to retain accuracy and reduce rematerialization overhead. In contrast with these works that aim to compress the KV cache using a low-rank decomposition, XQUANT aims to quantize the X embeddings in order to get a 2× memory savings without applying a low-rank decomposition. XQUANT-CL also exploits the cross-layer similarity in the X distributions by compressing the differences across layers, which provides substantial memory reduction for the same accuracy relative to compressing the KV cache directly.

In this section, we introduce our algorithms XQUANT (Section 3.1) and XQUANT-CL (Section 3.2), and we discuss them in the context of Multi-Head Attention (MHA) models [36]. Then in Section 3.3, we discuss how we extend our

We exploit this similarity using cross-layer compression in XQUANT-CL.

algorithm to support Grouped Query Attention (GQA) models [1]. Note that we specifically address GQA because of its widespread popularity and adoption as an optimization technique for KV cache reduction among many model families such as Llama, Mistral, Gemma, Qwen, etc. [8, 18, 32, 43]. Lastly, in Section 3.4, we discuss the tradeoffs between compute and memory operations that our methods make.

##### 3.1 XQUANT: Quantizing X Instead of KV

The core idea of XQUANT is to reduce the memory requirements of KV caching by checkpointing the input activations and regenerating the Keys and Values from these smaller checkpoints when they need to be used to compute attention. This is shown in Figure 2, where we quantize and cache the input embedding X, which requires 2× less memory than using standard KV caching. The drawback with caching X is that it requires rematerializing the KV cache on-the-fly; this requires multiplying the input embedding by projection matrices Wk and Wv. However, as outlined in Sections

- 2.1 and 3.4, since the arithmetic intensity is typically low for attention in LLM decoding, we can afford to perform additional computation for rematerialization in order to reduce the number of memory operations required. Note that whenever we refer to X, we mean the input activations after layer normalization has been applied to them [36, 46, 40].
- 3.2 XQUANT-CL: Leveraging Cross-Layer Similarity in X

As shown in Figure 3, the X embeddings across successive layers are remarkably similar (when compared with the similarities of KV cache embeddings across layers). This observed property can be attributed to the residual stream which flows from each layer’s input to the outputs of the attention and multi-layer perceptron blocks within that layer, where these outputs are added to the residual stream [36]. In this way, each layer’s function can be understood as simply refining its input, and since this refinement occurs gradually, it is intuitive that the inputs of successive layers are not substantially dissimilar [17]. This represents a promising opportunity for further compression if we can exploit cross-layer similarity.

- Figure 4: Illustration of XQUANT-CL algorithm during decoding. Besides Layer 0, the input to all other layers is a cross layer approximation, computed using the deltas of all previous layers and the input of Layer 0. The input of Layer 0 is summed with each layer’s delta so it can be treated as an accumulator, allowing us to avoid loading all N −1 deltas to compute Layer N’s X. After a layer is done processing, the input embedding to the layer for the last token is subtracted from the output activations of the layer (the same shape as a single token), and this delta is quantized and appended to the ∆Xˆ cache. XQUANT-CL during prefill is visualized in Figure A.1 in Appendix A, which shows how the full ∆Xˆ is computed and cached for each layer.

To exploit the cross-layer similarity in X, we propose XQUANT-CL, which compresses the differences between X for successive layers. Our algorithm during prefill is illustrated in Figure A.1 in Appendix A, and our algorithm for decoding is visualized in Figure 4. Instead of directly quantizing X for layer i, we instead quantize ∆Xi = Xi − Xi−1, which has a much smaller range and hence is much easier to quantize. For this method, we leave the first layer X0 in higher precision, and then compute the differences relative to X0. However, if we directly compute Xi − X0 for a layer i which is far from layer 0, Xi would have accumulated enough changes such that it has diverged substantially from X0, meaning that this delta is no longer easy to quantize. To address this, we quantize and cache ∆Xˆi = Q(Xi − Xˆi−1), where Q is the quantization function and Xˆi−1 is the cross-layer approximation for the previous layer’s X. We then approximate Xi as Xˆi = X0 + ∑ij=1 ∆Xˆ j. This sequential delta summation allows for the explicit accumulation of the refinements that each layer applies to its input, allowing us to exploit the easy quantization properties of these individual deltas for extreme compression. However with the above formulation, computing Xˆ for layer i requires loading all i − 1 previous deltas, which is very expensive. Thus, we maintain an accumulator which sums the deltas of all previous layers (as highlighted in Figure 4). This way, computing Xˆi only requires loading the accumulator (Xˆi−1 = X0 + ∑ij−=11 ∆Xˆ j) and a single delta ∆Xˆi.

##### 3.3 Support for Grouped-Query Attention Models

One challenge with extending XQUANT to many newer LLMs is that these models typically use Grouped Query Attention (GQA) [1], as opposed to standard Multi-Headed Attention (MHA) [36] used by the models we’ve addressed thus far. As mentioned previously, we explicitly address GQA models since GQA has seen broad adoption for LLMs as a way of reducing the size of the KV cache [8, 18, 32, 43]. GQA reduces the memory consumption of the KV cache by sharing Keys and Values amongst a subset of the attention heads. The challenge with extending our methodology to GQA models is that they down-project the input activation when computing the Keys and Values. This means that while the X embeddings have shape l × d (where l is the sequence length and d is the hidden dimension), K and V are l × dg each, where g is the number of query heads that share Keys and Values. For example, the Llama-3.1-8B model[25] has a hidden dimension of 4,096 and uses g = 4. Therefore, X has dimension l ×4K and the Key and Value activations have dimension l × 1K each, so the KV cache is of shape l × 2K. Caching KV would therefore require storing 2 vectors of size 1K each for each token, whereas caching X would require storing a single vector of size 4K for each token. This means that if we naively apply XQUANT to GQA models, we will have 2× memory overhead for

- Figure 5: A diagram outlining how we apply XQUANT for GQA-based models. GQA down-projects the input embedding (X) to a smaller d/g dimension when computing the Keys and Values. Hence, if we naively quantize the input X rather than the KV cache, this will potentially have greater memory consumption. To address this, we first

apply SVD to the Wk and Wv matrices offline. Online during prefill, we down-project X by Uk to get Xk and by Uv to get Xv before applying XQUANT, thereby reducing memory consumption. For generation, each new token is also down-projected into this latent space, appended to the Xk and Xv cache, and quantized. The concatenated [Xk|⃗xk] is multiplied by (ΣkBkT) to recompute the Keys, and the concatenated [Xk|⃗xv] is multiplied by (ΣvBvT) to recompute the values. Note that the group size g is typically greater than or equal to 4, meaning that naively caching X uses greater than or equal to 2× as much memory as simply doing KV caching.

the same precision, which negates the benefits of our approach.

###### 3.3.1 Extending XQUANT to support GQA

To apply XQUANT for models which use GQA, we apply a Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) offline to the weight matrices in order to allow the input activations to be stored in a lower-dimensional latent space. Our algorithm is visualized in Figure 5. We apply SVD to the Wk and Wv matrices to obtain UkΣkBkT and UvΣvBvT, respectively. During prefill, we down-project the input embeddings as XUk and XUv (where Uk and Uv are each d × dg), which lowers the dimensionality of X by 2g and results in the same memory footprint as the GQA KV cache. During generation, each new token’s input activation ⃗x is similarly down-projected by Uk and Uv to get ⃗xk and ⃗xv, respectively. These are appended to the cached XUk and XUv, which are then multiplied by ΣkBkT and ΣvBvT, respectively, to get the Keys and Values. Moreover, ΣkBkT and ΣvBvT are each fused (Σ and BT are multiplied to merge them into a single matrix) to serve as the new weight matrices that the latent Uk and Uv, respectively, are multiplied with to rematerialize the KV cache. This also reduces the recomputation cost during inference, as the fused ΣkBkT and ΣvBvT are smaller square matrices of shape dg × dg. We elaborate on the associated cost in more detail in Section 3.4. Importantly, the SVD and weight fusing are done offline and therefore don’t add any latency overhead.

Importantly, note that while this approach has the same memory consumption as KV quantization for the same bit width, the down-projected X distributions are easier to quantize, giving us higher accuracy for the same bit width (see Section 4.1). In fact, the latent X distributions reveal a very interesting structure: we find that the latent XUk groups all outliers on the first channel, and we observe this for all layers of the model across several different models on different

datasets (see Figures B.2, B.3). Note that we quantize and cache XUk without applying the Σk matrix of singular values. Uk is a matrix with orthonormal columns, so observing this structure in XUk where all the outliers lie on the first channel is very interesting. We do not, however, observe any similar interesting structure in the XUv distribution. This is in keeping with observations made by other works which find that Keys have outlier channels whereas Values do not have a clearly structured axis where outliers lie [23, 15]. We believe that the outliers present in the first channel of XUk are simply distributed to other channels once the latent distribution is transformed by BvT, which gives rise to the outlier channels found in the Keys. We discuss this further in Appendix B. We utilize per-channel quantization for XUk and per-token quantization for XUv, as we find this to be the best configuration resulting in the least accuracy degradation. This is similar to [23, 15] which also quantize the Keys per-channel and Values per-token.

###### 3.3.2 Extending XQUANT-CL to support GQA

We also extend our cross-layer method to support GQA models. For GQA models, XQUANT-CL faces the same issue addressed in Section 3.3.1, specifically that GQA models down-project X of shape l × d to the KV cache of shape l × 2dg. Since ∆X has the same shape as X, naively caching this delta for GQA models results in more memory overhead than storing the KV cache. To address this, we column-wise concatenate the Wk and Wv projection matrices, resulting in Wkv = [Wk|Wv] ∈ Rd×2

is a shared subspace for the individual projection matrices, and ΣkvBkvT is discarded. We down-project ∆X by Ukv, resulting in the same memory footprint as the KV cache, and we quantize and cache this latent distribution. Although

this approach has the same memory consumption as KV quantization, the deltas are easier to quantize despite the latent projection, giving us higher accuracy for the same bit width (see Section 4.3). Crucially, the SVD is performed offline, so there is no additional latency overhead during inference. When computing Xˆi, which is the approximation of X for layer i, we need to merge our accumulator Xˆi−1 of shape l × d with the latent ∆XiUkv. To do this, we up-project ∆XiUkv using UkvT , add this result to the accumulator Xˆi−1, and multiply the updated accumulator Xˆi by Wkv to complete the KV cache rematerialization. One concern is whether up-projecting the latent delta by UkvT is able to retrieve the original delta: for the non-square matrix Wkv, the SVD produces non-square Ukv with orthonormal columns such that UkvT Ukv = I2d

but UkvUkvT ̸= Id. However, when the quantization function Q is the identity

function, up-projecting the latent ∆XiUkv by UkvT is a lossless reconstruction of the original ∆Xi when computing the KV cache for layer i:

[K|V]i = (Xˆi−1 + Q(∆XiUkv) · UkvT ) · UkvΣkvBkvT

where UkvT Ukv = I2d

##### 3.4 System-Level Analysis of Rematerialization

Here, we present system-level modeling that outlines the computational and memory overheads from rematerialization with XQUANT and XQUANT-CL. For this analysis, we count a multiply-accumulate operations as two FLOPs.

Assume we are using a model with hidden dimension d and assume sequence length l. To apply XQUANT on MHA models, the amount of computation required for rematerialization for a single layer is 2 · 2 · l · d2. Suppose that we apply e-bit quantization for X. Then the total number of memory operations in bytes is equal to 8e · l · d; whereas for the KV cache quantization, it would have been 2 · 8e · l · d. To apply XQUANT on GQA models, the amount of computation required for rematerialization for a single layer is 2 · 2 · l · (dg)2, where g is the number of query heads that share Keys and Values. This is a factor of g2 less floating point operations compared to MHA models. Suppose that we apply e-bit quantization for X. Then the total number of memory operations in bytes is equal to 2 · 8e · l · dg, which is the same as KV cache quantization. However, for the same e-bit quantization, XQUANT achieves much higher accuracy than KV cache quantization (see Section 4.1). Equivalently, XQUANT achieves similar accuracy with

a smaller e to KV cache quantization with a larger effective e, meaning that for the same accuracy, XQUANT performs fewer memory operations.

Here, we also provide an example to demonstrate the amount of the rematerialization that can be performed without having the additional compute operations become the latency bottleneck. Here, we assume the NVIDIA H100 GPU as our hardware target, which has a ridge point of P = MemoryPeak FLOPsBW = 756TFLOPs2 TB/s = 378, and we assume that we can overlap the KV cache recomputation with loading the model weights (which corresponds to 2 · 12 · d2 additional memory operations for a single layer for the Llama-2-7B model). We can solve for the maximum amount that we can reconstruct without compute becoming the bottleneck:

2 · 2 · l · d2

P =

(3) Solving this equation for P = 378, d = 4K, and e = 2 gives a maximum sequence length of 2.3K that can be

e 8 · l · d + 2 · 12 · d2

rematerialized without having compute operations become the bottleneck.

We can perform similar analysis for the Llama-3.1-8B model (which requires 2 · 13 · d2 + 2 · 2 · (dg)2 memory operations for the weights for a single layer, including the overhead of loading the Wk/Wv matrices in SVD-decomposed form, and which has g = 4):

2 · 2 · l · (dg)2

P =

(4)

e 8 · l · dg + 2 · 13 · d2 + 2 · 2 · (dg)2

Solving this equation for P = 378, d = 4K, g = 4, and e = 2 gives a maximum sequence length of 40.6K that can be rematerialized without having compute operations become the bottleneck.

With XQUANT-CL, we perform an additional 2 · l · d compute operations for each layer, since we need to add the the cached delta ∆Xˆi to the accumulator Xˆi−1. However, this cost is negligible: if we combine it with the aforementioned rematerialization cost, we get 2·2· l · d2 +2· l · d = 2·2· l · d · (d + 12). XQUANT-CL also requires additional memory operations, as we need to load and store both the accumulator and the cached delta at each layer. Since we keep the accumulator in higher precision, we perform e8b · l · d memory operations in bytes at each layer, where eb is the accumulator’s precision (typically eb = 4 bits; see Section 4.3). Additionally, we perform 8e · l · d memory operations required to load the cached delta, which is the same as XQUANT. For GQA models, since we are caching the quantized down-projected ∆XiUkv at each layer, the number of memory operations for the delta is 2 · 8e · l · dg, which is the same for XQUANT applied on GQA models. After loading this delta, we up-project it by UkvT to merge with the accumulator Xˆi−1, and then apply the Key and Value weight projections onto the updated accumulator. In total, this requires 2 · 4 · l · dg · d compute operations.

### 4 Empirical Results

To evaluate our method, we use the Llama-2-7B/13B, Llama-3.1-8B, and Mistral-7B-v0.3 models [35, 25, 18]. We measure perplexity on the WikiText-2 and C4 datasets [24, 26], and we perform downstream task evaluation on the LongBench and GSM8K datasets [2, 7]. Note that the Llama-2-7B/13B models use MHA, whereas Llama-3.1-8B and Mistral-7B use GQA. We compare our method against KIVI [23] and KVQuant [15], two representative state-of-theart KV cache quantization methods.

For KIVI, we use a stronger baseline (referred to here as KIVI*). The original KIVI method quantizes the Keys after rotary positional embeddings (RoPE) are applied to them [23]. However, [15] finds that applying RoPE to the Keys results in a less structured distribution, whereas the Keys have more structured outlier channels pre-RoPE. We therefore follow [15] and quantize the Keys before applying RoPE.

For KVQuant, we use the best configuration from [15], which performs non-uniform, per-vector dense-and-sparse quantization. KVQuant’s non-uniform quantization requires deriving per-layer sensitivity-weighted non-uniform datatypes from a calibration dataset offline to better represent the distributions. We follow [15] and use 16 calibration samples of sequence length 2K from WikiText-2. The dense-and-sparse quantization isolates outliers separately for each vector and preserves them in higher precision.

Note that XQUANT and XQUANT-CL use simple uniform quantization, with no special outlier handling or calibration required. For the KV cache quantization baselines, we quantize the Keys per-channel and the Values per-token

We provide KV cache size estimates (normalized to the KV cache size of the FP16 baseline) and group rows by similar memory consumption. For MHA models, each group shows XQUANT using slightly less memory compared to KIVI*, as XQUANT only needs to store scale factors and zero points for a single X tensor, whereas KIVI* needs to store the same for K and V.

[23, 15]. We use group size of 128 for all quantization experiments. For generative tasks, in order to be able to leverage per-channel quantization during decoding, we leave the final residual tokens unquantized (up to group size tokens), similar to the residual method in [23]. We adopt this residual method across all generation experiments for fair comparison.

##### 4.1 Main Results

In Table 1, we report perplexity results for Llama-2-7B/13B, Llama-3.1-8B, and Mistral-7B models on WikiText-2 and C4. Perplexity has been measured using teacher forcing with the output logits of all input tokens. For XQUANT applied to MHA models, we apply per-token quantization to X, whereas for KIVI*, we follow [23, 15] and we apply per-channel quantization to the pre-RoPE Keys and per-token quantization to the Values. For XQUANT applied to GQA models, we cache XUk and XUv, and we find that applying per-channel quantization to the latent XUk and per-token quantization to the latent XUv is the best configuration.

Overall, we find that XQUANT not only substantially outperforms KIVI* for the same memory footprint, but it also retains accuracy very close to the FP16 baseline for great memory savings. For the same memory footprint, XQUANT achieves 0.88 and 0.67 less perplexity degradation compared to KIVI* for the Llama-2-7B and Llama-2-13B models, respectively. Relative to the FP16 baseline, XQUANT achieves under 0.1 perplexity degradation, while using 7.7× less memory. Similarly, for GQA models, XQUANT pushes the boundaries of 2-bit quantization by achieving up to less than 2.2 perplexity degradation compared to KIVI* on Llama-3.1-8B. For Mistral-7B, relative to the FP16 baseline, XQUANT achieves < 0.1 perplexity degradation in 3-bit with 5× memory savings, and only 0.01 perplexity degradation in 4-bit with 3.7× memory savings. In 2-bit precision, XQUANT achieves 0.57 less perplexity degradation compared to KIVI*, while getting 7.1× more memory savings relative to the FP16 baseline.

##### 4.2 Downstream Task Evaluation

We also provide cross-task evaluation to demonstrate the applicability of our strategy for a range of downstream tasks. Table 2 provides evaluation on LongBench, a benchmark suite containing a range of long-context length tasks including in-context learning, document Q/A, summarization, and coding tasks. We report XQUANT results for the Llama-2-7B-Chat (MHA) and Llama-3.1-8B (GQA) models, and we also provide baseline comparisons against KIVI* [15]. For Llama-2-7B-Chat, XQUANT-4bit attains the same accuracy as KIVI*-4bit and the same accuracy as the baseline, while providing 2× additional memory compression. For Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, XQUANT provides improved accuracy on average for the same bit width across all precision settings.

We also include results on long-generation reasoning tasks to demonstrate the applicability of our method for complex reasoning. Table 3 provides evaluation for the GSM8K dataset [7] (using lm-eval-harness [9]), which evaluates arithmetic reasoning capabilities. We use the chain-of-thought (CoT) configuration, and we report strict match accuracy. We report results for the Llama-2-7B-Chat model, and we also provide baseline comparisons against KIVI* [15].

- 4.3 Results with Cross-Layer Compression Method

In Table 4, we provide an evaluation for our XQUANT-CL method, which retains near FP16 accuracy while achieving great memory savings with standard asymmetric uniform quantization. We report results for Llama-2-7B/13, Llama3.1-8B, and Mistral-7B-v0.3. We also provide baseline comparisons against KIVI* [23], which also uses asymmetric uniform quantization, and KVQuant [15], which uses non-uniform, per-vector dense-and-sparse quantization (see Section 4.1 for all configuration details). In our results, we list KVQuant as KVQuant-⟨e⟩bit-⟨o⟩%, where ⟨e⟩ is the quantization bit-width and ⟨o⟩% is the percentage of outliers per layer stored in a sparse, high precision format. We use an outlier threshold of 1%, which is the best configuration shown in [15]. Note that for KIVI*, XQUANT, and XQUANT-CL, we keep the first 3 layers in higher precision (4-bit). We find that keeping these early layers in higher precision noticeably mitigates perplexity degradation and also results in a comparable memory footprint with KVQuant, which uses additional memory to keep outliers in higher precision. This is in keeping with the findings of [17] which showed that the first few layers of a network with residual connections do substantial representation

This is done so that these methods have a comparable memory footprint to KVQuant, which stores additional memory for outliers.

learning (large transformations of the input) whereas later layers apply small iterative refinements to the input. Thus, the deltas for the first few layers are harder to quantize, whereas the deltas for the remaining layers of the network are much easier to quantize in low-bit precision. For XQUANT-CL, we use the third layer as the higher-precision base layer which becomes the accumulator.

For Llama-2-7B, relative to the FP16 baseline, XQUANT-CL results in only 0.1 perplexity degradation in 2-bit with 12.5× memory savings, and only 0.01 perplexity degradation in 3-bit with 10× memory savings. Compared to KVQuant-2bit-1%, XQUANT-CL-2bit results in 0.42 less perplexity degradation while using 1.9× less memory. Similarly for Llama-2-13B, XQUANT-CL-2bit achieves 0.23 less perplexity degradation compared to KVQuant-2bit1% on WikiText-2 while using 1.9× less memory. On Llama-3.1-8B, in 2-bit precision, XQUANT-CL retains a perplexity of 10.15 on C4, which is more than 3 points less than KIVI*-2bit (13.54) and more than 1 point less than KVQuant-2bit-1% (11.49). On Mistral-7B, XQUANT-CL-2bit saves 6.7× memory while only facing a perplexity degradation of 0.14 compared to the FP16 baseline on WikiText-2. Impressively, for only a perplexity degradation of 0.12 relative to KVQuant-4bit-1% on WikiText-2, XQUANT-CL-2bit uses 1.8× less memory than KVQuant-4bit-1%. Overall, XQUANT-CL outperforms state-of-the-art KV cache quantization methods for ultra low precision bit widths, achieving near FP16 accuracy with 1.5 − 2× memory savings over KV cache quantization and 6 − 12× memory savings over the FP16 baseline.

- 5 Conclusion

As compute capabilities continue to outpace memory bandwidth and capacity on modern GPU hardware, LLM inference is increasingly becoming more memory-bandwidth bound. In light of this hardware scaling trend, a natural strategy is to perform additional compute operations in order to reduce memory requirements. In this work, we adopt a forward-looking vision to speed up inference of LLMs by exploiting the compute scaling trends on newer generation hardware. Specifically, LLM inference is typically memory-bandwidth bound due to loading the large KV cache when generate each token. To address this, we aim to reduce the memory requirements for LLM inference through reducing the size of the KV cache activations in exchange for higher computation cost, thus reducing the number of memory operations needed to generate each token and speeding up inference. We propose XQUANT, which quantizes the layer input activations in order to reduce memory consumption by 2× relative to KV caching, and rematerializes the Keys and Values on-the-fly during inference. We then extend our basic method and propose XQUANT-CL, which

exploits the cross-layer compressibility of the X embeddings between successive layers. We find that using simple uniform quantization, XQUANT and XQUANT-CL surpass state-of-the-art KV cache quantization methods like KVQuant that use non-uniform quantization and dense-and-sparse quantization, while also retaining accuracy close to the FP16 baseline. Relative to the FP16 baseline, XQUANT achieves under 0.1 perplexity degradation while also using 7.7× less memory for the Llama-2-7B and Llama-2-13B models. XQUANT-CL achieves 12.5× memory savings with only 0.1 perplexity degradation in 2-bit precision, and 10× memory savings with only 0.01 perplexity degradation in 3-bit precision compared to the FP16 baseline. Both XQUANT and XQUANT-CL reduce perplexity degradation by several points compared to KIVI* and KVQuant low-bit precision quantization. With the growing discrepancy between compute and memory capabilities on hardware platforms, rematerialization methods like XQUANT can help exploit the available computation in order to accelerate memory bandwidth-bound LLM inference, while also retaining near FP16 accuracy even in low-bit precision.

##### Limitations

Our work focuses on reducing the memory requirements for LLM inference by quantizing the input X embeddings and rematerializing KV cache activations. While this approach allows for aggressive memory compression with minimal accuracy loss, it requires additional compute operations to perform rematerialization, which may increase latency on particular hardware platforms. Additionally, XQUANT-CL reduces the memory capacity requirements, but it requires additional compute and memory operations in order to rematerialize KV cache activations due to having to load the accumulator. However, in memory-constrained scenarios where the goal is to attain near FP16 accuracy, XQUANT-CL can be an optimal choice.

### A Prefill for XQUANT-CL

Here we include a visualization of the prefill phase of inference for XQUANT-CL. In particular, we show how the deltas between the X embeddings for successive layers are calculated, quantized, and cached. Note that besides Layer 0’s input X0, the input for all other layers is an approximation calculated using the sum of X0 and the previous quantized deltas.

- Figure A.1: Illustration of XQUANT-CL algorithm during prefill. Besides Layer 0, the input to all other layers is a cross layer approximation, computed using the deltas of all previous layers and the input of Layer 0. The input of Layer 0 is summed with each layer’s delta so it can be treated as an accumulator, allowing us to avoid loading all N −1 deltas to compute Layer N’s X. After a layer is done processing, the input embeddings to the layer for all tokens in the sequence are subtracted from the output activations of the layer (the same shape as the input embeddings), and this delta is quantized and cached as ∆Xˆ .

### B Observed Outlier Property When Applying XQUANT for GQA Models

Recap As a reminder, we decompose the Key and Value projection matrices Wk and Wv using the SVD to get UkΣkBkT and UvΣvBvT respectively. We down-project X by Uk and Uv and quantize and cache these latent distributions, while also fusing ΣkBkT into one weight matrix and ΣvBvT into another weight matrix, both of which respectively multiply Uk and Uv to rematerialize the Keys and Values.

Observed Outlier Property When we project X by Uk, we observe an interesting property of these distributions across all layers for all models, where Uk transforms X such that all outliers are grouped on the first channel of the resulting matrix. Although we observe this phenomenon for both MHA and GQA models, we discuss it here in the context of GQA models. This is because down-projecting X by Uk gives us memory savings and is relevant to the XQUANT algorithm for GQA models, whereas for MHA models, we simply cache X itself. We visualize the X, XUk, and XUv distributions for the Llama-3.1-8B and Mistral-7B models in Figures B.2 and B.3 respectively. For each model, we visualize the distributions for 3 different layers on the WikiText-2 and C4 datasets to ensure that this observed property cannot simply be attributed to a specific dataset, model, or layer. Note that these distributions do

> 0. We find that XUk has massive outliers in the first channel across all layers for different models on different datasets (see Figures B.2, B.3). Multiplying XUk by Σk preserves the ordering of outlier channels (first channel still has the largest magnitude outliers). When multiplying XUkΣk by BvT, the first row of BvT interacts with the first outlier channel of XUkΣk, as highlighted in red above. The top-k largest magnitude values from this first row can be used to identify which channels in the Keys are outlier channels. This can be achieved offline without any calibration data, and simply by inspecting the weights of BvT.

not include the scaling term Σ from the SVD – they only visualize each of the transformations that the left singular vectors matrices Uk and Uv with orthonormal columns apply on the input X.

As mentioned in 3.3.1, we notice a pattern in the XUk distributions across all layers of both models, where the first channel has massive outliers across all tokens, whereas all other channels are much smaller in magnitude. We do not, however, observe any similar interesting quality for the XUv distributions. This observation implies that the activation embeddings for all tokens have high cosine similarity with the first column vector of Uk, which is also the left singular vector associated with the largest singular value of Wk. In other words, the activation embeddings for all tokens roughly lie close to the direction where Wk applies maximum scaling.

We attempt to exploit this finding by keeping the first outlier channel of XUk in FP16, while quantizing the remaining channels using per-channel quantization with group-size 128 as before. We use the same setup as discussed in Section 4. These results are shown in Table B.1. The data for KIVI* and XQUANT have been duplicated from Table 1 to serve as a reference point. We find that keeping the outlier channel in FP16 gives non-trivial benefits for 2-bit quantization. For instance, Llama-3.1-8B sees an improvement of 0.2 perplexity on C4 in 2-bit precision.

Connection to KV cache quantization methods Previous KV cache quantization methods such as KVQuant [15] preserve outlier values in the Keys in higher precision to reduce accuracy degradation from quantization. Since the Keys have been observed to have distinct outlier channels (see Figure 3), determining which outliers to preserve in the entire Keys matrix requires finding these outlier channels [23, 15]. To identify these outlier channels, methods like [15] run models on calibration datasets, which allows them to note which channels tend to be outliers across diverse data samples.

Having observed the outlier behavior of the first channel in XUk, we explore if outlier channels in the Keys can be identified by inspecting the SVD decomposition of the Wk matrix offline without the need to run calibration. We follow this line of reasoning: XUk is an ordered distribution where the first channel (i.e., first column) is associated with the largest singular value of Wk, the second channel is associated with the second largest singular value, and so on. If we multiply XUk by Σk, the first channel in XUk gets scaled by the largest singular value σ0, the second channel in XUk gets scaled by the second largest singular value σ1, and so on. This matrix multiplication is visualized in Figure B.1. Thus, XUk · Σk preserves the ordering of the outlier channels (i.e., the first channel in XUk is still the outlier channel). Finally to complete the rematerialization of Keys, (XUkΣk) is multiplied by BvT, which necessarily distributes the outliers in the first channel to other channels. These are the channels that KV cache quantization

- Table B.1: We attempt to exploit the structured distribution of XUk by keeping the first outlier channel in FP16. The table shows XQUANT evaluation using perplexity on WikiText-2 and C4 on Llama-3.1-8B and Mistral-7B. We duplicate the KIVI* and XQUANT results from Table 1 to serve as a reference point. For 2-bit precision, keeping the first channel in FP16 results in some perplexity improvement.

methods try to identify in the Keys distribution via running calibration.

However, we hypothesize that the column in BvT whose first element has the largest magnitude compared to the first element of all other columns will also tend to be the column of the Keys containing the outlier channel. For example, in Figure B.1, the second column of BvT is shown to contain bmax, which is the largest magnitude value in the first row of BvT. This means that the second column of the Keys will tend to be the outlier channel. This is because the values in the first row vector of BvT are the scalars which interact with the first outlier channel in (XUkΣk) when performing matrix multiplication. So, the column in the first row vector of BvT with the largest scalar that "hits" the first column in (XUkΣk) will result in the largest values in the Keys. In Figure B.1, the largest outlier channel σ0X⃗u0 is highlighted in red, and the first row vector in BvT containing the scalars which multiply this outlier channel are also highlighted in red.

However, there are two cases in which the above hypothesis does not hold: 1) other row vectors in BvT contain scalars which cause another channel that is not the first channel in XUk to blow up in magnitude and 2) the largest scalar of BvT’s first row vector results in most values of the outlier channel having an opposite sign to the next largest outlier channel of (XUkΣk), causing their sum to have smaller magnitude. Nevertheless, these scenarios are less likely given that the other channels are themselves much smaller in magnitude than the first channel, so it is unlikely that 1) any other channel could blow up to surpass the first outlier channel in magnitude and 2) adding the first outlier channel to another channel whose elements are the opposite sign will impact the first outlier channel much.

We test this hypothesis by using the above method to determine the outlier channels in the Keys, and then check how many of these predictions are correct by comparing with the ground truth. For the ground truth, we pick the channel in the Keys matrix which has the largest average magnitude. As there can be multiple outlier channels in the Keys, we choose the column indices for the top-k largest magnitude values in the first row of BvT as our predictions. We then simply check if the ground truth index for the outlier channel in the Keys appears in any of the predicted indices by the above method. We mark the predictions as correct if any one of them contain the ground truth index, and we report the final accuracy as the percentage of correct predictions across the Keys for all layers of the model. We test this method on two different datasets, WikiText-2 and C4, to ascertain whether this weights-only based analysis is robust to different data. We also test on the Llama-3.1-8B and Mistral-7B models to check the method’s efficacy across different models. Results are listed in Table B.2.

We find that for Llama-3.1-8B, only 8 of the largest magnitude values of the first of BvT are needed to determine the outlier channel for the Keys. For Mistral-7B, using the top-8 largest magnitude values attains 96.88% accuracy. Moreover, for both models, the accuracy is consistent across datasets, demonstrating the robustness of this method to determine the outlier indices for the Keys.
