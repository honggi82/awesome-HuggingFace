### Abstract

Automated Theorem Proving (ATP) in formal languages is a foundational challenge for AI. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have driven remarkable progress, a significant gap remains between their powerful informal reasoning capabilities and their weak formal proving performance. Recent studies show that the informal accuracy exceeds 80% while formal success remains below 8% on benchmarks like PutnamBench. We argue this gap persists because current state-of-the-art provers, by tightly coupling reasoning and proving, are trained with paradigms that inadvertently punish deep reasoning in favor of shallow, tactic-based strategies. To bridge this fundamental gap, we propose a novel framework that decouples high-level reasoning from low-level proof generation. Our approach utilizes two distinct, specialized models: a powerful, generalpurpose Reasoner to generate diverse, strategic subgoal lemmas, and an efficient Prover to rigorously verify them. This modular design liberates the model’s full reasoning potential and bypasses the pitfalls of end-to-end training. We evaluate our method on a challenging set of post-2000 IMO problems, a problem set on which no prior opensource prover has reported success. Our decoupled framework successfully solves 5 of these problems, demonstrating a significant step towards automated reasoning on exceptionally difficult mathematical challenges. To foster future research, we release our full dataset of generated and verified lemmas for a wide range of IMO problems, available at https://tencent-imo.github.io/.

### 1 Introduction

Automated Theorem Proving (ATP) is the task of automatically generating formal proofs for mathematical or logical statements. By translating problems into a formal language (e.g., Lean (Moura & Ullrich, 2021) or Isabelle (Paulson, 1994)) and iteratively applying tactics within a proof assistant’s environment, an ATP system can construct machine-verified proofs that guarantee logical correctness. This verifiability makes ATP indispensable for the formal verification of critical software and hardware systems, where every reasoning step must be rigorously checked. ATP has long been a foundational challenge in both AI and mathematics, as such systems could leverage massive computational power to help mathematicians evaluate and even solve open conjectures. Recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) have catalyzed rapid progress in ATP. Leveraging techniques such as expert iteration (Polu & Sutskever, 2020), tree search (Li et al., 2024; Wu et al., 2024; Xin et al., 2025; Liang et al., 2025), chain-of-thought reasoning (Xin et al., 2024; Lin et al., 2025), and reinforcement learning, state-of-the-art provers have achieved remarkable performance gains.

However, recent research in the LLM reasoning community has exposed a significant and widening gap between informal reasoning and formal proving capabilities. For instance, a recent evaluation (Dekoninck et al., 2025) on the PutnamBench illustrates this chasm: Top-tier LLMs like Gemini 2.5 Pro can generate informal, natural-language solutions with over 80% accuracy after human verification. In contrast, the best formal prover Deepseek-Prover-V2 671B struggles to solve even 8% of the same problems directly. This highlights a critical dilemma for the field: while LLMs possess immense mathematical reasoning power, their informal outputs lack the rigor and machine-verifiable guarantees required for formal correctness. Conversely, formal ATP systems have this guarantee but lack the raw

problem-solving ability to tackle complex challenges. Bridging this gap is arguably the most pressing challenge in modern ATP. To address this, state-of-the-art provers like DeepSeek-Prover-v2 (Ren et al., 2025) and Kimina (Wang et al., 2025) attempt to integrate reasoning and proving. They generate high-level sketches or subgoals before producing the final formal proof. However, we argue that these approaches suffer from a fundamental design flaw: by tightly coupling high-level planning and low-level proof generation within a single, monolithic model, they inadvertently shackle the model’s full reasoning potential. Its "sketching" is constrained by what its integrated proving component can handle. This inherent limitation prevents them from fully leveraging the powerful informal reasoning capabilities demonstrated on benchmarks like PutnamBench. This, in turn, explains why even these advanced systems still fail on the most difficult problems, such as post-2000 International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) problems.

We identify the root cause of this failure in the prevailing training paradigm: reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). This methodology, used to train models like DeepSeek-Prover-v2 and Kimina, rewards only the final binary success or failure of the generated Lean code. This paradigm is fundamentally misaligned with the goal of bridging the reasoning-proving gap. Instead of rewarding hard-to-define, human-like strategies (the kind that achieve >80% informal success), the RLVR teaches a degenerated policy to maximize reward by any means necessary. It is incentivized to suppress its powerful, latent reasoning abilities in favor of heuristically decomposing goals into trivial sub-problems that can be solved by brute-forcing automatic tactics like ring, omega, or try. This over-reliance is not merely a shortcut, but a symptom of a training-induced degradation of its reasoning capabilities, effectively preventing it from generating the insightful decompositions required for truly difficult problems.

Based on this diagnosis, we propose a new framework built on a foundational principle: the decoupling of high-level reasoning from low-level proof generation. We argue that to bridge the chasm between informal insight and formal correctness, the two processes must be handled by distinct, specialized models scheduled with greater flexibility. Our approach leverages a powerful, general-purpose LLM as a dedicated Reasoner and a separate, efficient ATP model as the Prover. This architectural separation liberates the Reasoner to focus exclusively on its strength—generating high-level mathematical insights and strategic decompositions—while the Prover ensures that the

resulting strategy can be grounded in formal, verifiable logic. It is this principled, decoupled bridge that we believe can finally harness the reasoning power of LLMs for formal theorem proving.

Our simple yet effective pipeline is illustrated in Figure 1. Given a theorem, the Reasoner is first invoked to propose potentially useful lemmas (subgoals), expressed only as formal statements, which act as a bridge between high-level strategy and formal proof. A Prover module then attempts to verify these proposed lemmas, filtering out any that are unprovable. Finally, the Prover tackles the main theorem, now armed with a set of verified lemmas that guide the proof search and significantly reduce its complexity. This contrasts with existing approaches that follow a rigid, one-shot "reasoning-then-proving" trajectory within a single model.

We evaluate our approach on a challenging set of non-geometry IMO problems from 2000 to 2024. To the best of our knowledge, no existing open-source automated theorem prover has reported success on any problem from this set. In the experiemnts, our method successfully solves 5 of these problems: IMO 2000 Problem 2, IMO 2005 Problem 3, IMO 2011 Problem 3, IMO 2019 Problem 1, and IMO 2020 Problem 2.

#### Data Release

To foster further research and collaboration within both the mathematics and ATP communities, we are releasing a comprehensive dataset and a project website. While our framework successfully solved 5 IMO problems, our efforts in subgoal generation and verification have yielded a much larger collection of high-quality, formally verified lemmas for a broad range of post-2000 IMO problems. We believe this resource serves a dual purpose:

- • For mathematicians and IMO researchers, this collection of machine-generated lemmas may offer novel perspectives or reveal non-obvious decompositions, potentially inspiring new human-led proof strategies.
- • For the ATP community, our dataset acts as a new, challenging benchmark. By providing verified intermediate steps, it allows researchers to focus on solving the remaining difficult lemmas or on the final, complex proof-synthesis stage for problems currently beyond reach.

The dataset is publicly available on HuggingFace, and we are committed to its active maintenance and expansion. We welcome community contributions, such as new proofs for existing lemmas or alternative strategic decompositions. The project website, which provides access to the data repository, tracks our ongoing progress, and presents detailed case studies, can be found at https:

### 2 Related Work

The application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to Automated Theorem Proving has evolved rapidly. Early and some recent approaches leverage the powerful sequence modeling capabilities of LLMs to generate entire formal proofs in a single, end-to-end pass. For instance, Baldur (First

- et al., 2023) generates proofs for Isabelle and incorporates a repair mechanism that learns from compiler feedback to correct flawed proofs. Other works, while still operating within a largely monolithic framework, introduce internal structure. POETRY (Wang et al., 2024a) employs a recursive decomposition strategy to break down complex theorems, and LEGO-Prover (Wang
- et al., 2024b) hierarchically proves and reuses lemmas to manage intermediate results within its generation process. These methods treat proof generation as a sophisticated, structured sequence generation task. In contrast, our work argues that coupling high-level reasoning and low-level proof formalization within a single model limits their potential, and we instead advocate for their explicit separation.

Recognizing the limitations of direct generation, a significant line of research has focused on integrating high-level planning or sketching, mimicking human problem-solving strategies. These

methods often generate a natural language plan or a structured sketch before producing the final proof. Kimina-Prover (Wang et al., 2025) achieves strong results by generating structured reasoning patterns prior to the formal proof. Similarly, DeepSeek-Prover-V2 (Ren et al., 2025), the current state-of-the-art, integrates Chain-of-Thought (CoT) style reasoning to guide its recursive subgoal decomposition pipeline. While these methods represent a conceptual step towards our approach by acknowledging the importance of planning, they still tightly couple the planning and proving phases within a single model and a fixed workflow. Our method fundamentally differs by decoupling these two stages into distinct, specialized models, allowing for more flexible and powerful interaction, such as iterative refinement of lemmas before the final proof attempt.

Our work builds upon the high-level philosophy of hierarchical proof generation, sharing conceptual similarities with prior efforts like Draft, Sketch, Prove (Jiang et al., 2023), LEGO-Prover (Wang et al., 2024b), POETRY (Wang et al., 2024a), and Subgoal-XL (Zhao et al., 2024). The most closely related is Draft, Sketch, Prove (Jiang et al., 2023), which also employs a multi-stage pipeline: an LLM first drafts an informal proof, an autoformalizer then translates this draft into a formal sketch, and finally, an external prover completes the proof.

Despite this architectural resemblance, our approach makes a critical design choice that diverges significantly. Instead of attempting to autoformalize an entire unstructured natural language proof—a process that is itself a major research challenge and prone to semantic errors—we task our specialized Reasoner model with a more constrained and impactful objective: generating a diverse set of formal subgoal statements (lemmas). This design offers two key advantages. First, by focusing on generating strategic lemmas rather than full proof steps, we directly leverage the abstract reasoning strength of powerful LLMs to perform creative and non-trivial problem decomposition, which is essential for solving complex problems like those in the IMO competition. Second, by generating formal statements directly and leaving the proof generation to a dedicated Prover, we entirely bypass the fragile and error-prone autoformalization step. This ensures that the bridge between high-level reasoning and formal proving is both robust and precise.

### 3 A Framework for Decoupled Reasoning and Proving

Our methodology is founded on the principle of decoupling high-level strategic reasoning from low-level formal proof generation. This separation allows us to use the best tool for each task: a powerful, general-purpose reasoning model for strategic decomposition, and a specialized, efficient theorem prover for formal verification. The overall workflow, illustrated in Figure 1, consists of three main stages: subgoal generation, subgoal filtering, and final proof construction.

#### 3.1 Stage 1: Strategic Subgoal Generation with a Reasoner

The first stage aims to replicate the most crucial aspect of human mathematical problem-solving: identifying strategic intermediate steps or lemmas. For IMO-level problems, which can require hundreds of proof steps in a formal language like Lean, a brute-force search is intractable. A wellchosen set of lemmas can dramatically prune this search space by decomposing the primary goal into more manageable components.

Our central insight is to leverage a powerful, general-purpose Large Language Model as a dedicated Reasoner, whose sole responsibility is to generate these strategic decompositions. Unlike specialized ATP models trained primarily on code, our Reasoners (e.g., OpenAI-o3, Gemini 2.5, Claude 4 Opus) excel at high-level, semantic understanding and creative problem-solving. We task the Reasoner with generating only the *formal statements of potential lemmas, without their proofs. This deliberate constraint focuses the model on its core strength—strategic thinking—while avoiding the complexities and potential errors of full proof generation.

After evaluating several state-of-the-art models, including OpenAI-o3, Claude 4 Opus and Gemini

- 2.5 Pro, we selected Gemini 2.5 Pro for its superior ability to generate diverse and logically sound subgoals for complex mathematical problems. We use the following prompt, which is designed to encourage deep reasoning before outputting structured Lean statements:

Prompt for Subgoal Generation

You are given a very challenging theorem written in Lean 4. This theorem is too difficult to prove directly. Your task is to think step-by-step to devise a feasible and complete proof strategy for the theorem, and then decompose the original theorem into a sequence of smaller, logically coherent sub-theorems, each of which can be proved more easily.

Important instructions: First, reason through and construct a valid and complete proof strategy for the original theorem.

After the solution path is clear, divide it into intermediate proof steps. Each step should be expressed as a separate sub-theorem in Lean 4, following the same syntactic and semantic format as the original theorem.

The decomposition should reflect deep understanding of the overall proof structure. Avoid trivial splits such as case analysis or mechanical “divide into two cases” tactics unless they are genuinely part of the reasoning process.

Each sub-theorem must represent a meaningful proof milestone — essentially a condensed logical step from the overall proof strategy.

The sub-theorems should be self-contained and provable, and collectively they should imply the original theorem.

Output format: A brief explanation of your proof strategy (in natural language or Lean comments). A list of Lean 4 theorem declarations, each representing a sub-theorem, all starting with ’theorem XXX’ and ending with ’:= by sorry’. Ensure all sub-theorems are expressed using the same formal syntax and conventions as the input theorem. Input Theorem:

To reliably extract the generated lemma statements from the model’s free-form text output, we apply a simple yet robust regular expression. This ensures a clean handoff to the next stage of the pipeline.

Regular Expression for Lemma Extraction theorem (.*?):= by sorry

#### 3.2 Stage 2: Subgoal Verification and Filtering

The second stage acts as a critical filter to ensure that only logically sound and verifiable lemmas are passed to the final stage. This verification step is essential for the overall soundness of our framework. For this task, we employ a dedicated Prover model. The key requirement for this Prover is not high-level reasoning, but rather strong tactical execution and efficiency in proving well-defined, modular goals. We selected DeepSeek-Prover-v2 (7B, CoT version) for this role, as it offers a state-of-the-art balance of proof success rate and computational efficiency. Each candidate lemma generated in Stage 1 is treated as an independent theorem. The Prover attempts to find a proof for it, generating up to k candidate proofs. A lemma is considered "verified" and retained if at least one attempt succeeds.

This filtering process is not merely a correctness check; it is a core component of our decoupled strategy. It allows the Reasoner in Stage 1 to be "creative" and even "speculative," proposing diverse ideas without the immediate burden of provability. The Prover then grounds this creativity in formal rigor, effectively selecting the most promising pathways. We set k (the number of proof candidates) to 128, a value chosen empirically to balance the exploration breadth against computational cost.

#### 3.3 Stage 3: Final Proof Construction

In the final stage, the prover attempts to solve the main theorem by leveraging the set of verified lemmas obtained in Stage 2. These lemmas are prepended to the context of the main problem statement, effectively enriching the problem statement with a suite of pre-proven, reusable components. This process transforms the original, monolithic proof task into a more tractable task of assembling a final proof using these intermediate results as foundational building blocks, as illustrated in Figure 1.

In the final stage, the prover tries to tackle the main theorem with the aid of the set of verified lemmas from Stage 2. These lemmas are prepended to the context of the main problem statement, effectively enriching the problem with powerful, pre-proven tools. This transforms the original, monolithic challenge into a simpler task of assembling a final proof using these new building blocks, as illustrated in Figure 1.

A crucial challenge we identified at this stage was domain shift. We initially hypothesized that the same Prover from Stage 2 (DeepSeek-Prover-v2) would be optimal. However, we observed that this model, when presented with auxiliary lemmas, often struggled to effectively utilize them, likely because its training data did not emphasize this specific pattern of formal proving. It tended to

ignore the provided lemmas and attempt to prove the theorem from scratch, defeating the purpose of our pipeline.

This led to a key insight: the ability to leverage existing lemmas is a distinct skill that not all provers possess equally. After further experimentation, we found that two powerful reasoner models, OpenAI-o3 and Gemini 2.5 Pro, are significantly more adept at integrating and applying the provided lemmas to construct the final proof. This highlights the importance of selecting the right tool for each sub-task in a decoupled system. While we use those reasoners for our final results, a promising direction for future work is to fine-tune specialized provers like DeepSeek-Prover-v2 on a curriculum of problems that explicitly require the use of given lemmas.

### 4 Experiment

We evaluate our approach on challenging problems from the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO), focusing on non-geometry problems from the years 2000 to 2024. Each annual IMO consists of six problems, typically including one geometry problem. We focus on the non-geometry ones, and our method successfully solves 5 of these problems: IMO 2000 Problem 2, IMO 2005 Problem 3, IMO 2011 Problem 3, IMO 2019 Problem 1, and IMO 2020 Problem 2. We list detailed proofs in Appendix B and show current progress on IMO 2024 problems in Appendix A.

#### 4.1 Comparing Reasoning Quality in IMO 2019 Problem 1

To evaluate the qualitative difference between reasoning strategies, we analyze how our framework’s Reasoner compares against existing prover-driven approaches when applied to a challenging benchmark: IMO 2019 Problem 1. This problem asks to find all functions f : Z → Z satisfying f(2a) + 2f(b) = f(f(a + b)) for all integers a, b.

Our goal is to demonstrate that the reasoning path generated by our decoupled Reasoner-Prover framework leads to a principled, structured solution strategy, in stark contrast to prover-only models, which often exhibit brittle or degenerate behavior.

- 4.1.1 Our Reasoner’s Strategic Decomposition

In our framework, the Reasoner is responsible for identifying high-level mathematical structure and generating a roadmap of lemmas. On this problem, the Reasoner produces the following structured decomposition:

- 1. Identify fundamental properties: By strategic instantiation of the functional equation, the Reasoner isolates key identities:

- • prop_f_f_x: f(f(x)) = 2f(x) + f(0) for all x
- • prop_f_2x: f(2x) = 2f(x) − f(0) for all x

- 2. Uncover additive structure: Combining the above, the Reasoner deduces:

• prop_cauchy_like: f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y) − f(0)

- 3. Characterize the function form: Using the Cauchy-like identity, the Reasoner infers:

• cauchy_implies_linear_form: There exists c ∈ Z such that f(x) = cx + f(0)

- 4. Constrain the parameters: Plugging this linear form into prop_f_f_x, the Reasoner derives:

• linear_form_plus_f_f_x_implies_solutions: c must be either 0 or 2

- 5. Verify candidate solutions: Both resulting forms, f(x) = 0 and f(x) = 2x + c, are verified to satisfy the original equation.

This decomposition exhibits genuine mathematical insight: it identifies the functional equation’s additive structure, abstracts useful intermediate results, and uses them to constrain the solution space efficiently and interpretably.

We contrast this with the behavior of current state-of-the-art prover models. Specifically, we sampled three solution attempts from the strongest publicly available model, DeepSeek Prover v2 671B (Ren et al., 2025). These are representative of the general behavior we observed. For brevity, we include only partial code excerpts.

The first attempt relies on a brute-force enumeration of equations. The model instantiates the functional equation on dozens of inputs, creating a large flat pool of algebraic identities, and then invokes tactics such as ring_nf and linarith in hopes of simplification. There is no effort to identify structure or extract reusable intermediate results. The tactic application is purely local and mechanical:

- have h2 := hf 0 0
- have h3 := hf 0 x
- have h4 := hf x 0
- have h5 := hf x (-x)

... have h26 := hf (x + x) (-x) ring_nf at h2 h3 h4 ... h26 ⊢

In the second attempt, the prover tries to assert the final form of the solution—namely f(x) = 2x + f(0)—without having established why f must be linear or what motivates such a guess. It implicitly assumes the desired conclusion and attempts to work backward through aggressive simplification. This reveals a logical gap: the model never proves the Cauchy-like identity nor justifies why a linear form should even be expected.

have h29 : f x = 2 * x + f 0 := by have h291 := hf x 0

... ring_nf at h291 h292 ... ⊢ <;> linarith

The third attempt generates an even larger collection of equation instances, trying all possible combinations of inputs into the original functional equation, and then offloads the burden of reasoning onto a generic decision procedure like omega. Again, no insight is gained; the solution depends entirely on the capacity of low-level tactics to blindly traverse the search space.

- have h31 : f x = 2 * x + (f 0 - 2 * 0) := by
- have h32 := hf 0 0

... have h42 := hf 1 (x - 1)

ring_nf at h32 h33 ... h42 ⊢ omega

These degenerate strategies are a direct consequence of the reward signals guiding the training of prover models. When models are rewarded solely for producing verifiable proofs, they learn to exploit patterns that maximize verification success, not reasoning quality. Brute-force instantiation followed by tactic chains often suffices on simple benchmarks, so models internalize that behavior—even when such strategies fail to scale to Olympiad-level problems. In these more complex settings, the search space is too vast, and the necessary structural insights (such as recognizing the shifted Cauchy identity) cannot be discovered by purely local manipulations.

In contrast, our framework deliberately separates the high-level reasoning process from low-level proof verification. The Reasoner is not constrained by the demands of tactic execution or code generation; it operates at the level of abstraction and mathematical insight. By generating a chain of semantically meaningful lemmas, it defines a proof skeleton that guides the Prover and drastically

reduces the search space. This separation enables the kind of reasoning that mirrors how human mathematicians approach challenging problems: by detecting invariants, proposing transformations, and narrowing the solution space through conceptual understanding. As this case study illustrates, this leads to reasoning that is not only verifiable, but also interpretable, reusable, and robust.

#### 4.2 Degradation of Mathematical Reasoning in Specialised Provers

Motivation. A central hypothesis of our work is that the prevailing reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) paradigm, while effective for optimizing success rates on specific ATP benchmarks, may inadvertently cause a degradation in the model’s intrinsic mathematical reasoning capabilities. The reward signal, being solely dependent on the formal proof’s success, does not explicitly value the quality or correctness of the natural language reasoning that may precede it. To test this hypothesis, we designed an experiment to isolate and measure this potential degradation.

Experimental Setup. We compare the performance of a specialized prover model with its generalpurpose base model on standard mathematical reasoning benchmarks that do not involve formal proof generation. Specifically, we selected:

- • Base Model: Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct, the foundational model upon which the KiminaProver is built, which is highly capable in general mathematical problem-solving.
- • Prover: Kimina-Prover-Preview-Distill-7B, a state-of-the-art prover initialized from Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct and fine-tuned for Lean-based theorem proving.

We evaluated both models on the MATH and AIME benchmarks. We found that with appropriate prompting, Kimina-Prover can still generate high-quality solutions to math problems, rather than generating Lean code. This allowed for a direct comparison of their problem-solving accuracy. We report the pass@k accuracy for both models on AIME24.

The results, presented in Table 1, provide clear evidence supporting our hypothesis. On both benchmarks, the Kimina-Prover exhibits a marked decline in performance compared to its base model. The single-attempt accuracy (pass@1) drops by 4.9 percentage points on MATH and 5.7 points on AIME. Crucially, this performance gap is not an isolated phenomenon but persists robustly across multi-sample evaluations on the challenging AIME dataset. The performance delta remains substantial at pass@4, widens further at pass@8, and is still significant at pass@16. This confirms that the specialization process for formal theorem proving, while boosting performance on ATP tasks, comes at the cost of broader mathematical reasoning skills. This finding strongly motivates our decoupled approach: instead of attempting to force a single model to excel at both high-level reasoning and low-level formalization, we should leverage a dedicated, un-degraded reasoning model for the former, preserving its full intellectual capacity.

#### 4.3 Further Discussions

On the Utilization of External Knowledge: Lemmas vs. have Statements. A critical challenge we encountered during the development of our pipeline was the effective integration of verified subgoals into the final proof stage. We observed a significant behavioral pattern: when verified

subgoals were provided as standalone lemmas in the context, many state-of-the-art provers, including DeepSeek-Prover-v2, tended to ignore them. Instead of leveraging these pre-proven facts, the models often attempted to prove the main theorem from scratch, indicating a form of "contextual blindness" or a bias towards self-contained proof generation learned during their fine-tuning.

The "contextual blindness" phenomenon contrasts with using a have statement within a proof, which forces the model to work with a specific, locally-defined fact (Ren et al., 2025; Cao et al., 2025). However, have statements require strict alignment of symbols and definitions with the current proof state, limiting their flexibility. Standalone lemmas, in theory, offer a more powerful and flexible mechanism for incorporating external knowledge, as they do not impose such rigid constraints. This flexibility is crucial for solving complex problems where reusing established results is key. Our findings suggest that a significant gap exists in the ability of current provers to effectively utilize modular, pre-proven knowledge. A crucial direction for future work is therefore to develop or fine-tune provers to specifically excel at this "proof continuation" task, enabling them to robustly accept and leverage a library of existing theorems and lemmas.

Limitations and Failure Analysis. Our analysis on unsolved statements reveals two primary bottlenecks in the current pipeline, highlighting the remaining gap between our automated system and human-level mathematical ingenuity.

First, the primary mode of failure is the Prover’s inability to verify critical, complex lemmas. For many unsolved problems, our Reasoner successfully identified a plausible high-level strategy, but the constituent lemmas were simply too difficult for the Prover module to handle. To validate this, we conducted an oracle experiment where we manually proved these bottleneck lemmas (or replaced their proofs with sorry). In this idealized setting, our framework was able to solve a significantly larger number of IMO problems. This demonstrates that the performance of the entire pipeline is currently bounded by the raw theorem-proving power of the Prover component. Another potential approach involves further decomposing unresolved lemmas into simpler sub-lemmas to facilitate their proof.

Second, we identified a fundamental difference in the reasoning style of our Reasoner compared to human mathematicians. Through manual inspection of our Reasoner’s outputs against official IMO solutions, we observed that human proofs often hinge on a single, "magical" insight or a clever re-framing of the problem that dramatically simplifies the proof. Our Reasoner, reflecting its LLM nature, excels at systematic, step-by-step decomposition and logical deduction. It is proficient at breaking a problem down into a clear chain of sub-problems but struggles to generate the kind of non-obvious, highly creative leaps that characterize elegant human solutions. This "ingenuity gap" represents a deeper, more fundamental challenge for LLM-based reasoning and is a key bottleneck for our framework on the most difficult problems.

### 5 Conclusion

In this work, we introduce a novel framework for automated theorem proving that addresses a core limitation in current systems: the degradation of mathematical reasoning ability caused by endto-end RLVR training. Our central contribution is the principle of decoupling strategic reasoning from formal proof generation. We achieve this by delegating high-level strategic thinking to a dedicated Reasoner—a powerful, general-purpose LLM whose nuanced reasoning capabilities are often compromised during specialized prover fine-tuning. This Reasoner formulates its strategy as a set of formal subgoal lemmas, providing a more general and powerful mechanism for problem decomposition than restrictive in-proof statements. This modular design ensures proof search is guided by a coherent, human-like plan.

Our evaluation on a challenging set of post-2000 IMO problems, where we successfully solved 5 problems previously unsolved by any open-source prover, provides strong evidence for the efficacy of our decoupled approach. We acknowledge that our current evaluation is limited and that the multi-stage nature of our pipeline presents scalability challenges. A key priority for future work

is to streamline this pipeline to enable comprehensive evaluation on large-scale benchmarks such as miniF2F and ProofNet. Ultimately, we believe that by separating the art of strategy from the science of verification, our work paves the way for more robust, scalable, and insightful automated reasoning systems capable of tackling the frontiers of mathematics.

### A Case Studies on IMO 2024 Problems

This section provides a detailed analysis of our framework’s progress on two problems from the IMO

- 2024. For each problem, we present the main theorem, summarize the key sub-theorems (lemmas) that our framework successfully generated and proved, and identify the critical remaining steps required to complete the full proof.

#### A.1 Analysis of IMO 2024, Problem 1

- A.1.1 Main Theorem

The problem asks to prove the equivalence between a real number a being an even integer and a specific divisibility property holding for all positive integers n.

theorem imo2024_p1 (a : R) :

(∃ m : Z, a = 2 * m) ↔ ∀ n : N, 0 < n → (n : Z) | ∑ i in Finset.Icc 1 n, ⌊i * a⌋

→ := by

The proof naturally splits into two directions:

- • Forward Direction (1) → (2): If a = 2m for some integer m, then the divisibility property holds.
- • Reverse Direction (2) → (1): If the divisibility property holds, then a must be of the form 2m.

- A.1.2 Progress Summary and Key Proven Lemmas

Our framework has made substantial progress on this problem, most notably by completely proving the forward direction and establishing the crucial strategic lemmas for the reverse direction.

Forward Direction: Complete. The framework successfully proved that if a is an even integer, the divisibility property holds. This was accomplished through several lemmas, culminating in a direct proof of the implication.

-- Proved: The forward implication of the main theorem. theorem imo2024_p1_forward_implication (a : R) :

(∃ m : Z, a = 2 * m) → (∀ n : N, 0 < n → (n : Z) | ∑ i in Finset.Icc 1 n, ⌊i * a⌋)

→ := by

Reverse Direction: Key Strategic Lemmas Proven. For the more challenging reverse direction, our system proved two cornerstone lemmas that are essential to the standard human solution strategy.

- 1. Periodicity of the Condition: The framework proved that the divisibility property is periodic with a period of any even integer. This is a powerful strategic result, as it allows reducing the problem for any real number a to an equivalent problem for a number in a bounded interval (e.g., [0,2]).

-- Proved: The divisibility property is periodic by any even integer. theorem divisibility_is_periodic_by_even_integers (a : R) (m : Z) :

(∀ n : N, 0 < n → (n : Z) | ∑ i in Finset.Icc 1 n, ⌊i * a⌋) ↔ (∀ n : N, 0 < n → (n : Z) | ∑ i in Finset.Icc 1 n, ⌊i * (a - 2 * m)⌋) :=

→ by

- 2. Special Case for Integers: The system proved that if a is an integer satisfying the divisibility property, it must be an even integer. This fully resolves the reverse direction for the specific case where a ∈ Z.

-- Proved: An integer satisfying the property must be even. theorem integer_must_be_even (a : Z)

(h_div_int : ∀ n : N, 0 < n → (n : Z) | ∑ i in Finset.Icc 1 n, ⌊(i : R)

→ * (a : R)⌋) : Even a := by

- A.1.3 Analysis of the Remaining Proof Goal

With the forward direction complete and the key periodicity lemma established, the entire proof now hinges on a single, final sub-problem.

The Final Step: Proving the Base Case for the Periodicity. The established lemmas allow us to reason as follows: Assume a real number a satisfies the divisibility property. We can find an integer m such that a′ = a − 2m lies in the interval [−1, 1]. Due to the proven periodicity, a′ must also satisfy the divisibility property. If we can prove that the only number in [−1,1] satisfying the property is 0, it would imply a′ = 0, which means a = 2m, completing the proof.

Therefore, the critical missing lemma is to show that for any number a ∈ [−1, 1] (or a similar interval like (−1,1]), if it satisfies the property, it must be zero.

Critical Missing Lemma Goal: To prove that if a real number a in the interval [−1, 1] satisfies the universal divisibility condition, then a must be 0.

theorem univ_divisibility_in_interval_implies_zero (a : R) (ha_bound : a ∈ Set.Icc

→ (-1) 1) (h_prop : ∀ n : N, 0 < n → (n : Z) | ∑ i in Finset.Icc 1 n, ⌊i * a⌋) : a = 0 := by

Successfully proving this final lemma would allow us to connect all the previously established results and formally complete the entire proof for IMO 2024, Problem 1. Our framework has successfully navigated the problem to its final, decisive step.

#### A.2 Analysis of IMO 2024, Problem 2

- A.2.1 Main Theorem

This problem concerns a property of the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two exponential sequences. It asks to prove that the GCD becoming constant for all sufficiently large n is equivalent to a and b both being 1.

theorem imo2024_p2 (a b : N+) :

(a, b) = (1, 1) ↔ ∃ g N : N+, ∀ n : N, N ≤ n → Nat.gcd (a^n + b) (b^n + a) = g :=

→ by

The proof structure involves a straightforward forward direction and a more complex reverse direction, which is typically solved by considering cases.

- A.2.2 Progress Summary and Key Proven Lemmas

Our framework successfully proved the simple forward direction and made significant headway on the reverse direction by proving the special case where a = b.

Forward Direction: Complete. The framework easily proved that if a = 1 and b = 1, the GCD sequence is constant. In this case, gcd(1n + 1,1n + 1) = gcd(2,2) = 2 for all n, so one can choose g = 2 and N = 1.

-- Proved: The forward implication of the main theorem. theorem imo2024_p2_forward_implication (a b : N+) :

(a, b) = (1, 1) → ∃ g N : N+, ∀ n : N, N ≤ n → Nat.gcd (a^n + b) (b^n + a) = g :=

→ by

Reverse Direction: Special Case a = b Proven. For the reverse direction, the framework identified and fully proved the crucial sub-case where a = b. It correctly deduced that if a = b and the GCD property holds, then a must be 1. The reasoning relies on the fact that if a = b, the GCD is gcd(an + a, an + a) = an + a. For this sequence to be constant for n ≥ N, a cannot be greater than 1.

-- Proved: If a=b and the GCD property holds, then a=1 and b=1. theorem imo2024_p2_bwd_a_eq_b (a b : N+) (h_ab : a = b)

(h_gcd_const : ∃ g N : N+, ∀ n : N, N ≤ n → Nat.gcd (a^n + b) (b^n + a) = g) : (a, b) = (1, 1) := by

This lemma is supported by another proven sub-theorem stating that an exponential sequence like an + a cannot be eventually constant if a > 1.

-- Proved: An exponential sequence is not eventually constant for a > 1. theorem exponential_not_eventually_constant (a : N+) :

a > 1 → ¬∃ g N : N+, ∀ n : N, N ≤ n → a^n + a = g := by

- A.2.3 Analysis of the Remaining Proof Goal

With the forward direction and the a = b case of the reverse direction complete, the entire proof now rests on resolving the case where a ̸= b.

The Final Step: Proving the Case a ̸= b Leads to a Contradiction. The standard human approach for the case a ̸= b (without loss of generality, assume a > b) is to show that the GCD sequence, dn = gcd(an + b, bn + a), cannot be eventually constant if a > 1. A common technique involves using properties of the GCD, such as gcd(X,Y) = gcd(X,Y − kX). Applying this here:

dn = gcd(an + b, bn + a) = gcd(an + b, bn + a − bn−1(an + b)) which simplifies the second term. The key is to show that if a > b ≥ 1, this sequence cannot be constant for large n.

Therefore, the critical missing lemma is to prove by contradiction that if the GCD property holds, the case a ̸= b is impossible unless a = b = 1 (which is already covered).

Critical Missing Lemma Goal: To prove that if a ̸= b, the GCD property cannot hold. A common way is to show that if a > b, the GCD sequence is not constant.

-- This lemma is stated to lead to a contradiction with the main hypothesis. theorem gcd_is_not_eventually_constant_if_unequal (a b : N+) (h_neq : a ̸= b) :

¬(∃ g N : N+, ∀ n : N, N ≤ n → Nat.gcd (a^n + b) (b^n + a) = g) := by

-- A more direct approach to prove is:

-- if a > b >= 1, then the sequence is not constant.

Or, framing it to directly complete the main proof:

-- This lemma, combined with the a=b case, would complete the proof. theorem p2_bwd_dir_a_neq_b (a b : N+) :

(∃ g N : N+, ∀ n : N, N ≤ n → Nat.gcd (a^n + b) (b^n + a) = g) → a ̸= b →

→ False := by

By proving that the GCD property cannot hold for distinct positive integers a and b, our framework would successfully eliminate the only remaining case, thereby completing the proof for IMO 2024, Problem 2.
