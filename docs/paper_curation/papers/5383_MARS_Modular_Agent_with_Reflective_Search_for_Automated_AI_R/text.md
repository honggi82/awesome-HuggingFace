A critical bottleneck in automating AI research is the execution of complex machine learning engineering (MLE) tasks. MLE differs from general software engineering due to computationally expensive evaluation (e.g., model training) and opaque performance attribution. Current LLM-based agents struggle here, often generating monolithic scripts that ignore execution costs and causal factors. We introduce MARS (Modular Agent with Reflective Search), a framework optimized for autonomous AI research. MARS relies on three pillars: (1) Budget-Aware Planning via cost-constrained Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to explicitly balance performance with execution expense; (2) Modular Construction, employing a “Design-Decompose-Implement” pipeline to manage complex research repositories; and (3) Comparative Reflective Memory, which addresses credit assignment by analyzing solution differences to distill highsignal insights. MARS achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source frameworks on MLEBench under comparable settings, maintaining competitiveness with the global leaderboard’s top methods. Furthermore, the system exhibits qualitative “Aha!” moments, where 63% of all utilized lessons originate from cross-branch transfer, demonstrating that the agent effectively generalizes insights across search paths.

Figure 1 | The “Aha!” moment of MARS on the challenging iMet-2020-FGVC7 task. The visualization tracks validation performance gains triggered by specific strategic lessons. While existing methods fail to reach medal-level performance, MARS progressively refines its strategy – evolving from a lightweight residual network to model ensemble techniques – to ultimately achieve a silver medal.

The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into software engineering has fundamentally transformed code generation, evolving from simple auto-completion to autonomous agents capable of resolving GitHub issues Jimenez et al. (2023); Yang et al. (2024) and generating functional scripts (Jiang et al., 2025; Li et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2025). However, while current agents excel at general software maintenance tasks – such as patching bugs or writing unit tests – they face significant hurdles when applied to the domain of Automating AI Research (Chan et al., 2025; Starace et al., 2025; Tian et al., 2024; Wijk et al., 2025; Yamada et al., 2025). A critical bottleneck in this domain is the execution of complex machine learning engineering (MLE) tasks. Unlike standard software

development, where correctness is often binary and verification is computationally cheap, MLE is a probabilistic, resource-intensive endeavor. It requires not only coding intelligence but also the strategic foresight to navigate a landscape defined by computationally expensive evaluations, opaque performance attribution, and high architectural complexity.

Existing agentic frameworks, designed primarily for monolithic code generation, struggle to adapt to these constraints. First, they typically view problem-solving as a purely code-based challenge (Huang et al., 2024; Jiang et al., 2025; Toledo et al., 2026), ignoring the economic reality of research: model training and data processing consume vast computational resources. An agent that improves model accuracy by 0.1% but increases training time from one hour to ten hours is often practically useless, yet standard search algorithms would prioritize it. Second, the monolithic and unstructured scripts often produced by previous LLM agents are fragile and ill-suited for the modular complexity required in research repositories, where data loading, model architecture, and training loops must interact seamlessly. Finally, research progress is iterative and opaque; when a new experiment yields better results, it is difficult to isolate the causal factor. Standard memory-based agents (Ouyang et al., 2026; Packer et al., 2023; Shinn et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2026) lack the mechanism to solve this credit assignment problem, often failing to learn effectively from past trials.

To bridge this gap, we introduce MARS (Modular Agent with Reflective Search), a framework explicitly optimized for the distinct constraints of autonomous scientific discovery. MARS reformulates the research process as a search for an optimal software repository, governed by three core pillars. To address the high cost of evaluation, we employ Budget-Aware Planning via a cost-constrained Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). Unlike general search algorithms, our method explicitly balances performance maximization with execution expense, prioritizing efficient solutions – such as favoring a 1-hour training run over a 4-hour run if performance is comparable – to optimize the discovery rate within a fixed budget. To manage architectural complexity, we replace fragile scripting with a Modular “Design-Decompose-Implement” pipeline. This structure employs specialized agents to architect solutions into independent, testable modules. Finally, to resolve the credit assignment problem, we introduce Comparative Reflective Memory. By analyzing the differences between the current solution and the best-known solution, the agent distills high-signal, causal insights, isolating the specific factors driving performance shifts in a way that standard memory mechanisms cannot. As illustrated in Figure 1, these pillars allow MARS to experience “Aha!” moments during long-horizon exploration, successfully navigating complex optimization landscapes where baselines fail.

Our contributions are summarized as follows:

- • We introduce MARS, a framework aimed at automating AI research by optimizing for complex MLE tasks, featuring a novel combination of Budget-Aware MCTS, a modular implementation pipeline, and Comparative Reflective Memory.
- • We perform extensive evaluation on the MLE-Bench benchmark, where MARS achieves stateof-the-art performance among open-source frameworks under comparable settings. Ablation studies further validate the necessity of each proposed mechanism.
- • We provide qualitative analyses of how MARS drives long-horizon exploration. To facilitate future research, we release prompts in Appendix H, and MARS generated code, trajectories in https://github.com/jfc43/MARS.

#### 2. Related Work

Automated AI Research & MLE Bottleneck. Recent advancements in LLMs have driven ambitious efforts to automate complex, long-horizon AI research (Lu et al., 2024; Pu et al., 2025; Schmidgall et al., 2025; Starace et al., 2025; Tang et al., 2026; Weng et al., 2025; Yamada et al., 2025). Central to

these efforts is the realization that Machine Learning Engineering (MLE) serves as a critical execution bottleneck (Chan et al., 2025; Wijk et al., 2025); without robust autonomous MLE capabilities, higherlevel research automation cannot succeed. While numerous agentic frameworks have been proposed to address these challenges (Jiang et al., 2025; Li et al., 2025; Liu et al., 2025b; Nam et al., 2026; Team et al., 2025; Toledo et al., 2026; Yang et al., 2025; Zhu et al., 2026), existing systems predominantly operate under a monolithic paradigm, generating expansive, single-file scripts. This approach typically results in fragile codebases that lack the modularity essential for rigorous engineering. MARS departs from this by enforcing a repository-level paradigm that systematically decomposes tasks into distinct, testable, and maintainable modules, mirroring the professional software architecture required for scalable AI research.

Search Algorithms in Code Generation. Solving long-horizon AI research problems, where code execution is resource-intensive, necessitates effective search strategies for code optimization. While various algorithms have been adapted for these systems – including greedy search (Jiang et al., 2025), Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) (Kocsis and Szepesvári, 2006; Liu et al., 2025b), and Evolutionary search (Team et al., 2025) – they typically optimize solely for task performance, neglecting computational cost. While recent work has introduced “budget awareness” for tool-augmented agents via external plug-ins (Liu et al., 2025a), such methods are primarily designed for discrete actions like web search. In contrast, we introduce Budget-aware MCTS, which integrates an efficiency-guided reward function directly into the search tree. This allows MARS to balance the exploitation of high-performing strategies with the exploration of novel ideas, penalizing computationally expensive solutions to ensure both performance and efficiency.

Reflective Learning and Memory. Enabling agents to improve iteratively through environmental interaction is a rapidly evolving research area. Early approaches, such as Reflexion (Shinn et al., 2023), focus on self-correction using verbal reinforcement derived from prior mistakes. Recently, the field has expanded to include sophisticated memory and distillation frameworks. For instance, several works explore advanced memory architectures for personalization and associative retrieval Tan et al. (2025); Xu et al. (2026), while others focus on refining process memory and distilling execution traces into stable strategies Forouzandeh et al. (2025); Ouyang et al. (2026); Zhu et al. (2026). Closer to our domain, Zhao et al. identify “good practices” by comparing high-level action trajectories, and Jansen et al. cache useful code blocks for future reuse. MARS advances this paradigm by introducing “Lesson Learning”. Unlike prior methods that summarize execution logs to debug errors or track binary success-failure trajectories, our method explicitly analyzes the causal link between code changes and performance variations. This comparative analysis isolates effective algorithmic changes from confounding factors, distilling high-value insights into a lesson pool to guide future exploration.

Table 1 summarizes the key differences between MARS and existing MLE agent frameworks.

#### 3. Problem

We first formalize the general problem of Long-Horizon Agentic Problem Solving, where an autonomous agent is tasked with constructing a complex artifacts (e.g., a software system) to satisfy a set of requirements within a constrained budget. Let P denote a problem instance defined by the tuple

- P = (I, E, O), where: (1) I represents the Instruction or requirements provided in natural language.

(2) E denotes the Environment with which the agent interacts to validate its solutions. This can be a compiler, a simulator, or a dataset depending on the task scenario. (3) O is the Objective function that quantifies the quality of the solution.

The goal is to find a solution 𝑠∗ that maximizes O by interacting with E, subject to a cost constraint 𝐵 (e.g., time budget or monetary cost):

𝑠∗ = argmax

O(𝑠, E), 𝑠.𝑡. Cost(𝑠) ≤ 𝐵 (1)

𝑠

where the search space for 𝑠 is often vast and unstructured (e.g., the space of all possible Python programs).

MLE Task Scenario. Machine Learning Engineering (MLE) is a representative and challenging instantiation of this general problem class. MLE requires the agent to engineer a full pipeline that processes data, trains models, and validates results. In this scenario, E consists of the provided datasets while O is the performance metric (e.g. accuracy) on the held-out test set. Refer to Appendix B for details.

#### 4. Method

##### 4.1. Overall Framework

We propose MARS, a general agent scaffolding framework designed to enable autonomous agents to solve long-horizon AI Research problems, as illustrated in Figure 2. Formally, we define the problem as a tuple P = (I, E, O), where the agent must follow the instruction I within an environment E to maximize an objective O under a cost budget 𝐵. To address the core challenges of exploration complexity, context management, and solution robustness in this setting, our framework integrates three key capabilities:

- • Modular Construction Strategy: Instead of generating monolithic scripts, we enforce a structured, repository-level software architecture. This paradigm allows for handing complex logic with greater accuracy, efficient code reuse, and improving testability.
- • Comparative Reflective Memory: To overcome context window limitations, we introduce a “Lesson Learning” mechanism that distills high-value, causal insights from past interactions (both successes and failures) into a compact, retrievable knowledge base.
- • Resource-Aware Planning: We employ a budget-aware Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm to systematically explore the solution space. This allows the system to balance the exploitation of promising candidates with the exploration of novel ideas, preventing local optima, and penalize solutions that are costly.

##### 4.2. Modular Decomposition

A primary contribution of this work is the strategic shift from generating monolithic scripts to a Modular Implementation paradigm. This paradigm addresses several inherent limitations of LLM-

- Figure 2 | Overview of the MARS Framework. MARS reformulates long-horizon coding as a search for an optimal software repository. (1) Task Preparation: The agent grounds the abstract problem (Instruction, Environment, Objective) tuple by exploratory analysis of the given dataset and metadata.

(2) The MARS Loop: The agent iteratively evolves solutions through three synergistic modules: (A) Resource-Aware Planning: A Budget-Aware MCTS strategically navigates the search space by selecting actions from {Draft new architecture, Debug runtime errors, Improve a valid solution}. It optimizes an efficiency-guided reward that explicitly balances performance maximization with the penalty of high execution costs. (B) Modular Decomposition: To replace fragile monolithic scripting, the system employs a “Design-Decompose-Implement” pipeline. Specialized {Idea, Modular, Coding} agents architect the solution into independent, testable modules. This structure enables precise Diff-Based Refinement, allowing the agent to update specific logic blocks without regenerating the entire codebase. (C) Reflective Memory: This module distills raw execution logs into structured Debugging and Solution Lessons to proactively prevent error repetition and accelerate convergence in later iterations.

based coding. First, it bypasses token output limits by distributing code across multiple files. Second, it enhances precision; by focusing on smaller logical units, the agent encounters less context noise and can handle complex logic with greater accuracy. Third, it enables efficiency via caching, as validated modules can be reused without regeneration. Finally, it significantly improves testability, as debugging is localized to specific files rather than requiring full-script diagnosis.

We define a node solution 𝑠𝑛 as a tuple comprising a set of 𝑙 independent modules and one orchestration script:

𝑠𝑛 = ⟨{M𝑗}𝑙𝑗=1, 𝜋𝑚𝑎𝑖𝑛⟩ (2)

Each module M𝑗 encapsulates a specific sub-task (e.g., data preprocessing, configuration), while the main script 𝜋main orchestrates the end-to-end pipeline.

To instantiate this structure, we employ a three-stage “Design-Decompose-Implement” workflow:

- • Idea Generation: An Idea Generation Agent articulates a comprehensive natural language plan covering various aspects of the solution.
- • Module Decomposition: A Modular Agent parses the plan and decomposes the solution into logical, independent functional modules.

- • Component Implementation and Debugging: A Coding Agent sequentially implements each module M𝑗, employing a validation script to debug and verify functionality. Once validated, the agent orchestrates the modules via the main script 𝜋main.

To prevent wasteful full-repository regeneration, we adopt a Diff-Based Editing mechanism. Code modifications are structured in a standardized diff format, specifying the target file, the block to replace, and the new code. This enables atomic, multi-file updates in a single inference step.

##### 4.3. Comparative Reflective Memory

Solving complex tasks requires long-horizon exploration, generating extensive interaction trajectories that often exceed context window constraints. More importantly, research progress is inherently iterative and opaque; when a new experiment yields improved results, isolating the specific causal factors remains a challenge. Standard memory-based agents often lack the mechanisms to solve this credit assignment problem, failing to learn effectively from past trials. To address this, we propose Comparative Reflective Memory, a mechanism designed to distill high-signal, causal insights from the exploration process into a compact lesson pool.

Solution Improvement via Comparative Reflection. We employ a two-stage process to resolve the credit assignment problem by synthesizing lessons from valid solutions. First, an Empirical Analysis Agent reviews execution logs to extract objective findings (e.g., metric trends). Subsequently, a Lesson Distillation Agent performs a comparative reflection by analyzing the delta between the current solution and the previous best-known solution. This isolates the specific algorithmic changes driving performance shifts, resulting in a structured lesson containing: (1) The isolated causal change, (2) A comparative impact analysis, and (3) A generalized rule for future iterations.

Debugging Lessons. For failed executions, a dedicated agent analyzes the buggy code, error logs, and the applied fix. It outputs a lesson confirming the fix’s efficacy, explaining the failure logic, and providing guidelines to preemptively identify similar errors.

Lesson Management. To maintain a high-signal lesson pool, a Review Agent evaluates new lessons against the existing pool through LLM-based reasoning, filtering out redundant insights to ensure the retrieved context remains diverse and relevant.

Lesson Utilization. When executing solution improvement or debugging actions, the agent utilizes relevant knowledge from the corresponding lesson categories. We retain the 𝐾𝑚 most recent lessons in the agent’s memory to manage context. To ensure interpretability, the agent is instructed to explicitly cite specific lessons whenever they are applied.

##### 4.4. Budget-Aware MCTS

We adopt the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) framework to explore the solution space, which iterates through four phases: Selection, Expansion, Simulation, and Backpropagation. In this section, we detail our domain-specific modifications: (1) specialized expansion operators, (2) a coherent node selection strategy, and (3) an Efficiency-Guided Reward Function that balances performance with cost. Appendix C provides a review of standard MCTS principles.

- 4.4.1. Actions and Expansion We define three distinct operators to transform a parent state 𝑠𝑝𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡 into a child solution 𝑠𝑛𝑒𝑤:

- • Drafting (Root Expansion): Generates a completely new solution 𝑠𝑛𝑒𝑤 from scratch.
- • Improvement: Applied to valid, executable nodes. The agent modifies the modules and the main script from 𝑠𝑝𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡 to maximize the objective O.
- • Debugging: Applied to nodes where execution failed. The agent inherits the solution structure from 𝑠𝑝𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡 but modifies specific modules or the orchestration script to resolve runtime errors. Buggy children enter an automatic debugging loop with up to 𝑁𝑑 debugging actions to fix the errors.

- 4.4.2. Node Selection

We employ the Upper Confidence Bound for Trees (UCT) algorithm to navigate the solution space, balancing the exploitation of high-performing solutions with the exploration of new solutions.

The selection phase begins at the root node. In each step, we select the child node that maximizes the UCT value. This traversal continues recursively until we identify a candidate node, defined as a node that is not yet “fully expanded”.

The root node is set fully expanded unless any of the follow condition occurs: (1) It does not have any children; (2) the best solution has not been improved after implementing 𝑛𝑠 valid nodes.

If the traversal reaches a leaf node that is already fully expanded (it implies that no further debugging or improvement is permitted for that branch), then the root node is re-activated to allow for new drafts.

The buggy nodes are always set fully expanded. The valid nodes are set fully expanded if they have ≥ 𝑁𝑖 children (attempts to improve).

- 4.4.3. Efficiency-Guided Reward Function

To guide the search efficiently, we design a reward function 𝑅(𝑣) that rewards performance gains and penalizes long execution time. Let 𝑀(𝑣) denote the performance metric of a node 𝑣, and let 𝑡(𝑣) and 𝐿(𝑣) represent its execution time and time limit, respectively. We first normalize the performance metric relative to the history of explored nodes V. Let 𝑀𝑚𝑎𝑥 = max𝑣′∈V 𝑀(𝑣′) and 𝑀𝑚𝑖𝑛 = min𝑣′∈V 𝑀(𝑣′). We define the global normalized score 𝐺(𝑣) as:

𝐺(𝑣) :=

0.5 if 𝑀𝑚𝑎𝑥 = 𝑀𝑚𝑖𝑛, 𝑀(𝑣)−𝑀𝑚𝑖𝑛 𝑀𝑚𝑎𝑥−𝑀𝑚𝑖𝑛 otherwise

(3)

To incorporate budget constraints, we modulate this score by execution latency, defining efficiencyguided reward as:

𝑅(𝑣) := 𝐺(𝑣) · [𝑡(𝑣)/𝐿(𝑣)]𝑤 (4)

Where 𝑤 is a penalty weight hyperparameter. A similar function has been proposed in Tan et al.

(2019).

##### 4.5. Task Specific Components

While MARS is a general framework, its application requires task-specific components. For Machine Learning Engineering (MLE) tasks, we integrate the following:

Task preparation. We employ a multi-agent system to extract task metadata, formalizing the optimization objective and preparing training, validation, and test datasets.

Data analysis. We employ an agent to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to generate a report that guides downstream feature engineering.

Curriculum-Based Exploration. We implement a curriculum-based idea generation strategy that progressively explores simple baselines to complex methods.

Refer to the Appendix D for the details.

#### 5. Experiment

##### 5.1. Setup

Datasets. We evaluate our agent on MLE-Bench (Chan et al., 2025), which consists of 75 challenging competitions from Kaggle, forming a diverse collection of tasks covering natural language processing, computer vision, and tabular data analysis.

Environments. We adhere to the standard MLE-Bench protocol, where agents are allocated a strict 24-hour wall-clock time budget per competition. This budget encompasses the entire pipeline, including dataset preparation, feature engineering, model training, and inference. The experiment for each agent on each competition is conducted on a standard node equipped with one NVIDIA A100 GPU (40GB), 12 vCPUs, 220 GB of RAM, and 1 TB of SSD storage. This setup simulates a realistic, resource-constrained machine learning engineering environment.

Baselines. We compare our method to the agents in the MLE-Bench leaderboard 1 and two state-of-the-art open-source agents: AIDE (Jiang et al., 2025) and AIRA (Toledo et al., 2026). For open-source baselines, we ensure a strictly fair comparison by running them under identical environment configurations and using the same underlying LLMs.

Metrics. Following the standard MLE-Bench evaluation protocol, we report the mean and standard error of the mean (SEM) across three independent runs. Our evaluation focuses on three primary metrics: Above Median Rate (percentage of runs outperforming the median participant), Any Medal Rate (percentage achieving at least a Bronze medal), and Gold Medal Rate (percentage securing a Gold medal).

Hyperparameters. We set the maximum number of lessons in the agent’s memory to 𝐾𝑚 = 30 to maintain relevant context without context window overflow. We allow up to 𝑁𝑑 = 10 debugging actions per failure to resolve runtime errors effectively. The branching factor for valid nodes is set to 𝑁𝑖 = 2, balancing exploration breadth with depth. We set 𝑤 = −0.07 in the reward function (4) following Tan et al. (2019) to penalize excessive execution time.

##### 5.2. Main Results

We compare MARS against state-of-the-art baselines in Table 2. In the controlled evaluation, MARS establishes a new state-of-the-art among open-source frameworks, significantly outperforming AIDE and AIRA-dojo under identical constraints. When compared to the official leaderboard, our method remains highly competitive despite using significantly fewer resources (see Appendix E for setup disparities). Notably, the standard MARS achieves the highest Gold Medal rate (31.1%) among all reported agents. To assess scalability, we evaluate MARS+, a variant configured to execute two concurrent search trees with increased compute (2×H100 GPUs and 48 vCPUs). This scaled approach achieves the highest Above Median rate (74.2%), Gold Medal rate (33.8%), and Any Medal rate (62.7%), outperforming strong competitors like ML-Master 2.0. Finally, Table 3 decomposes performance by task complexity, demonstrating that MARS consistently outperforms baselines across the Lite, Medium, and High splits.

##### 5.3. Ablation Study

We evaluate the individual components of MARS on 22 competitions from the MLE-Bench Lite dataset (Figure 3).

Modular Decomposition. As illustrated in Figure 3a, removing the modular decomposition component degrades the agent’s overall success, validating its ability to reduce context noise and improve testability across independent functional modules.

Memory Mechanisms. Figure 3b highlights the critical importance of our memory architecture. Complete removal of memory mechanisms results in a drastic performance drop. Furthermore, to isolate the specific benefits of comparative distillation, we tested a variant of our method against a baseline utilizing only empirical analysis to distill lessons, without comparing them to the best-known solution. The results demonstrate that the comparative component provides a consistent performance boost. This confirms that code-level comparisons are essential for isolating causal factors. Without this “delta” analysis, the agent often over-generalizes from noisy logs. In contrast, comparative reflective memory allows it to distill precise, actionable heuristics, effectively mirroring human-led ablation experiments.

Tree Search Strategies. Figure 3c compares different tree search algorithms for MARS. While Greedy Search selects the node with the best validation metric for expansion at each step, Vanilla MCTS operates as a variant of Budget-Aware MCTS where 𝑤 = 0 (Eq. 4). The results indicate that the proposed Budget-Aware MCTS consistently yields superior performance over time by effectively

1https://github.com/openai/mle-bench/tree/main

balancing exploration with resource constraints.

Penalty Weight 𝑤. Figure 3d evaluates Budget-Aware MCTS across varying penalty weights. The default setting of 𝑤 = −0.07 proves optimal. Removing the penalty entirely (𝑤 = 0) causes performance degradation, underscoring the importance of penalizing long execution times alongside rewarding performance. Conversely, a stronger penalty (𝑤 = −0.15) excessively biases the reward toward latency, causing the search to prioritize trivial, fast nodes over high-performing ones.

#### 6. Discussions

How does Modular Decomposition impact solution complexity? We investigate whether Modular Decomposition facilitates the construction of complex solutions for each task. Table 4 compares the repository statistics of MARS with and without modular decomposition for the best solution. The results show that the modular approach encourages the generation of more extensive and structured codebases (measured by lines of code and number of files in the best solution). To illustrate this structural adaptability, Table 5 enumerates the specific modules synthesized for five representative competitions. The diversity of these modules – tailored to specific sub-tasks such as preprocessing and model architecture – demonstrates the agent’s ability to decompose intricate problems into logical components. This capacity to architect organized, repository-level solutions closely mirrors professional software engineering workflows.

Does Budget-aware MCTS improve exploration? We examine whether Budget-aware MCTS discovers high-quality solutions more frequently than the Vanilla MCTS. We define the effective solution rate as the proportion of explored solutions that improve upon the current best validation metric per task. Empirically, Budget-aware MCTS achieves an effective solution rate of 19.5% ± 1.5%, notably higher than the 16.1% ± 1.3% observed with Vanilla MCTS. This suggests that the latency penalty acts as a heuristic to prune inefficient trajectories. As illustrated in Figure 4, when the agent encounters solutions with comparable accuracy but differing costs, our efficiency-guided reward favors the faster candidate. This bias directs computational resources toward efficient nodes, accelerating the discovery of optimal solutions within the time limit.

How lessons guide the evolution process? We examine the role of Lesson Learning in guiding the agent’s solution exploration. Figure 1 illustrates an example where the agent formulates lessons

from early failures or partial successes and applies them to refine subsequent solutions. To quantify this behavior, we introduce two metrics: the lesson-utilization rate (the proportion of solutions that incorporate existing lessons) and the lesson-transfer rate (the proportion of utilized solution lessons originating from a different tree branch). MARS achieves a lesson-utilization rate of 65.8% ± 1.1% and a lesson-transfer rate of 63.0% ± 1.8% on MLE-Bench. These results demonstrate that the agent actively leverages learned knowledge and cross-branch transfer to steer the search toward high-quality strategies.

Does MARS follow the MLE-Bench rules? To verify compliance, we employ the official MLE-Bench log analysis tool, which utilizes gpt-4.1-mini to audit the logs and code outputs of all medal-winning submissions. The evaluation confirms that MARS strictly adheres to the protocol, registering a 0% violation rate across all monitored dimensions, including “Tried to access unauthorized resources”, “Tried to call external LLM API service”, and “Manually-written submission”. Furthermore, we assess code originality using the provided plagiarism detection tool based on Dolos (Maertens et al., 2024). We calculate the maximum similarity score between our agent’s code – concatenated into a single file for multi-module repositories – and the top public notebooks for each competition. As shown in

- Figure 5, the similarity distribution of MARS mirrors that of the baseline AIRA-dojo. Crucially, no submission exceeds a 60% similarity threshold, demonstrating that MARS generates distinct, original solutions rather than reproducing existing public code.

Are the Distilled Lessons Causally Correct? To verify whether MARS performs genuine credit assignment, we conducted a systematic evaluation of its distilled lessons. First, we utilized Claude

- 4.6 Sonnet to audit all 3,611 solution lessons generated by Gemini-3-Pro-Preview for causal accuracy. This audit confirmed that 88.34% of the lessons correctly attributed validation metric shifts to specific code changes, rather than relying on hallucinated narratives. Second, we manually inspected a representative subset of 20 lessons. This human evaluation yielded a 90% causal accuracy rate, confirming that the LLM-based audit serves as a reliable proxy for expert judgment. Together, this

analysis provides concrete evidence that our method effectively resolves the credit assignment problem. Qualitative examples demonstrating this are provided in the Appendix G.

Cost Analysis. As detailed in Appendix F.4, maintaining a comprehensive memory context results in a higher cost for the 24-hour version of MARS compared to AIRA-dojo ($60.5 vs. $39.0). However, this investment nearly doubles the Any Medal Rate (from 24.4% to 43.1%). More importantly, a costcontrolled evaluation demonstrates that a 4-hour version of MARS achieves a higher Any Medal Rate (28.4%) while spending significantly less ($9.6) than the 24-hour baselines. This Pareto improvement confirms that our performance gains stem from architectural efficiency rather than simply a larger resource budget.

#### 7. Conclusion

In this work, we addressed the limitations of current autonomous agents in Long-Horizon AI Research by introducing MARS. Unlike traditional code generation approaches, our framework treats research as a rigorous, repository-level engineering challenge. By integrating Resource-Aware Planning via Budget-Aware MCTS, Modular Construction, and Comparative Reflective Memory, MARS effectively resolves the credit assignment problem while balancing exploration with computational efficiency. Our extensive evaluation on MLE-Bench demonstrates that this structured approach – mimicking the strategic foresight of human engineers – enables state-of-the-art performance in complex Machine Learning Engineering tasks. Future work will focus on extending MARS to broader scientific discovery domains and optimizing the framework’s economic viability through advanced context caching and early stopping mechanisms.

#### Impact Statement

MARS contributes to the advancement of autonomous AI agents. While our work aims to enhance the reliability and efficiency of automated software engineering, we acknowledge potential broader impacts. The deployment of LLM-based agents involves risks related to the generation of incorrect or hallucinatory code; we mitigate this through iterative self-correction with code execution feedback. We do not foresee immediate negative societal consequences beyond those generally associated with the advancement of generative AI.

### Appendix

This Appendix is organized as follows: Appendix A discusses the limitations of our work. We then provide background on the MLE task scenario and the standard MCTS algorithm in Appendices B and C, respectively. Next, Appendix D details the instantiation of MARS for MLE tasks, and Appendix E contrasts our evaluation setup with those of prior agents. Finally, we present additional experimental results (Appendix F), qualitative examples of causally correct distilled lessons (Appendix G), comprehensive agent prompts (Appendix H), and representative code examples generated by our system (Appendix I).

#### A. Limitations

While MARS demonstrates significant improvements in autonomous machine learning engineering, we acknowledge several limitations that present important avenues for future research.

Scope of Evaluation. Our evaluation is currently conducted exclusively on the MLE-Bench dataset. While MLE-Bench is a rigorous and comprehensive benchmark for applied ML engineering, it does not encompass the full spectrum of open-ended tasks implied by general “Automated AI Research,” such as novel algorithm formulation, literature synthesis, or deployment in unconstrained real-world environments. Future work should evaluate the framework across a broader range of domains, including research engineering Wijk et al. (2025) and automated research replication Starace et al. (2025), to fully substantiate its broader applicability.

Computational Cost. The current pipeline incurs a notable computational expense. This cost primarily stems from the extensive API calls required for iterative tree search and comparative distillation, which may serve as a barrier to widespread adoption by independent researchers. To mitigate this, future iterations must prioritize inference efficiency. Potential cost-reduction strategies include implementing KV-cache and prompt caching for unchanged modular environments, introducing earlystopping mechanisms within the Budget-Aware MCTS when performance improvements plateau, and routing simpler implementation sub-tasks to smaller, more cost-effective models.

Reliability of Distilled Lessons. Finally, our approach relies on LLMs to deduce causal relationships between code modifications and performance metrics. Consequently, the distilled lessons in the memory pool remain susceptible to hallucinations or misattributions, where the model might incorrectly credit an incidental code change for a performance gain. Although our comparative “delta” analysis significantly mitigates this risk by grounding reflections in specific code diffs, it does not entirely eliminate it. Future frameworks could improve lesson reliability by integrating formal program analysis, cross-model verification, or lesson-confidence scoring based on repeated empirical validation across multiple runs.

#### B. MLE Task Scenario

Machine Learning Engineering (MLE) is a representative and challenging instantiation of this general problem class. MLE requires the agent not just to write a snippet of code, but to engineer a full pipeline that processes data, trains models, and validates results.

We map the general problem P = (I, E, O) to an MLE task 𝑄 = (𝐼, 𝐷, 𝑀), where:

- • 𝐼 corresponds to the natural language task description (I).
- • 𝐷 represents the datasets (𝐷 = {𝐷𝑑𝑒𝑣, 𝐷𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡}) which form the data environment (E).

- • 𝑀 is the evaluation metric (e.g., Accuracy, F1-score) defining the objective (O). Without loss of generality, we treat the optimization of 𝑀 as a maximization problem.

If a pre-defined validation set is not provided in the development set 𝐷𝑑𝑒𝑣, the agent must partition 𝐷𝑑𝑒𝑣 to create a validation set 𝐷𝑣𝑎𝑙 for internal evaluation, as the test set 𝐷𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡 is strictly hidden.

We aim to build an MLE agent A that explores a space of possible solutions and outputs a final executable solution 𝑠. We define the solution 𝑠 as a structured software repository comprising the distinct code modules, dependencies, and entry points required to orchestrate the end-to-end pipeline.

The performance of a solution 𝑠 is quantified by the metric function 𝑓 (𝑠, 𝐷, 𝑀) ∈ ℝ. While the ultimate goal is to maximize performance on the unseen test set 𝐷𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡, the agent must rely on a proxy objective using the validation set 𝐷𝑣𝑎𝑙. The optimization objective becomes:

𝑠∗ = argmax

𝑓 (𝑠, 𝐷𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡, 𝑀), 𝑠.𝑡. 𝐶(𝑠) ≤ 𝑇 (5)

𝑠∈SA

where 𝑇 is the wall-clock time budget, SA is the set of candidate solutions generated by agent A given task 𝑄, and 𝐶(𝑠) denotes the total wall-clock time consumed by the agent to search for the solution 𝑠. Since 𝐷𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡 is unobservable, the agent optimizes via 𝑓 (𝑠, 𝐷𝑣𝑎𝑙, 𝑀).

#### C. Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)

Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is a heuristic search algorithm for decision processes, most notably employed in game play. The algorithm builds a search tree where each node 𝑣 represents a state 𝑠, and each edge represents an action 𝑎 leading to a new state. The value of a state is estimated by simulating outcomes from that state. As shown in Algorithm 1, each MCTS iteration consists of four distinct phases:

- 1. Selection: Starting from the root node 𝑣0, the algorithm recursively traverses down the tree by selecting child nodes according to a selection policy, typically aiming to balance exploration and exploitation. a common strategy is the Upper Confidence Bound for Trees (UCT) Kocsis and Szepesvári (2006):

𝑎∗ = argmax

𝑎∈A(𝑠)

𝑄(𝑠, 𝑎) + 𝑐𝑢𝑐𝑡

√︄ln 𝑁(𝑠) 𝑁(𝑠, 𝑎)

(6)

where 𝑄(𝑠, 𝑎) is the estimated value of taking action 𝑎 in state 𝑠, 𝑁(𝑠) is the total visit count of state 𝑠, 𝑁(𝑠, 𝑎) is the number of times action 𝑎 has been selected from 𝑠, and 𝑐𝑢𝑐𝑡 is a constant controlling the exploration weight.

- 2. Expansion: Once a leaf node 𝑣𝑙 is reached (or a node with unexplored actions), one or more child nodes are added to the tree, representing reachable states from standard actions.
- 3. Simulation: From the newly expanded node, a rollout policy (often random or heuristic-based) is executed to simulate a sequence of actions until a terminal state is reached or a resource limit is met. This produces a reward 𝑅.
- 4. Backpropagation: The reward 𝑅 obtained from the simulation is propagated back up the tree from the leaf to the root. For each node (𝑠, 𝑎) traversed during the selection phase, we update the visit count and value estimate as follows:

𝑁(𝑠, 𝑎) ← 𝑁(𝑠, 𝑎) + 1 (7) 𝑄(𝑠, 𝑎) ← 𝑄(𝑠, 𝑎) +

𝑅 − 𝑄(𝑠, 𝑎) 𝑁(𝑠, 𝑎)

(8)

- Algorithm 1 Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)

- 1: Input: Task P, Time Budget 𝑇.
- 2: Output: Best Solution Node 𝑣∗
- 3: Initialize root node 𝑣0 with empty solution
- 4: 𝑣∗ ← 𝑣0
- 5: while Time used < 𝑇 do
- 6: 𝑣𝑙 ← SELECT(𝑣0) {Tree Traversal using UCT}
- 7: 𝑣𝑛𝑒𝑤 ← EXPAND(𝑣𝑙) {Apply Drafting/Improvement/Debugging}
- 8: 𝑅 ← SIMULATE(𝑣𝑛𝑒𝑤) {Execute and Evaluate Solution}
- 9: BACKPROPAGATE(𝑣𝑛𝑒𝑤, 𝑅) {Update 𝑄 and 𝑁 values}
- 10: if 𝑉𝑎𝑙𝑀𝑒𝑡𝑟𝑖𝑐(𝑣𝑛𝑒𝑤) > 𝑉𝑎𝑙𝑀𝑒𝑡𝑟𝑖𝑐(𝑣∗) then
- 11: 𝑣∗ ← 𝑣𝑛𝑒𝑤
- 12: end if
- 13: end while
- 14: return 𝑣∗

In our MARS framework, we adapt MCTS to the space of automated AI Research. A state 𝑠 corresponds to a partial or complete solution 𝑠𝑛, and actions correspond to modification operators (Drafting, Improvement, Debugging). The reward is derived from the efficiency-guided validation performance.

#### D. MARS for MLE Tasks

In this section, we detail the instantiation of MARS for Machine Learning Engineering (MLE) tasks. The comprehensive procedure is formalized in Algorithm 2. Corresponding instruction prompts for the agents involved are provided in Appendix H.

The workflow initiates by formalizing the optimization objective through task metadata extraction. A Metric Extraction Agent parses the natural language task description I to identify the primary evaluation metric 𝑀 and the optimization direction 𝑑 ∈ {maximize, minimize}.

Simultaneously, a Multi-Agent Subsystem processes the raw data to generate metadata descriptors (e.g., sample IDs) for the training (𝐷𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛), validation (𝐷𝑣𝑎𝑙), and test (𝐷𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡) sets. These metadata descriptors are saved to files for later usage.

To ensure robust evaluation, we employ a strict protocol:

- • Validation Dataset Creation: If a pre-defined validation set is not provided, the agent performs a stratified or group-based split (defaulting to a 80:20 ratio) on 𝐷𝑑𝑒𝑣 to create 𝐷𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛 and 𝐷𝑣𝑎𝑙. This ensures that 𝐷𝑣𝑎𝑙 maintains a distribution 𝑃(𝐷𝑣𝑎𝑙) ≈ 𝑃(𝐷𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛), enabling reliable proxy evaluation.
- • Verification & Documentation: Distinct agents perform key integrity checks (e.g., no leakage between splits) and generate comprehensive documentation describing the data schema and split logic.

Following preparation, a Data Analysis Agent performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on 𝐷𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛. This agent generates a detailed report highlighting data distributions and potential correlations, which serves as a critical reference for feature engineering during the solution exploration. Furthermore, a Search Agent identifies 𝐾𝑎 candidate model architectures across diverse algorithmic families (e.g., gradient-boosted trees, deep neural networks) using web search tools.

Once initialized, MARS enters an iterative Tree Search Stage. In each iteration, a node 𝑣 is selected via the Upper Confidence Bound for Trees (UCT) formula. If the root node is selected, the system enters the Draft Phase; otherwise, it proceeds to the Improvement Phase. Following code generation, a Debugging Loop is triggered to resolve execution errors, after which the results are reviewed, lessons are distilled, and rewards are backpropagated.

Drafting Phase. This phase initializes new branches of the search tree using a curriculum-based strategy that progresses from simple baselines to sophisticated ensembles.

- • Initial Seed: When the solution lesson pool L𝑠𝑜𝑙𝑢𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 is empty, an Initial Idea Generation Agent proposes a solution based on the most lightweight model from the 𝐾𝑎 candidates.
- • Evolutionary Growth: As lessons accumulate, an Idea Improvement Agent formulates advanced proposals by integrating insights from L𝑠𝑜𝑙𝑢𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛.
- • Modular Implementation: A Modular Agent decomposes the proposed idea into independent functional units, which are implemented and unit-tested by a Coding Agent before being orchestrated into a final execution script 𝜋main.

Improvement Phase. This phase focuses on local optimization. An agent analyzes the current solution and its performance metrics to propose targeted, ablation-style modifications. By leveraging the learned lessons in L𝑠𝑜𝑙𝑢𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛, the agent avoids previously identified pitfalls and focuses on high-impact refinements (e.g., hyperparameter tuning or feature engineering).

Debugging Phase. If a candidate node 𝑣𝑛𝑒𝑤 fails execution, the system enters a debugging loop (up to 𝐾𝑑𝑒𝑏𝑢𝑔 attempts). We maintain a dedicated debugging lesson pool L𝑑𝑒𝑏𝑢𝑔 to store error-correction patterns. This prevents the agent from repeating previous mistakes in subsequent iterations.

#### E. Setup for Leaderboard Methods vs. Our Setup

Since MLE-Bench allows for open-ended submissions with varying computational budgets and system architectures, direct comparisons on the official leaderboard can be influenced by hardware disparities. To ensure a fair assessment, we detail the specific hardware, time limits, and auxiliary resources used by top-performing leaderboard agents alongside our own in Table 6. In our Controlled Evaluation (AIDE, AIRA-dojo, and MARS), we standardize the environment to a single A100 GPU node with no external knowledge bases to isolate algorithmic effectiveness from resource scaling.

- F.2. Generalization to Other Models

To demonstrate that the success of MARS stems from its architectural robustness rather than being overly fitted to a specific language model, we conducted a cross-model evaluation utilizing Claude 4.6 Sonnet. The results in Table 10 confirm that MARS maintains a substantial performance advantage over the baseline across all difficulty splits, verifying its efficacy independent of the underlying reasoning engine.

- Table 10 | Model generalizability on MLE-Bench using Claude 4.6 Sonnet. Values represent Any Medal Rate (Mean ± SEM) over three independent runs, evaluated on a random sample (𝑛 = 10 per split) of Lite, Medium, and High tasks.

##### F.3. Ablation Study Results on MLE-Bench Medium and High Splits

Building upon the ablation study conducted on the MLE-Bench Lite split (Section 5.3), we extend our evaluation to include a random sample of 10 tasks each from the Medium and High splits. As illustrated in Figures 6 and 7, the performance advantages provided by our core modules remain highly consistent across these more challenging tasks. Furthermore, the performance gaps between our full method and the ablated variants widen on the harder splits, demonstrating that components like modular decomposition and comparative memory distillation become increasingly essential as task complexity scales.

##### F.4. Cost-Performance Trade-off

- Table 11 | Cost and performance analysis of different agents using Gemini-2.5-Pro. Metrics are averaged across competitions.

Metric AIDE (24 Hour) AIRA-dojo (24 Hour) MARS (4 Hour) MARS (24 Hour)

# API Calls 293.5 ± 18.9 867.0 ± 77.0 122.1 ± 6.0 594.8 ± 35.4 # Input Tokens (×105) 34.6 ± 4.0 128.3 ± 13.2 44.3 ± 8.8 286.6 ± 54.7 # Output Tokens (×105) 6.3 ± 0.5 23.0 ± 2.1 1.2 ± 0.1 6.0 ± 0.4 Price ($) 10.6 ± 0.9 39.0 ± 3.7 9.6 ± 2.2 60.5 ± 13.8 Any Medal Rate (%) 23.1 ± 0.4 24.4 ± 1.2 28.4 ± 1.2 43.1 ± 1.6

In this section, we analyze the computational costs associated with our framework compared to the baselines (Table 11). When operating under the same 24-hour time limit as the baselines, MARS exhibits a distinct resource profile. It achieves the lowest generation volume, producing fewer output tokens (6.0×105) than both baselines and making significantly fewer API calls than AIRA-dojo (594.8 vs. 867.0). However, its input consumption is substantial (286.6×105 tokens) – approximately 2.2 times that of AIRA-dojo. This increase is largely due to maintaining a comprehensive memory context filled with learned lessons and modular structures. Because the Gemini-2.5-Pro model applies premium pricing for long-context prompts (over 200k tokens), the 24-hour version of MARS incurs a higher total cost ($60.5) than AIRA-dojo ($39.0). Crucially, this investment yields substantial returns: the Any Medal Rate increases from 24.4% to 43.1%, justifying the higher expense through superior efficacy.

(c) Comparison of tree search strategies. (d) Effect of the penalty weight 𝑤.

- Figure 7 | Ablation study results on a random sample of 10 tasks from the MLE-Bench High split.

To demonstrate that the performance of MARS is driven by architectural efficiency rather than simply a larger financial budget, we also conducted a cost-controlled evaluation. As shown in Table 11, MARS running under a restricted 4-hour time limit achieves a higher Any Medal Rate (28.4%) while spending less ($9.6) than both 24-hour baselines (AIDE and AIRA-dojo). This Pareto improvement – achieving better results with a smaller budget – directly substantiates our claim that the specific architectural choices of MARS are responsible for the performance gains, not merely an increased allocation of resources.

#### G. Qualitative Examples of Causally Correct Distilled Lessons

In this section, we provide two qualitative examples demonstrating the causal accuracy of the lessons distilled by our framework.

- Example 1: Tabular Playground Series (May 2022). MARS diagnosed a 0.28% AUC performance drop in a Dual-Stream architecture compared to an Early Fusion baseline. By correlating architectural diffs with execution-log overfitting, the agent synthesized a transferable lesson: Early Fusion is superior for heterogeneous tabular data because it preserves low-level cross-modal interactions – such as category-specific continuous thresholds – that independent projection streams discard as an information bottleneck.

- Example 2: Histopathologic Cancer Detection. MARS diagnosed why a multi-model ensemble underperformed (0.976 AUC) against its own single-model component (0.982 AUC). By cross-referencing code with execution logs, it identified a convergence gap: the ConvNeXt model matured significantly faster than the EfficientNet model.The agent’s causal analysis determined that unweighted soft voting diluted the high-quality signals of the lead model with the under-optimized predictions of the weaker one. Instead of simply discarding the result, the agent synthesized a negative constraint: avoid a naive ensemble of disparate performers. This demonstrates the system’s ability to prune the search space by extracting principled heuristics from failed experiments.

#### H. Prompts

This section provides the full suite of instruction prompts utilized by MARS to orchestrate the various agents involved in solving MLE tasks.

##### Metric Parsing Instruction

==== Task ==== Your task is to analyze the provided problem description to identify the

primary evaluation metric and determine if a lower score indicates better performance. Your response must be in a specific JSON format with the following fields:

- - metric_name (string): This field specifies the name of the primary evaluation metric.
- - lower_is_better (boolean): This field indicates whether the metric should be minimized. If a lower value of the metric represents better performance (e.g., for Mean Squared Error), set this to true. If a higher value represents better performance (e.g., for accuracy), set this to false.

# Response Format Your response should be in the following JSON format in a single markdown

code block (wrapped in ```): ```json {{

"metric_name": "accuracy", "lower_is_better": false,

}} ```

##### Metadata Generation Instruction

==== Task ==== Your task is to write a Python script that generates three metadata files

for the training, validation, and test datasets respectively. This metadata (e.g., sample IDs, file paths, labels) will be used by other scripts to load data efficiently.

# Requirements

- - The script's only responsibility is to generate metadata. It should not perform any model training or inference.

- - The script must read raw data from the `./input` directory. This directory should be treated as read-only.
- - All generated metadata files (e.g., .csv, .parquet, .json) must be saved directly to the `./metadata` directory.
- - You must not copy or move the original raw data. The `./metadata` directory should only contain the newly generated metadata files.
- - All file paths stored within the metadata must be relative to the `./ input` directory. Review the Dataset Information section above to identify the correct file paths and structure.
- - The metadata for the training and validation datasets must include the ground-truth labels.
- - Create a validation set by splitting the training data only if a separate validation dataset is not already available.

- - Use a fixed 80:20 ratio (80% training and 20% validation). This ratio should not be a user-configurable argument.
- - Randomly shuffle the training data before splitting. To ensure the split is reproducible, use a fixed random state (`RANDOM_STATE = 42`).
- - Apply stratified sampling or group sampling to ensure the validation dataset's distribution properly represents the original data.
- - Stratified Sampling: Use this if it's a classification task, stratifying by the target label.
- - Group Sampling: Use this if the data has inherent groups (e.g., patient IDs, user IDs) that must not be split across the train and

validation sets.

- - After generating the metadata, the script must immediately load the datasets using the new metadata and perform the following checks:
- - Print summary statistics for the final training, validation, and test datasets (e.g., total number of samples, class distributions, data shapes, number of unique users, etc.).
- - If the metadata contains file paths, programmatically check 1000

relative file paths randomly selected from each of the metadata files. Calculate the ratio of paths that do not resolve to an existing file in `./input`. If this "missing file ratio" is greater than 0.5, the script must raise an error. Before raising the error, print a sample ( e.g., the first five) of the non-resolving file paths to the console for debugging purposes.

- If a new validation set was created, you must programmatically verify that it satisfies the requirements.

- - Assert that the stratification or group split was successful.
- - Raise an error (e.g., AssertionError) if these verification

checks fail. # Implementation Guideline

- - The code should be a single-file python program that is self-contained and can be executed as-is.
- - The script must be complete and able to run from start to finish without premature termination or skipped sections.
- - Your response should only contain a single code block.
- - All validation checks must fail explicitly, either by raising an Exception or triggering an AssertionError.
- - Do not use `try ... except` blocks to suppress or ignore errors in your code examples.

- - Be aware of the running time of the code, it should complete within { exec_timeout}.
- - All the provided input data is stored in "./input" directory. There is no need to unzip any files.

##### Validation Dataset Verification Instruction

==== Task ==== Analyze the provided Python script and its execution output to verify if

the validation dataset was handled or created successfully.

# Python Script {code}

# Execution Output {term_out}

# Requirements You must review the script and output based on the criteria below. Your

entire response must be a single JSON code block.

- Success Criteria: The success field must be set to True if one of the following two conditions is met. Otherwise, set it to False.

- 1. Existing Validation Set: The script correctly identifies that a

separate validation dataset is already available in the raw data (i.e

., no new split is required).

- 2. Created Validation Set: The script correctly creates a new

validation set by splitting the training data. \

Your analysis must confirm that the script's logic properly attempts to create a representative split (e.g., by using stratified or group sampling).

- JSON Response Format: Provide your review in the following JSON format.

- analysis (string): A concise rationale for your decision.

- - If successful: Explain which of the two success criteria was met.
- - If failed: Briefly explain why the script failed to meet either criterion (e.g., "The script split the data randomly instead of using stratification.").

- success (bool): True if the validation dataset was handled or created successfully, False otherwise.

# Response Format The review must be submitted in the following JSON format in a single

markdown code block (wrapped in ```): ```json {{

"analysis": "The validation dataset was not created successfully. The script split the training data but did not use stratified sampling,

failing to create a representative sample.",, "success": false,

}} ```

##### Metadata Documentation Instruction

==== Task ==== Your task is to analyze the provided Python script and its execution

output to create clear documentation for each file generated in the `./metadata` directory.

# Python Script {code}

# Execution Output {term_out}

# Requirements For each file generated in the `./metadata` directory, provide a detailed

breakdown covering:

- - Content and Purpose:

- - Describe the information or data contained within the file (e.g., " Contains image_id, file_path, and label for the training set.").
- - Explain its primary purpose (e.g., "This file is used by the data loader to find image files and match them with their correct labels.").

- - Schema / Structure: Detail the structure, such as column names, data types, and an example row if applicable.
- - Loading Method: Explain the standard method or library function required to load this file (e.g., "Load with pandas.read_csv()" or " Load with joblib.load()").

##### Exploratory Data Analysis Instruction

==== Task ==== Your task is to write a robust Python script to perform an Exploratory

Data Analysis (EDA) on the training dataset. The script must adapt its analysis based on the data modality (Tabular, Image, Audio, or Text). The output should act as a report to inform feature engineering and

preprocessing strategies. # Requirements

- 1. Data Integrity: Ensure all analysis is strictly performed on the training set to prevent data leakage.
- 2. Target Variable Analysis

- - Distribution: Calculate the distribution of the target variable.
- - Imbalance/Skew:
- - If Classification: Calculate class balance ratios.
- - If Regression: Calculate Skewness and Kurtosis to assess normality.

- 3. Input Data Analysis (Modality-Specific)

- - If Tabular Data:

- - Numerical: Report mean, std, min, max, and outlier counts (IQR method).
- - Categorical: Report cardinality; flag columns with > 50 categories or rare labels (< 1 percent frequency).
- - Missing Values: Report count/percentage of NaNs per column.

- - If Image Data:

- - Dimensions: Analyze distributions of Image Widths, Heights, and Aspect Ratios.
- - Channels: Report the distribution of channel counts (e.g., Grayscale vs. RGB).
- - Pixel Stats: Calculate the global mean and standard deviation of pixel values (for normalization).

- - If Audio Data:

- - Signal: Analyze distributions of Duration (seconds), Sampling Rates, and Bit Depths.
- - Channels: Check for mono vs. stereo inconsistency.

- - If Text Data:

- - Lengths: Analyze distribution of sequence lengths (character and word counts).
- - Vocabulary: Report unique vocabulary size and OOV (Out of Vocabulary) potential.

- 4. Feature/Signal Relationships

- - Structured (Tabular) Relationships:

- - Correlation: Pearson/Spearman for numerical; Mutual Information for categorical.
- - Importance: Train a lightweight Random Forest and report top 5

features.

- Redundancy: Report collinear pairs (Correlation > 0.90).

- - Unstructured (Meta-Feature) Relationships: Analyze the relationship between metadata and the target (e.g., "Do longer audio files correlate with specific classes?", "Are larger images associated with higher regression targets?").

- 5. Formatting & Output

- - Organize the output into distinct, capitalized sections.
- - Use f-strings to format floats to 4 decimal places for readability.

##### Model Architecture Search Instruction

==== Task ==== Your task is to propose {num_model_candidates} distinct model

architectures to solve the problem. **Action:** Use Google Search to research state-of-the-art and efficient architectures relevant to this

domain. # Requirements

- - **Broad Diversity:** The candidates must represent different algorithmic families. Do not propose multiple variations of the same underlying method (e.g., do not suggest two different ResNets). Aim for a mix of:

##### Module Implementation Instruction

==== Idea ==== {idea}

==== Python Files ==== The following Python files are already provided. Do not modify them. {library_files}

==== Target File Description ({file_name}) ==== {file_description}

==== Task ====

Your task is to implement the `{file_name}` module based on the

description above. # Requirements

- - Import the functions or classes from the given Python files instead of re-implementing them.
- - Only implement the module class/functions. DO NOT include an if ` __name__ == "__main__":` block. DO NOT implement the end-to-end pipeline.
- - Ensure functions accept arguments for flexibility. You must include hyperparameters to control dataset size (for debugging) and training steps/epochs.
- - When printing validation metrics, please print the full precision without any rounding or formatting.
- - If loading raw data, use the metadata in `./metadata` to identify the correct train/val/test splits.
- - If this module performs deterministic data processing, you must implement a caching mechanism strictly following this logic:

- - **Function Signature:** The processing function must accept a ` load_cached_data: bool` argument.
- - **Directory Safety:** Ensure the directory `./working/{dir_name}/` exists (use `os.makedirs(..., exist_ok=True)`).
- - **Prohibited:** Do NOT use `pickle`. Use `parquet` (via pandas) or ` npy` (via numpy).
- - **Logic Flow:**

- 1. IF `load_cached_data` is True: Try to load the file.
- 2. IF loading fails (file missing or corrupt) OR `

load_cached_data` is False:

- - Compute/process the data from scratch.
- - Save the result to the cache directory `./working/{dir_name }/` for future runs.

3. Return the data.

- - If this module handles model training:

- - **Metrics:** Print key training and validation metrics during training process.
- - **Optimization:** Implement Early Stopping to prevent overfitting and reduce runtime.

- - If this module handles submission generation:
- - Generate predictions for the entire test set. Save the final predictions to `./submission/submission.csv`.
- - Refer to the sample submission file (e.g., `./input/ sample_submission.csv` or `./input/sampleSubmission.csv`) for the correct formatting required by the competition.

##### Module Testing Instruction

==== Python Files ==== The following Python files are already provided. Do not modify them. {library_files}

==== Task ==== Your task is to write code examples demonstrating how to instantiate and

utilize the classes or functions from the provided Python files.

# Requirements

- - Optimize for Speed: Limit hyperparameters (e.g., reduce the number of epochs/steps, use a smaller dataset subset) to ensure the demonstration executes quickly.
- - Verify Logic: Include assertions or validation steps to confirm the correctness of complex classes and functions. \

You may skip verification for trivial components, such as configuration classes.

##### Solution Drafting Instruction

==== Idea ==== {idea}

==== Python Files ==== The following Python files are already provided. Do not modify them. {library_files}

==== Target File Description (`runfile.py`) ==== {file_description}

==== Task ==== Your task is to implement the end-to-end orchestration script `runfile.py

`. This script serves as a **fast baseline** to verify the idea. It must train the model, validate performance, perform failure analysis, and generate a submission.

# Requirements

- - Import the functions or classes from the given Python files instead of re-implementing them.
- - Make the model training fast.

- - Limit maximum number of training samples and training steps/epochs to ensure a quick baseline execution.
- - Set appropriate batch sizes to prevent CUDA out-of-memory errors.

- - After training is complete, you must execute validation assessment, failure analysis, and submission generation.

- - You must load the hold-out validation dataset using the metadata located in the `./metadata` directory.
- - You must print the final validation metric computed on the entire hold-out validation set in this format `Final Validation Metric: < value>`. Without this metric, the solution cannot be evaluated, rendering the entire code invalid. You must use the validation metric defined in the Task Description. Please print the full precision of the validation metric without any rounding or formatting.
- - You must perform failure analysis on the trained model. You must perform failure analysis on the validation set to identify systematic error patterns. Calculate and print the correlation between the model' s error magnitude and the input features to reveal which variables are

most associated with poor performance.

- You must generate predictions for the entire test set and create the submission file{submission_cond}. Save the final predictions to `./submission/submission.csv`. Refer to the sample submission file (e.

g., `./input/sample_submission.csv` or `./input/sampleSubmission.csv`) for the correct formatting required by the competition.

- - Optimize the validation inference speed.

- - Ensure the model is in evaluation mode for this inference.
- - Your code must automatically detect and utilize an available GPU

for inference. Ensure the model and all data batches are moved to the correct device (GPU or CPU).

- During inference, you don't need to compute gradients. Disabling this process reduces memory consumption and speeds up computation.

- - Call data loading functions with `load_cached_data=True` (if applicable) to utilize preprocessed data in the `./working` directory.

##### Solution Improvement Instruction

==== Lessons ==== {lessons}

==== Previous Solution ==== {previous_solution}

==== Task ==== Your task is to modify the Python files from the previous solution to

optimize performance. # Requirements

- - **Do not remove** the following core logic from the original `runfile. py` script:

- Print the final validation metric computed on the entire hold-out validation set.

- - Perform failure analysis on the trained model.
- - Generate predictions for the entire test set and create the

submission file{submission_cond}.

- - The training loss trend (e.g., did it converge/minimize?).
- - Failure analysis.

- - The final validation metric.
- - The reasoning for your `valid_metric` assessment (e.g., "The final

validation metric is valid," or "The final validation metric is invalid due to validation data leakage...").

- - metric (number or null): Report the value of the validation metric here. You must convert percentages to decimals (e.g., 95% -> 0.95). This

should be null if the metric cannot be found or determined.

==== Current Best Solution ==== {best_solution}

==== New Solution ==== {new_solution} ==== Task ==== Your task is to analyze the provided solutions to distill a high-value "

Lesson Learned". # Guidelines

- - **Check Context:**

- - If *Current Best Solution* exists: Comparative Analysis. Contrast the algorithmic approach of the New vs. Current. Explain precisely *

why* the New Solution improves or degrades performance based on the execution results.

- - If *Current Best Solution* is missing: Empirical Analysis. Summarize the findings and effectiveness of the New Solution based on its

execution results.

- - **Logic over Syntax:** Focus on algorithmic choices, data structures, and architectural decisions. Ignore minor syntactic sugar unless it affects performance.
- - **Causal Chain:** Trace the logic to prove exactly how the new approach resolves the specific bottleneck.
- - **Generalizability:** The final lesson must be abstract enough to apply to similar problems in the future, not just this specific snippet.

# Response Format

- - Title: A clear, memorable title for the lesson.
- - Summary: A brief, high-level overview of the methods or algorithmic changes applied in the New Solution.
- - Empirical Findings: Analysis of the execution results. If comparing, highlight the delta in performance (validation metric and execution time) and the specific trade-offs observed.
- - Key Lesson: A standalone, actionable principle. Write this as a heuristic or rule of thumb (e.g., "When handling sparse matrices,

prefer X over Y because..."). If a developer reads *only* this paragraph, they should learn a technique to apply in their own work.

##### Lesson Deduplication Instruction

You are a Machine Learning Engineer responsible for maintaining a knowledge base of technical lessons.

==== Existing Lessons ==== {existing_lessons}

==== New Lesson ==== {new_lesson}

==== Task ==== Your task is to determine if the **New Lesson** is semantically

equivalent to any of the **Existing Lessons**. ### Guidelines

- - **Semantic Overlap:** A lesson is a duplicate if the core insight, principle, or actionable advice is effectively the same, even if the wording differs.
- - **Subsets:** If the **New Lesson** is fully covered by a broader existing lesson, count it as a duplicate.
- - **Novelty:** If the **New Lesson** provides a specific nuance, edge case, or context not covered by existing lessons, it is **not** a duplicate.

# Response Format Provide your analysis in a single valid JSON object inside a single

markdown code block (wrapped in ```).

**Fields:**

- `reasoning` (string): Briefly explain your decision. If a duplicate exists, explicitly quote or summarize the specific existing lesson that overlaps.

- `duplicate` (boolean): Use `true` if it is a duplicate, `false` otherwise.

**Example Output:** ```json {{

"reasoning": "The lesson is the same as one of the existing lessons.", "duplicate": true

}} ```
