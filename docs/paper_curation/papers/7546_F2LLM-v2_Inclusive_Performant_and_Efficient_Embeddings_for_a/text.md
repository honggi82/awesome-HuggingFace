### Abstract

We present F2LLM-v2, a new family of general-purpose, multilingual embedding models in 8 distinct sizes ranging from 80M to 14B. Trained on a newly curated composite of 60 million publicly available high-quality data samples, F2LLM-v2 supports more than 200 languages, with a particular emphasis on previously underserved mid- and lowresource languages. By integrating a two-stage LLM-based embedding training pipeline with matryoshka learning, model pruning, and knowledge distillation techniques, we present models that are far more efficient than previous LLM-based embedding models while retaining competitive performances. Extensive evaluations confirm that F2LLMv2-14B ranks first on 11 MTEB benchmarks, while the smaller models in the family also set a new state of the art for resource-constrained applications. To facilitate opensource embedding model research, we release all models, data, code, and intermediate checkpoints.

### 1 Introduction

Text embedding models serve as the fundamental backbone for a wide array of AI applications, including semantic search, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), text classification, and clustering. By mapping unstructured text into dense vector spaces, these models allow machines to capture complex semantic relationships, enabling efficient and accurate information retrieval and data analysis across massive datasets. This field has recently transitioned from encoder-based architectures (Devlin et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2019; Conneau et al., 2020) to decoder-based LLM embeddings (Zhang

- et al., 2025a; Lee et al., 2025a; Zhang et al., 2025b), benefiting from the extensive reasoning and linguistic capabilities acquired during large-scale pre-training and achieving remarkable gains in performance.

Despite these advancements, the current state of frontier embedding research is characterized by two significant limitations. First, there is a pervasive English-centric bias in both model training and benchmark evaluation. While benchmarks such as MTEB have been instrumental in standardizing evaluation, the high-resource language subsets therein - such as English and Chinese - receive a disproportionately large share of attention, resulting in an abundance of models that are performant in English but fail to provide global utility. Second, a transparency gap has emerged within the research community. Most top-performing embedding models, such as Gemini-Embedding (Lee et al., 2025b) and Qwen3-Embedding (Zhang et al., 2025a), are released either as closed-source APIs or open-weight models without disclosing the underlying training data or methodologies. This lack of transparency hinders reproducibility and limits our collective understanding of how to build truly inclusive, general-purpose embedding systems.

To directly tackle these challenges, we introduce F2LLM-v2, a new family of general-purpose, multilingual embedding models designed to address these critical imbalances. We curate a massive, high-quality training corpus of 60 million samples spanning 282 natural languages and over 40 programming languages solely from publicly available resources. By prioritizing real-world data availability over benchmark-specific optimization, we create a model family that excels across a truly global range of applications, including those involving underserved languages. Besides linguistic inclusivity, we also address computational inclusivity by providing 8 distinct model sizes, ranging from 80M to 14B parameters. By integrating Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) and a two-stage training pipeline enhanced by model pruning and novel knowledge distillation, we ensure high performance even in resource-constrained environments. Extensive evaluations confirm that our 14B model achieves state-of-the-art results on 11 MTEB benchmarks, setting a new standard for multilingual embedding capabilities, while the smaller models also outperform previous frontier models with a similar size. To foster an open and equitable research environment, we release the complete training recipe, intermediate checkpoints, and all associated code and data for the F2LLM-v2 family, aiming to drive progress toward a more inclusive future for AI technology.

### 2 Related Work

The previous generation of encoder-based embedding models witnessed a proliferation of massively multilingual embedding models supporting hundreds of languages, represented by XLM-R (Conneau et al., 2020), mDeBERTaV3 (He et al., 2023), mBART (Liu et al., 2020), and mT5 (Xue et al., 2021). Recently, decoder-based embedding models have become the dominant paradigm, benefiting from their extensive capabilities acquired during large-scale pre-training, as verified by state-of-the-art models such as E5-Mistral (Wang et al., 2024), NV-Embed (Lee et al., 2025a), Qwen3Embedding (Zhang et al., 2025a), and Gemini-Embedding (Lee et al., 2025b).

However, this advancement has been accompanied by a shift toward English-centric evaluation. This is evidenced in MTEB (Muennighoff et al., 2023), which has been established as one of the most recognized text embedding benchmarks, covering over 500 evaluation tasks and more than 250 languages (Enevoldsen et al., 2025). Yet, in reality, the MTEB leaderboards exhibit significant linguistic bias. For instance, in the MTEB-Multilingual benchmark, 35 out of the 131 tasks focus exclusively on English, potentially obscuring a model’s true multilingual efficacy. Furthermore,

Figure 4: Task type distribution in our training data.

The functional diversity of our dataset is equally critical for training a general-purpose embedding model. As shown in Figure 4, our collection encompasses a wide spectrum of tasks, ranging from retrieval-focused question answering and bitext mining to classification-oriented sentiment analysis and intent/domain classification.

To leverage this heterogeneity within a unified contrastive learning framework, we follow the first generation of F2LLM (Zhang et al., 2025b) and consolidate all data into three canonical formats: retrieval, clustering, and two-way classification. This consolidation allows the model to learn a versatile embedding space by optimizing a single, consistent objective across disparate data sources and task structures. For the retrieval format, data consists of (query, positive document, hard negatives) tuples. We leverage both in-batch negatives, where other documents in a mini-batch serve as negatives, and explicitly provided hard negatives (mined using Qwen3-Embedding-8B) to create a challenging and efficient training signal. For the clustering format, which also ingests multi-class classification tasks, tuples are formed by sampling an anchor, a positive example from the same class, and a hard negative from a different class. Finally, the two-way classification format directly uses class labels, where a given text serves as the anchor, the corresponding label text is the positive, and the opposite label text is the negative. For both clustering and classification, only hard negatives are utilized to avoid introducing false negatives from in-batch samples.

#### 3.2 Model Architecture

We train models in 8 distinct sizes: 80M, 160M, 330M, 0.6B, 1.7B, 4B, 8B, and 14B. All models adopt a standard dense Transformer decoder architecture based on Qwen3 (Yang et al., 2025), and utilize the final hidden states of the EOS token as sequence representation. The detailed model configurations are given in Table 1. Models from 0.6B to 14B directly correspond to Qwen3 LLMs, while the 80M, 160M, and 330M models are pruned from the 0.6B model.

#### 3.3 Two-stage Training

We adopt a two-stage training strategy following previous works (Lee et al., 2025a; Zhang et al., 2025a). The first stage focuses on building a robust semantic foundation, and 7 retrieval datasets are selected based on their large scale and broad language coverage, totalling 27 million samples: CodeSearchNet, CodeSearchNet-CCR, OpenCodeGeneticInstruct, WebFAQ, MMARCO, CLIRMatrix, and ParaCrawl (refer to Appendix A for details). Five models (0.6B-14B) are trained in this stage, and we employ the raw data without applying any instructional prefix.

Table 1: F2LLM-v2 model and training configurations.

The second stage aims to sharpen the model’s ability to handle the nuances of diverse downstream applications like classification, reranking, and paraphrase detection. For this stage, we sample at most 80 thousand queries from each data source, producing a mixture of 18 million samples. We apply task-specific instructions to the queries, and also randomly apply instructions to 30% of documents and negatives in tasks where queries and documents are symmetric, including clustering, STS, bitext mining, and paraphrase detection.

Pruning and Knowledge Distillation After stage 1 training, we prune the 0.6B model to three smaller sizes along three dimensions: hidden size, MLP intermediate size, and number of layers. For hidden size and MLP intermediate size, we prune the rows and columns in associated weight matrices based on activation norms on a small set of calibration data. For the layer dimension, we simply keep the first n layers of the model. We also experimented with pruning layers based on the change of activation norms, but found it to underperform this simple method.

After pruning, we find that naive training leads to large performance drops (see Table 4). We mitigate this by applying an additional knowledge distillation loss when training the pruned models, computed by the MSE between the student’s sequence embedding and a teacher’s sequence embedding over input query, document, and negatives. Ablation experiments suggest that this form of knowledge distillation can also benefit larger models, so we apply it to the 0.6B and 1.7B models in the second training stage as well, while the three largest models are trained without distillation due to resource constraints.

All models are trained with AdamW optimizer (Loshchilov & Hutter, 2019). Matryoshka Representation Learning (Kusupati et al., 2022) is applied in both training stages, with a minimum matryoshka dimension of 8. The remaining training hyperparameters are given in Table 1

The main results are presented in Table 2, along with the models’ rankings on the leaderboards. To assess the performance of the smaller models more thoroughly, we also compare specifically with individual models with the same sizes from the Qwen3-Embedding (Zhang et al., 2025a) and EmbeddingGemma (Vera et al., 2025) families in Table 3. As the results of these models are not complete on several benchmarks, we use the results from the leaderboards when available, and evaluate them on the remaining tasks using the same prompts as those used to evaluate F2LLM-v2.

These results highlight the scalability of the F2LLM-v2 models. Our 14B model achieves state-of-theart on 11 of the 17 evaluated benchmarks, capturing deep semantic nuances suitable for enterprisegrade database systems where model inference does not present a bottleneck. In comparison, the smaller variants - particularly the 80M and 160M models - demonstrate remarkable efficiency, which is achieved without a proportional degradation in performance, verifying the effectiveness of our pruning and knowledge distillation pipeline. Notably, the 330M and 0.6B models consistently outperform Qwen3-Embedding and EmbeddingGemma on most language-specific benchmarks

#### 4.2 Ablation Studies

For ablation studies, we conduct experiments on a subset of 350 tasks, which are selected based solely on evaluation time to speed up model iterations.

We first examine the effectiveness of knowledge distillation. Starting from the same stage-1 checkpoints, we train another series of models in identical settings as F2LLM-v2, but without knowledge distillation. The results are presented in Table 4, which demonstrates a consistent drop in performance across all five model scales, verifying the effectiveness of our knowledge distillation method in transferring the capabilities of teacher models into significantly more compact students.

We also verify the effectiveness of MRL by evaluating the models at different representation sizes. For each model, we truncate the output embeddings to dimensions ranging from 8 to their full size and measure performance on the ablation task subset. The results, plotted in Figure 5, confirm that MRL successfully concentrates the most critical semantic information in the initial representation dimensions. Performance scales gracefully with the embedding dimension, with the steepest performance gains occurring at the lower dimensions from 8 to 128 and plateauing as the representation approaches its full size. This demonstrates that the leading dimensions effectively capture the most salient semantic features, while subsequent dimensions add progressively finer-grained detail.

These results highlight a crucial tradeoff for practitioners. For example, the 330M model using its full 896-dimensional embedding performs comparably to the much larger 8B and 14B models when their embeddings are truncated to 32 dimensions. This flexibility enables users to dynamically select an optimal balance between performance, inference cost, and storage cost, showcasing the practical utility of MRL for deploying high-quality embeddings across a wide spectrum of hardware constraints.

### 5 Conclusion

F2LLM-v2 is the latest member of the Codefuse embedding model family (Liao et al., 2024; Zhang

- et al., 2025b; Qin et al., 2025). By addressing the current gaps of language imbalance and training opacity in embedding model research, F2LLM-v2 represents a significant step forward in democratizing high-performance embedding models. With the release of 8 models along with the complete training recipe and intermediate checkpoints, we hope to facilitate transparency in frontier embedding research and contribute to a future with truly global equity in AI technology deployment.

### B Details on MTEB Evaluation

The Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) is widely recognized as the de facto standard for the comprehensive evaluation of text embedding models. Originally introduced by Muennighoff et al. (2023), it was vastly expanded into the Massive Multilingual Text Embedding Benchmark (MMTEB) through a large-scale, open-science collaboration (Enevoldsen et al., 2025). This community-driven effort has established a rigorous and diverse evaluation framework, encompassing over 500 quality-controlled tasks that span more than 250 languages and a wide array of domains.

The significance of MTEB lies in its unprecedented scale and diversity, which addresses the critical limitations of previous benchmarks that were often constrained to a few languages (mostly English), specific domains (e.g., news), or a single task type (e.g., retrieval). To provide a holistic assessment of a model’s capabilities, MTEB organizes its evaluation tasks into ten distinct categories:

- • Retrieval: Assesses a model’s ability to find relevant documents from a large corpus for a given query.
- • Reranking: Measures the ability to reorder a given list of candidate documents by their relevance to a query.
- • Classification: Evaluates performance on standard text classification tasks (e.g., sentiment analysis, topic classification).
- • Clustering: Tests how well embeddings group semantically similar documents together.
- • Pair Classification: Involves predicting the relationship between a pair of texts (e.g., paraphrase detection, natural language inference).
- • Semantic Textual Similarity (STS): Measures the ability to predict the degree of semantic similarity between two sentences on a continuous scale.
- • Bitext Mining: Assesses the ability to identify translated sentence pairs from a collection of sentences in two languages.
- • Summarization: Evaluates the semantic similarity between a model-generated summary and a reference summary.
- • Instruction Reranking: A more challenging reranking variant where the model must follow a detailed natural language instruction to determine relevance.
- • Multilabel Classification: A classification variant where each document can be assigned multiple labels.

The hundreds of tasks are further organized into benchmarks, which are curated subsets of tasks grouped by language, domain, or a combination of both. This includes language-specific benchmarks such as English, Chinese, and Russian; domain-specific benchmarks such as Code and Medical; and aggregated benchmarks like Multilingual, European, and Scandinavian, which test performance across a broad and diverse set of languages. This hierarchical structure allows for both a fine-grained analysis of a model’s performance on a specific language or domain and a high-level view of its overall multilingual and multi-domain capabilities.

In this work, we leverage the breadth of MTEB to provide a robust and thorough evaluation of our models. We evaluate on 17 benchmarks, totaling 430 unique tasks: Multilingual, Code, Medical, English, Russian, French, German, Polish, Dutch, Indic, Persian, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, European, and Scandinavian. This extensive evaluation allows for a robust and finegrained assessment of our models’ capabilities, directly supporting our claims of multilingual inclusivity and broad domain competence.
