### Abstract

Electronic Health Records (EHRs) are integral for storing comprehensive patient medical records, combining structured data (e.g., medications) with detailed clinical notes (e.g., physician notes). These elements are essential for straightforward data retrieval and provide deep, contextual insights into patient care. However, they often suffer from discrepancies due to unintuitive EHR system designs and human errors, posing serious risks to patient safety. To address this, we developed EHRCon, a new dataset and task specifically designed to ensure data consistency between structured tables and unstructured notes in EHRs. EHRCon was crafted in collaboration with healthcare professionals using the MIMIC-III EHR dataset, and includes manual annotations of 4,101 entities across 105 clinical notes checked against database entries for consistency. EHRCon has two versions, one using the original MIMICIII schema, and another using the OMOP CDM schema, in order to increase its applicability and generalizability. Furthermore, leveraging the capabilities of large language models, we introduce CheckEHR, a novel framework for verifying the consistency between clinical notes and database tables. CheckEHR utilizes an eight-stage process and shows promising results in both few-shot and zero-shot settings. The code is available at https://github.com/dustn1259/EHRCon.

### 1 Introduction

Electronic Health Records (EHRs) are digital datasets comprising the rich information of a patient’s medical history within hospitals. These records integrate both structured data (e.g., medications, diagnoses) and detailed clinical notes (e.g., physician notes). The structured data facilitates straightforward retrieval and analysis of essential information, while clinical notes provide in-depth, contextual insights into the patient’s condition. These two forms of data are interconnected and provide complementary information throughout the diagnostic and treatment processes. For example, a practitioner might start by reviewing test results stored in the database, then determine a diagnosis and formulate a treatment plan, which are documented in the clinical notes. These notes are subsequently used to update the structured data in the database.

However, inconsistencies can arise between the two sets of data for several reasons. One primary issue is that EHR interfaces are often designed with a focus on administrative and financial tasks, which makes it difficult to accurately document clinical information [32]. Additionally, overburdened practitioners might unintentionally introduce errors by importing incorrect medication lists, copying and pasting outdated records, or entering inaccurate test results [4, 24, 38]. These errors can lead

- Figure 1: Examples of consistent and inconsistent data between clinical notes and EHR tables: An inconsistent example (datetime) is when a clinical note records an HR (abbreviation for heart rate) of 167 on “2022-02-02” but the EHR table shows the same HR on “2022-02-06”. A consistent example is when both the clinical note and the EHR table document the administration of Atorvastatin with matching drug name, dosage, and unit. Another example of inconsistency occurs when a clinical note mentions a hypertension diagnosis, but the EHR table lacks this information.

to significant discrepancies between the structured data and clinical notes in the EHR, potentially jeopardizing patient safety and leading to legal complications [3].

Manual scrutiny of these records is both time-intensive and costly, underscoring the necessity for automated interventions. Despite the need for automated systems, previous studies on consistency check between tables and text have primarily focused on single claims and small-scale single tables [1, 7, 8, 35]. These approaches are not designed for the complex and large-scale nature of EHRs, which require more comprehensive and scalable solutions.

To this end, we propose a new task and dataset called EHRCon, which is designed to verify the consistency between clinical notes and large-scale relational databases in EHRs. We collaborated closely with practitioners2 to design labeling instructions based on their insights and expertise, authentically reflecting real hospital environments. Based on these labeling instructions, trained human annotators used the MIMIC-III EHR dataset [15] to manually compare 4,101 entities mentioned in 105 clinical notes against corresponding table contents, annotating them for CONSISTENT or INCONSISTENT as illustrated in Figure 1. Our dataset also offers interpretability by including detailed information about the specific tables and columns where inconsistencies occurred. Moreover, it contains two versions, one based on the original MIMIC-III schema, and another based on its OMOP CDM [34] implementation, allowing us to incorporate various schema types and enhance the generalizability.

Additionally, we introduce CheckEHR, a framework that leverages the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to verify consistency between clinical notes and tables in EHRs. CheckEHR comprises eight sequential stages, enabling it to address complex tasks in both few-shot and zero-shot settings. Experimental results indicate that in a few-shot setting, our framework achieves a recall performance of 61.06% on MIMIC-III and 54.36% on OMOP. In a zero-shot setting, it achieves a recall performance of 52.39% on MIMIC-III. Additionally, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies to thoroughly analyze the contributions of each component within CheckEHR.

Consistency Check Fact verification involves assessing the truthfulness of claims by comparing them to evidence [13, 18, 23, 26–31, 33]. This task is similar to ours as it involves checking for consistency between two sets of data. Among the various datasets, those utilizing tables as evidence are particularly relevant. TabFact [7], a prominent dataset for table-based fact verification, focuses on verifying claims by reasoning with Wikipedia tables. Additionally, INFOTABS [8] uses info-boxes from Wikipedia, and SEM-TAB-FACTS [35] utilizes tables from scientific articles. Furthermore, FEVEROUS [1] is a dataset designed to verify claims by reasoning over both text and tables from Wikipedia. While these datasets focus on verifying individual claims with small-scale tables (e.g., most 50 rows), our methodology differs significantly. We handle entire clinical notes where multiple claims must be first recognized, then perform consistency checks against a larger heterogeneous relational database (i.e., 13 tables each with up to 330M rows). This requires a more comprehensive and scalable solution for fact verification. Consequently, our work extends beyond previous studies, presenting a novel task in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) as well as healthcare.

Compositional Reasoning Large Language Models (LLMs) [2, 6, 20, 21] have demonstrated remarkable abilities in handling a wide range of tasks with just a few examples in the prompts (i.e., in-context learning). However, some complex tasks remain challenging when tackled through in-context learning alone. To address these challenges, researchers have developed methods to break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable sub-tasks [16, 19, 39]. These decomposition techniques have also been applied to tasks that involve reasoning from structured data [12, 17, 36]. One significant development is StructGPT [12], which enables LLMs to gather evidence and reason using structured data to answer questions. Inspired by these decomposition techniques, CheckEHR improves the accuracy and efficiency of consistency checks between clinical notes and tables, effectively overcoming the limitations of in-context learning methods.

### 3 EHRCon

EHRCon includes annotations for 4,101 entities extracted from 105 randomly selected clinical notes, evaluated against 13 tables within the MIMIC-III database [15].3 MIMIC-III contains data from approximately 40,000 ICU patients treated at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center between 2001 and 2012, encompassing both structured information and textual records. To enhance standardization, we also utilize the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM)4 version of MIMIC-III. OMOP CDM, a publicly developed data standard designed to unify the format and content of observational data for efficient and reliable biomedical research. In this regard, developing the OMOP version of EHRCon will be highly beneficial for future research scalability. In this section, we detail the process of designing the labeling instructions (Sec. 3.1), and labeling the dataset (Sec. 3.3) on MIMIC-III dataset. The labeling for the OMOP CDM version and detailed data preparation steps are provided in Appendix B.

#### 3.1 Labeling Instructions

To reflect actual hospital environments, practitioners and AI researchers collaboratively designed the labeling instructions. The following are the three important aspects of the labeling instruction, and more detailed instructions can be found in Appendix C.

Labels We classify the entities as either CONSISTENT or INCONSISTENT based on their alignment with the tables. This approach is fundamentally different from traditional fact-checking methods, which typically determine whether claims are SUPPORTED or REFUTED using texts or tables as definitive evidence. In contrast, in the context of EHR, both tables and clinical notes can contain errors, making it impossible to define one as definitive evidence. Therefore, a more flexible approach is used by labeling them as CONSISTENT or INCONSISTENT. An entity is labeled as CONSISTENT if all related information, such as values and dates in the note, matches exactly with the tables. Conversely, if even one value differs, it is labeled as INCONSISTENT.

- 3Although MIMIC-IV [14] is more recent than MIMIC-III, we use MIMIC-III in this work because MIMICIV lacks diverse note types (such as physician notes and nursing notes), and is missing all dates in notes for de-identification, as opposed to shifting the dates in MIMIC-III notes.

- Figure 2: Annotation process of EHRCon: The annotation process involves annotators reviewing clinical notes, identifying and classifying entities into Type 1 and Type 2, and extracting relevant information to generate and execute SQL queries. If the SQL queries yield no results, conditions (e.g., value or time) are masked to pinpoint where the inconsistency occurred. When annotators encounter corner cases, they update the labeling instructions through discussion. After all labeling is complete, a post-processing phase is conducted to ensure high-quality data.

Definition of Entity Types We categorized the entities in the notes into two main types for labeling. First, entities with numerical values, such as “WBC 10.0”, are defined as Type 1. Second, entities without values but whose existence can be verified in the database, such as “Vancomycin was started.”, are labeled as Type 2. In our study, we did not label entities with string values because they can be represented in various ways within a database. For example, the phrase “BP was stable.” might be shown in a value column as “Stable” or “Normal”, or it might be indicated by numeric values in the database. This variability can lead to labeling errors. However, to support future research, we included them as Type 3 entities in our dataset, but did not use them in the main experiments.

Time Expression Clinical notes contain various time expressions, so we manually analyzed the time expressions in these notes (see Appendix D). As a result, we found that they can be categorized into three groups: 1) event time written in a standard time format, 2) event time described in a narrative style, and 3) time information of the event not written. When an entity is presented in the standard date and time format (i.e., YYYY-MM-DD, YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS), we validate whether a clinical event occurred exactly at that timestamp. For narrative-style expressions, such as “around the time of patient admission” or “shortly after discharge”, we consider records within the day before and after the specified date to account for the approximate nature of the timing. In cases where no precise time information is provided, we determine the relevant time frame based on the type of the note. For instance, in discharge summaries, we examine the entire admission period, while for physician and nursing notes, we check the records within one day before and after the chart date.

#### 3.2 Item Search Tool

Clinical notes can include a mix of abbreviations (e.g., Temp vs. Temperature), common names (e.g., White Count vs. White Blood Cells), and brand names (e.g., Tylenol vs. Acetaminophen) depending on the context and the practitioner’s preference. This discrepancy causes issues where the entities noted in the clinical notes do not match exactly with the items in the database. To resolve this, we developed a tool to search for database items related to the note entities.

To create a set E of database items related to the entity e, we followed a detailed approach. First, we used the C4-WSRS medical abbreviation dataset [25] to gather a thorough list of abbreviation-full

name pairs. Then, we utilized GPT-4 (0613) [20]5 to extract medication brand names from clinical notes and convert them to their generic names. By combining these methods, we built an extensive set V , which includes abbreviations, full names, brand names, and generic names associated with the entity e. Finally, to create the set E, we calculated the bi-gram cosine similarity scores between the elements in V and the items in our database, retrieving those that exceeded a specific threshold.

#### 3.3 Annotation Process

In this section, we explain the data annotation process depicted in Figure 2. Annotators begin by carefully reviewing the clinical notes, utilizing web searches and discussions with GPT-4 (0613). Through this process, they identify entities and relevant information within the notes. Subsequently, the identified entities are classified into Type 1 and Type 2, as outlined in Sec. 3.1 (Figure 2-(1)). For each entity, annotators use the Item Search Tool (Sec. 3.2) to find the relevant items in the database (Figure 2-(2)). They then select the items and tables associated with the entity. If none of the retrieved items match the entity, the annotators manually find and match the appropriate items. Following this, the annotators extract information related to the entity from the notes (e.g., dates, values, units) and use them to generate SQL queries, as explained in Appendix P (Figure 2-(3)). Finally, the annotators execute the generated queries and review the results to label the entity as either CONSISTENT or INCONSISTENT (Figure 2-(4)). If a query yields no results, the SQL conditions are sequentially masked and executed to pinpoint the source of the inconsistency (Figure 2-(4)-2). Also, when the annotators encounter a corner case that is not addressed in the existing instructions, they update the instructions after thorough discussion (Figure 2-(5)). Upon completing all annotations, the annotators engaged in a post-processing phase to ensure high-quality data. This phase involved additional annotation of entities according to the final labeling instructions, as well as the removal of any misaligned entities (Figure 2-(6)). We implemented additional quality control processes to ensure high-quality. For more details on these processes, see Appendix E.

#### 3.4 Statistics

Inconsistencies Found in Notes As seen in Table 1, discharge summaries account for a significant portion of inconsistent cases, with 727 out of 1,168 total cases. Unlike nursing and physician notes, which document clinical events as they occur, discharge summaries are written at the time of discharge and summarize major events and treatments. This timing could potentially increase the likelihood of errors. Given the pivotal role discharge summaries play in hospitals such as during inpatient-outpatient transitions [5], inconsistencies in these notes can negatively impact patient care.

Inconsistencies Found in Tables We found 36.55% of inconsistencies in the labevents table and 17.58% in medication-related tables (e.g., prescriptions). These data are crucial for patient care, and such discrepancies can lead to misdiagnosis and inaccurate medication administration, potentially resulting in patient death [9, 22]. Therefore, implementing automated consistency checks is important to ensure data accuracy and consistency.

Inconsistencies Found in Columns An in-depth analysis revealed that 56.16% of discrepancies are related to time, with 58.23% of these temporal inconsistencies involving a one-hour difference between tables and clinical notes, possibly due to issues in the EHR system [37]. This suggests that the discrepancy could result from not only human but also software issues. For a more detailed analysis, refer to Appendix F.

- 4 CheckEHR

CheckEHR is a novel framework designed to automatically verify the consistency between clinical notes and a relational database. As depicted in Figure 3, CheckEHR encompasses eight sequential stages: Note Segmentation, Named Entity Recognition (NER), Time Filtering, Table Identification, Pseudo Table Creation, Self Correction, Value Reformatting, and Query Generation. All stages utilize the in-context learning method with a few examples to maximize the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs). The prompts for each step are included in Appendix G.

Note Segmentation LLMs face significant challenges in processing long clinical notes due to its limitations in handling extensive context lengths. To overcome this challenge, we propose a new scalable method called Note Segmentation, which divides the entire clinical note into smaller sub-texts that each focus on a specific topic. The following outlines the process of creating a set T ,

composed of sub-texts from clinical note P. First, the text P is divided into two parts: P0f, containing the first l tokens, and the remaining text, P0b. Then, P0f is segmented by the LLM into n sub-texts, each with its own distinct topic: {P0f,1, P0f,2, ..., P0f,n}.6 The sub-texts from P0f,1 to P0f,n−1 are added to the set T . Since P0f,n is likely incomplete due to the l token limit, it is concatenated with P0b for further segmentation. The combined text of P0f,n and P0b is referred to as P1. This segmentation continues until the length of Pi is l tokens or less, at which point Pi is added to T . To ensure smooth transitions, each sub-text includes some content from adjacent sub-texts. The algorithm and conceptual figure of Note Segmentation are detailed in Appendix H.

Named Entity Recognition Our task takes the entire text as input, making the extraction of named entities essential for consistency checks. In this task, the LLM extracts entities related to the 13 tables, focusing on those with clear numeric values, and those whose existence can be verified in the database even without explicit values.7 This selective extraction is crucial for maintaining the accuracy and reliability of our checks.

- 6l is determined by the context length of the LLM. In this study, l was set to 1000 and n to 3.
- 7Narrowing down the NER target like this might seem like taking advantage of our knowledge from the dataset construction process. However, we would like to emphasize that the scope of named entities is part of the task definition, and it is essential to share this information with the model so that the model at least understands the objective.

Time Filtering At this stage, the LLM determines whether the time expression of a clinical event is in a specific time format, written in a narrative style, or if the time is not specified. The results from this step are utilized for generating queries at the last stage.

Table Identification To create a pseudo table in the next stage, it is essential to identify the relevant tables related to the entities. At this stage, the LLM uses table descriptions, foreign key relationships, and just two example rows to identify the necessary table names.

Pseudo Table Creation Since clinical notes include content that cannot be easily verified through tables, the LLM creates a pseudo table to effectively extract table-related information. The LLM extracts the information through a multi-step process as follows: First, extracts sentences from the clinical note that contain the entity to verify. Then, analyzes the extracted sentences to determine the time information of the entity. Finally, completes the pseudo table by extracting information about the remaining columns (e.g., value, unit) from the notes, using the previously obtained information. Examples of the detailed process for creating the pseudo table can be found in Appendix I.

Self Correction During the construction of the pseudo table, we found that hallucinations by the LLM were frequent (see Appendix J). For example, there were instances where the LLM generated unit information that was not present in the notes. To address this issue, the LLM re-evaluates whether the pseudo table created in the previous stage is directly aligned with the notes. We then use only the results that are actually aligned.

Value Reformatting In clinical notes and tables, the same information may be expressed differently. For instance, a clinical note might mention ‘admission’, while the table might record the admission date as ‘2022-02-02’. To align the data types between the generated pseudo table and the actual table, the LLM reformats the pseudo table by using the schema information.

Query Generation Using the results from the Time Filtering and Value Reformatting, the LLM creates an SQL query. This query is executed against the database to check if the content mentioned in the notes matches the actual database content. During execution, we replace the entity in the SQL query with items retrieved from the database. This process involves leveraging the Item Search Tool (see Sec. 3.2) to cover both medication brand names and their corresponding abbreviations.

### 5 Experiments

#### 5.1 Experimental Setting

Base LLMs We aim to conduct an evaluation of our EHRCon and our proposed framework CheckEHR. For this evaluation, we utilized Tulu2 70B [10], Mixtral 8X7B [11], Llama-3 70B8, and GPT-

- 3.5 (0613) [21] as the base LLMs within our framework. To effectively measure CheckEHR’s performance, experiments were conducted under both few-shot and zero-shot settings.

Note Pre-processing We filtered out information from the notes that is difficult to confirm from the tables (e.g., pre-admission history) to focus on the current admission records (see Appendix B.1.1). All experiments used these processed notes, with results using the unfiltered original notes available

- in Appendix K.

Metrics We evaluate CheckEHR’s performance for each note using Precision, Recall and Intersection, then calculate the average across all notes. Precision is the number of correctly classified entities divided by the number of all recognized entities9 in the note. Recall is the number of correctly classified entities divided by the number of all human-labeled entities in the note. Intersection is the number of correctly classified entities divided by the number of correctly recognized entities in the note. Note that we use Intersection to assess how well CheckEHR performs at least for the correctly recognized entities, considering the difficulty of NER. Details on the experiment setups are

- in Appendix L.

8https://llama.meta.com/llama3 9Note that CheckEHR must first recognize entities in the notes during the NER stage before classifying them

as CONSISTENT or INCONSISTENT.

#### 5.2 Results

Table 2 presents the results of our framework for both the few-shot and zero-shot settings. Notably, using GPT-3.5 (0613) as the base LLM in the few-shot scenario achieves the best result, with a recall of 61.06%, precision of 48.63%, and an intersection score of 86.25%. This result demonstrates significantly improved performance compared to the direct use of GPT-3.510, which had a recall of 10.12% and a precision of 8.75%.

However, despite the carefully crafted 8-stage CheckEHR framework, the overall recall scores remain in the 40-60% range, underscoring the inherent difficulty of the task. This challenge is further underscored by the significant gaps between recall and intersection, and between precision and intersection. Such discrepancies indicate the difficulty of NER in our task. Despite providing the model all the entity extraction criteria defined for the task during the NER stage, both recall and precision performance remains low. This suggests that LLMs lack capabilities required to comprehend clinical notes and accurately extract only the entities that meet the criteria.

Furthermore, in our comparative analysis of zero-shot and few-shot performance, we observed significant improvements with few-shot examples in models like Tulu2, Mixtral, and GPT-3.5 (0613). However, Llama-3 exhibits similar performance in both zero-shot and few-shot settings. Interestingly, few-shot samples improves Llama-3’s performance for discharge summaries and physician notes, but degrades for nursing notes. This suggests that Llama-3 struggles to derive general patterns from in-context examples, particularly in more unstructured formats. Discharge summaries and physician notes typically contain semi-structured patterns (e.g., “[2022-02-02 04:06:00] WBC - 9.6”), making it easier for models to generalize from in-context examples. In contrast, nursing notes are often written in free-form text, presenting a challenge for Llama-3 to generalize effectively from few-shot samples.

10We provided GPT-3.5 (0613) with all the necessary information (e.g., column name, table name, column descriptions) for verification and conducted the consistency check directly.

#### 5.3 Result in MIMIC-OMOP

The MIMIC-III database stores various clinical events in multiple tables like “chartevents” and “labevents”, while the OMOP CDM organizes these events into standardized tables such as the “measurements” table, facilitating multi-organization biomedical research. Additionally, MIMIC-III

uses a variety of dictionary tables (e.g., d_items, d_icd_diagnoses), while the OMOP CDM uses only the “concept” table for this purpose (see Appendix B.2.1). This characteristic of the OMOP CDM simplifies table identification and item search within the database, leading us to anticipate superior performance of MIMIC-OMOP over MIMIC-III. Contrary to our expectations, however, the performance on MIMIC-OMOP was found to be similar to or lower than that of MIMIC, as shown in

- Table 3. To understand this discrepancy, we conducted an analysis based on entity types (see Sec. 3.1) and discovered that a significant performance drop occurred with Type 1 entities. This decline was mainly caused by the complexity of entities within the MIMIC-OMOP database. MIMIC-OMOP includes detailed and diverse information related to specific entity names, such as “Cipralex 10mg tablets (Sigma Pharmaceuticals Plc) 28 tablets”, encompassing value, unit, and other related details all at once. Our findings indicate the necessity for developing a framework that can freely interact with the database to overcome these challenges in future research. The detailed experimental results for each type of OMOP and MIMIC-III can be found in Appendix M.

#### 5.4 Component Analysis

For evaluating the role of each component of our framework, we performed further analysis on 25% of the entire test set. This analysis involved three distinct experimental settings. In the first experimental setting, we excluded the NER stage (Figure 3-2) and provided the ground truth entities. The second setting built upon this by adding ground truth for the time filtering and table identification (Figure 3-3,4) stages. In the third setting, we further included ground truth for pseudo table creation, self correction, and value reformatting stage (Figure 3-5,6,7). According to Table 10, our experiments with GPT-3.5 (0613) demonstrated a significant improvement in recall: 76.11% at the first setting, 82.49% at the second, and 92.83% at the third, with an approximate increase of 8 percentage points at each setting. This finding indicates that the information provided at each stage plays a crucial role in enabling the model to better understand and solve the task. Notably, the performance in the third setting exceeded 92%, showing a significant improvement over the second setting, indicating that LLMs struggle considerably with converting free text into a structured format. Refer to Appendix N for experimental results and additional analysis.

### 6 Conclusion and Future Direction

In this paper, we introduce EHRCon, a carefully crafted dataset designed to improve the accuracy and reliability of EHRs. By meticulously comparing clinical notes with their corresponding database, EHRCon addresses critical inconsistencies that can jeopardize patient safety and care quality. Alongside EHRCon, we present CheckEHR, an innovative framework that leverages LLMs to efficiently verify data consistency within EHRs. Our study lays the groundwork for future advancements in automated and dependable healthcare documentation systems, ultimately enhancing patient safety and streamlining healthcare processes.

Despite the careful design of our dataset, several limitations exist. First, although MIMIC-III is hospital data, preprocessing is required to protect patient privacy. This preprocessing can introduce inconsistencies that do not occur in the actual hospital setting. Therefore, the inconsistencies we identified may not be present in real hospital data. In this regard, future research should incorporate consistency checks using real hospital data to identify inconsistency patterns in practical settings. Secondly, despite the high quality of our dataset, created by highly trained human annotators, there are limitations in verifying the contents of all clinical notes in MIMIC-III. To cover a broader range of cases, more scalable methods will be required.

### A Datasheet for Datasets

- A.1 Motivation

- • For what purpose was the dataset created?

EHRs are integral for storing comprehensive patient medical records, combining structured data with detailed clinical notes. However, they often suffer from discrepancies due to unintuitive EHR system designs and human errors, posing serious risks to patient safety. To address this, we developed EHRCon.

- • Who created the dataset (e.g., which team, research group) and on behalf of which entity (e.g., company, institution, organization)? The authors created the dataset.
- • Who funded the creation of the dataset? If there is an associated grant, please provide the name of the grantor and the grant name and number.

This work was supported by the Institute of Information & Communications Technology Planning & Evaluation (IITP) grant (No.RS-2019-II190075), National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant (NRF-2020H1D3A2A03100945), and the Korea Health Industry Development Institute (KHIDI) grant (No.HR21C0198, No.HI22C0452), funded by the Korea government (MSIT, MOHW).

- A.2 Composition

- • What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent (e.g., documents, photos, people, countries)?

EHRCon includes entities identified in the notes along with their labels. Additionally, for inconsistent entities, it identifies the specific table and column in the EHR where the inconsistencies are found.

- • How many instances are there in total (of each type, if appropriate)? It includes 4,101 entities extracted from a total of 105 clinical notes.
- • Does the dataset contain all possible instances or is it a sample (not necessarily random) of instances from a larger set?

We randomly extracted and used 105 clinical notes from MIMIC-III. The notes consist of discharge summaries, physician notes, and nursing notes.

- • What data does each instance consist of?

Entities extracted from the notes have corresponding labels, and for inconsistent entities, the specific tables and columns in the EHR where the inconsistency occurs are recorded.

- • Is there a label or target associated with each instance? Each entity has a corresponding label.
- • Is any information missing from individual instances? If so, please provide a description, explaining why this information is missing (e.g., because it was unavailable). This does not include intentionally removed information, but might include, e.g., redacted text. No.
- • Are relationships between individual instances made explicit (e.g., users’ movie ratings, social network links)? No.
- • Are there recommended data splits (e.g., training, development/validation, testing)?

We randomly divided 105 clinical notes into a test set of 83 and a validation set of 22 for the experiment.

- • Are there any errors, sources of noise, or redundancies in the dataset?

Although trained human annotators followed the labeling instructions, slight variations may exist due to individual perspectives.

- • Is the dataset self-contained, or does it link to or otherwise rely on external resources (e.g., websites, tweets, other datasets)?

- EHRCon depends on MIMIC-III which is accessible via PhysioNet11.
- • Does the dataset contain data that might be considered confidential (e.g., data that is protected by legal privilege or by doctor-patient confidentiality, data that includes the content of individuals’ non-public communications)? No.
- • Does the dataset contain data that, if viewed directly, might be offensive, insulting, threatening, or might otherwise cause anxiety? No.
- • Does the dataset relate to people? Yes.
- • Does the dataset identify any subpopulations (e.g., by age, gender)? No.
- • Does the dataset contain data that might be considered sensitive in any way (e.g., data that reveals race or ethnic origins, sexual orientations, religious beliefs, political opinions or union memberships, or locations; financial or health data; biometric or genetic data; forms of government identification, such as social security numbers; criminal history)? No.

- A.3 Collection process

- • How was the data associated with each instance acquired?

Before starting the labeling process, we designed the labeling instructions in consultation with the partitioners. Based on these instructions, trained human annotators reviewed the clinical notes and labeled the entities.

- • What mechanisms or procedures were used to collect the data (e.g., hardware apparatuses or sensors, manual human curation, software programs, software APIs)?

We used Google Search and ChatGPT4 API (Azure) to analyze the entities in clinical notes, and SQLite3 for SQL query execution.

- • If the dataset is a sample from a larger set, what was the sampling strategy (e.g., deterministic, probabilistic with specific sampling probabilities)?

When extracting notes, we randomly selected notes with at least 800 tokens to ensure they contained sufficient content.

- • Who was involved in the data collection process (e.g., students, crowd workers, contractors) and how were they compensated (e.g., how much were crowd workers paid)? The authors manually labeled the data.
- • Over what timeframe was the data collected? We created the dataset from April 2023 to April 2024.
- • Were any ethical review processes conducted (e.g., by an institutional review board)? N/A.
- • Does the dataset relate to people? Yes.
- • Did you collect the data from the individuals in question directly, or obtain it via third parties or other sources (e.g., websites)? N/A.
- • Were the individuals in question notified about the data collection? N/A.
- • Did the individuals in question consent to the collection and use of their data? N/A.

11https://physionet.org/

- • If consent was obtained, were the consenting individuals provided with a mechanism to revoke their consent in the future or for certain uses? N/A.
- • Has an analysis of the potential impact of the dataset and its use on data subjects (e.g., a data protection impact analysis) been conducted? Yes.

- A.4 Preprocessing/cleaning/labeling

- • Was any preprocessing/cleaning/labeling of the data done (e.g., discretization or bucketing, tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, SIFT feature extraction, removal of instances, processing of missing values)?

We performed preprocessing by removing pre-admission records and treatment plans from the clinical notes.

- • Was the “raw” data saved in addition to the preprocess/cleaned/labeled data (e.g., to support unanticipated future uses)? We additionally provide labels for the original notes.
- • Is the software that was used to preprocess/clean/label the data available? We performed preprocessing using Python.

- A.5 Uses

- • Has the dataset been used for any tasks already? No.
- • Is there a repository that links to any or all papers or systems that use the dataset? N/A.
- • What (other) tasks could the dataset be used for?

It can be used not only for consistency checks of EHR but also for table-based fact verification tasks.

- • Is there anything about the composition of the dataset or the way it was collected and preprocessed/cleaned/labeled that might impact future uses? N/A.
- • Are there tasks for which the dataset should not be used? N/A.

- A.6 Distribution

- • Will the dataset be distributed to third parties outside of the entity (e.g., company, institution, organization) on behalf of which the dataset was created? No.
- • How will the dataset be distributed? The dataset will be released at PhysioNet.
- • Will the dataset be distributed under a copyright or other intellectual property (IP) license, and/or under applicable terms of use (ToU)? The dataset is released under MIT License.

- • Is there an erratum? No.
- • Will the dataset be updated (e.g., to correct labeling erros, add new instances, delete instances)? The authors will update the dataset if any corrections are required.
- • If the dataset relates to people, are there applicable limits on the retention of the data associated with the instances (e.g., were the individuals in question told that their data would be retained for a fixed period of time and then deleted)? N/A
- • Will older versions of the dataset continue to be supported/hosted/maintained? We plan to upload the latest version of the dataset and will document the updates for each version separately.
- • If others want to extend/augment/build on/contribute to the dataset, is there a mechanism for them to do so? Contact the authors ({yeonsu.k, jiho.kim}@kaist.ac.kr).

### B MIMIC-III and OMOP CDM

EHRCon is built on two types of relational databases: MIMIC-III and its version in OMOP CDM. This structure allows us to incorporate various schema types and enhance generalizability. In this section, we will describe in detail the process of creating both MIMIC-III and MIMIC-OMOP.

#### B.1 Data Preparation

We created EHRCon using 105 randomly selected clinical notes and 13 tables. In this section, we will provide a detailed description of how the clinical notes and tables were selected and preprocessed.

#### B.1.1 Note Preparation

To develop a more realistic dataset that mirrors a typical hospital setting, we began by analyzing the clinical notes from MIMIC-III by category (see Figure 4). The largest portion of notes came from the “Nursing/other” category. However, much of this content, such as details of family meetings, couldn’t be verified against the table data and was therefore excluded. Radiology reports and ECG (electrocardiogram) reports were also excluded since they rely on imaging and cardiac monitoring, which are outside our scope. Therefore, our focus was on discharge summaries, nursing notes, and physician notes, as these are commonly used in hospitals and related to tabular information.

Additionally, clinical notes may contain pre-admission history and future treatment plans not found in the EHR tables. To concentrate on current admission records, we filtered out this additional information from the notes. To ensure sufficient detail, we randomly selected 105 notes with more than 800 tokens for the experiments.

#### B.1.2 Table Preparation

To enhance the utility of our dataset, we identified tables in the MIMIC-III database that contain entities from discharge summaries, physician notes, and nursing notes. To achieve this, we analyzed randomly selected 300 clinical notes, consisting of 100 discharge summaries, 100 nursing notes, and 100 physician notes. As a result, we concluded with a total of thirteen tables, including four dictionary tables, as follows: Chartevents, Labevents, Prescriptions, Inputevents_cv, Inputevents_mv, Outputevents, Microbiologyevents, Diagnoses_icd, Procedures_icd, D_items, D_icd_diagnoses, D_icd_procedures, and D_labitems. The overall table preparation process is described in Figure 5.

- B.2 OMOP CDM

- B.2.1 Matching OMOP CDM and MIMIC-III

Table 4 illustrates how each MIMIC-III table and column correspond to the respective OMOP CDM table and column.

- B.2.2 Labeling Process of MIMIC-OMOP

MIMIC-OMOP is derived from MIMIC-III, and while both are organized using different table structures (schemas), they contain the same patient information. Therefore, the labels of the entities annotated in MIMIC-III can be directly applied to MIMIC-OMOP as well.

We downloaded the MIMIC-OMOP database12, which follows the mapping guidelines specified in Section B.2.1. Upon reviewing MIMIC-OMOP, we discovered that the drug exposure start time was recorded as being later than the end time. We corrected this issue by swapping the values in the columns.

### C Labeling Instructions

#### C.1 Task Description

Identify the entities mentioned in the clinical note and write an SQLite3 query to check if the corresponding values exist in the database. If you encounter any ambiguous or corner cases during the annotation process, make a note of them and discuss them with the practitioners and other annotators.

#### C.2 Identify the Entity

Identify the entities that likely exist in the following tables: Procedures_icd, Diagnoses_icd, Microbiologyevents, Chartevents, Labevents, Prescriptions, Inputevents_mv, Inputevents_cv, and Outputevents. Detect entities that occurred exclusively between the patient’s admission and the charted time of the note.

#### C.2.1 Additional Rules (for Discharge Summary)

- • For diagnoses, extract entities from the Discharge Diagnosis list, including both the Primary Diagnosis and Secondary Diagnosis sections.
- • For procedures, extract entities from both the Major Surgical and Invasive Procedure sections. 12Database sourced from https://github.com/MIT-LCP/mimic-omop.

#### C.3 Classify the Type of the Identified Entity

- • Type 1: Entities with numerical values.

– When the value associated with the entity is numeric.

* e.g., temp - 99.9, WBC - 9.6

- • Type 2: Entities without numerical values but whose existence can be verified in the database.

– When the value associated with the entity is not numeric and it is sufficient to confirm its

existence without checking the value in the database.

* e.g., Lasix was started, WBC was tested

- • Type 3: Entities with string values.

– When the value associated with the entity is not numeric and it is necessary to check the

value in the database.

* e.g., Lasix increased, BP was stable, WBC changed from 1 to 5, temp > 100

#### C.4 Search Items in the Database

Use the Item Search Tool to find items in the database related to the detected entity. From these, select those that accurately represent the detected entity.

• Guidelines for using the Item Search Tool

- – Display items related to the entity in the following order: D_labitems, D_items, Prescriptions, D_icd_procedures, D_icd_diagnoses
- – If none of the searched items can accurately represent the entity, manually search for the items in the database and add it.

#### C.5 Select Tables and Enter the Evidence Line

- • Check the tables connected to the selected items and select the tables to which the detected entity can be linked.
- • Enter the line number in the clinical notes where the entity is located.

#### C.6 Check the Number of Entities

This section is for checking how many times an entity is mentioned. For example, in the case of BP, if it is written as 120/50, it should be considered as two mentions of BP. Each instance should then be verified to ensure it is correctly recorded in the database.

#### C.7 Extract Information Related to the Entity from the Clinical Note

Extract the value, unit, time, organism, and specimen related to the entity. Refer to Figure 6 for the actual table columns corresponding to value, unit, time, organism and specimen.

- • Value: Numeric value corresponding to the entity (e.g., 184, 103.3).
- • Unit: Unit corresponding to the numeric value (e.g., mg, ml/h). If the unit is not specified, do not extract it.
- • Time of the clinical event occurrence

- – If only the date is noted, use the format YYYY-MM-DD. If only MM-DD is noted, use the year from the note’s chartdate to complete as YYYY-MM-DD.
- – In case the time is also specified, use the format YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS (24-hour format).
- – For relative time expression (e.g., HD #3), calculating the date based on the admission date. For ‘Yesterday’, calculate it based on the note’s chartdate.
- – If ‘admission’, ‘charttime’, or ‘discharge’ is noted, calculate the date based on the respective entry.

- – If there is no time noted, for discharge summaries, consider the entire hospitalization period. For nursing and physician notes, consider the period within one day before and one day after the chartdate.

- • Organism: This corresponds to a microbiology event and involves microorganism (e.g., bacteria, fungi).
- • Specimen: This corresponds to a microbiology event and involves specimen (e.g., blood, urine, tissue) from which the microbiological sample was obtained.

#### C.8 Example of Annotation

- • Physical Exam: Temperature 99.9

– Label based on whether there is a record with a value of 99.9 in the ‘Temperature’ data.

- • Oxygen saturation 98%

– Label based on whether there is a record with a value of 98 and unit of % in the ‘Oxygen

saturation’ data.

- • BP: 120/80 (90)

– Label whether ‘BP’ has the records of 120, 80, and 90.

#### C.9 Query Generation

Create an SQL query that utilizes the values extracted from the clinical note and satisfies the conditions specified in Figure 8. If an inconsistency occurs, mask the condition values, execute the query on the database, and identify the table and columns causing the inconsistency.

#### C.10 Notice

- • For blood pressure, if given in the format (num1/num2), each of num1 and num2 should be checked individually.
- • Exclude entities that are not explicitly identified (e.g., Chem 7: 140 / 4.2 / 104 / 25 / 15 / 1.0 / 90).

### D Time Expressions in Clinical Notes

- Figure 7 provides examples categorized by type of time expression. Furthermore, Figure 8 depicts the verification ranges for various table types based on these time expressions.

###### Discharge Summary

Since it is unclear when the temperature was measured, it can be noted that the time information of the event is not written. Given

[Figure 67]

### E Quality Control

To ensure the high quality of our dataset, we rely on expert researchers for annotation rather than crowd-sourced workers. The researchers have published AI healthcare-related papers and possess a thorough understanding of the MIMIC-III database and SQL syntax. After the labeling was completed, four annotators conducted cross-validation on a total of 20 notes.13 As a result, the F1 score of the entities recognized by the annotators was 0.880. Additionally, among the entities recognized by both annotators, the cases where the labels were the same accounted for 0.938. This demonstrates the consistency of our labeling process.

13Each type of note (e.g., discharge summary, physician note, nursing note) has its own unique format and style. Therefore, we manually cross-checked only 20 notes for each type, focusing on these characteristics. For the remaining notes, we corrected the data based on the key elements resolved during the cross-check to maintain consistency.

### F Error cases

We conducted an in-depth analysis of various discrepancies observed in EHRCon. To achieve this, we compared the coverage of tables where discrepancies occur in EHRCon and analyzed the error rates per column. Additionally, we examined in detail which columns have higher error occurrence rates for each note. These details can be found in Figure 9 to 12.

### G Prompt

The prompts used in CheckEHR can be found in Figure 13 to 20. To protect patient privacy, all values in the example data mentioned in the paper have been replaced with fictional values. Additionally, some sentences have been paraphrased or omitted.

In particular, table descriptions and column descriptions were utilized to effectively conduct the table identification and pseudo table creation processes. The descriptions used for this purpose, derived using MIMIC-III documentation14 and ChatGPT-4, can be found in Table 5 and Table 6.

Prompt Template for Note Segmentation

Task : Your task is to analyze a clinical note and divide it into three sections based on thematic or semantic coherence. Each section should center around a unique theme or idea, providing a cohesive view of the content.

Please follow these guidelines:

- • Thematic or Semantic Unity: Group content based on clear thematic or semantic relationships, ensuring that each section covers a distinct aspect related to the overall topic. Everything within a section should be related and contribute to a unified understanding of that theme.
- • Equal Length and Comprehensive Coverage: Strive for a balance in the length of each section, but also consider the depth and breadth of the content. The division should reflect an equitable distribution of information, without sacrificing the completeness of any thematic area. This balance is essential to ensure no single section is overwhelmingly long or short compared to the others.
- • Integrity of Sections: Pay close attention to the natural divisions within the text, such as headings or topic changes (e.g., ‘History of Present Illness’). Ensure that these content blocks are not fragmented across sections. A section should encompass complete thoughts or topics to preserve the logical flow and coherence of information.
- • Completeness of Sentences: When dividing the note, ensure each section ends with complete sentences, preventing sentences from being split across sections.
- • Output format must be [section1: (start_line_number-end_line_number), section2: (start_line_number-end_line_number), section3: (start_line_number-end_line_number)].
- • Precise Output Format and Continuous Line Coverage: The start line number in section1 should match the start number of the given text and the end line number in section3 should match the last line number of the given text. Ensure sections are contiguous; the end of one section immediately precedes the start of the next, with no gaps or overlaps.

Example 1) Clinical note: “44. On transfer, vitals were T 97.8, HR 72, BP 118/76, RR

- 45. She was alert, but denied dizziness, headache, palpitations,leg pain.
- 46. She reported mild shortness of breath, dry cough, mild nausea, lower abdominal
- 47. discomfort dry cough, mild nausea, lower abdominal discomfort, and decreased urine.

...

- 70. MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
- 71. 8. Zoloft 50 mg q.d.
- 72. 9. Nexium 20 mg b.i.d.
- 73. 10. Tylenol 500 mg q.d.” Output: [section1: 44-59, section2: 60-69, section3: 70-73]

Your task: Clinical note: “<<<<CLINICAL_NOTE>>>>”

The output format must be [section1: (start_line_number(int)-end_line_number(int)), section2: (start_line_number(int)-end_line_number(int)), section3: (start_line_number(int)end_line_number(int))], indicating the line numbers that mark the start and end of each section.

Prompt Template for Named Entity Recognition

Task : Develop a NER system to identify and categorize specific named entities in clinical texts step by step.

Guidelines: Extract entities step by step and classify entity.

- • Category 1: Entities Accompanied by Numeric Values

- – Definition: This category includes entities that are mentioned along with specific numeric values. These numbers represent measurable data such as dosages, counts, measurements, etc., providing precise quantifiable information.
- – Example: ‘The glucose level is 100 mg/dL’ or ‘Administer 200 mg of ibuprofen’. In these cases, the numeric values are explicitly stated.

- • Category 2: Entities Mentioned Without Any Numeric Values

- – Definition: Entities that are discussed in terms of their presence, occurrence, or the fact that they were administered or performed, without providing any numerical or quantitative data, fall into this category.
- – ‘The patient has been prescribed antibiotics’ or ‘An MRI scan was conducted’. Here, no specific dosage of antibiotics or quantitative results from the MRI scan are mentioned.

- • Category 3: Entities with Condition-Related Information Excluding Numeric Values

- – Definition: This category captures entities related to state, condition, or outcomes that are described through qualitative assessments or descriptions without the use of explicit numeric data. It may include references to changes in condition or stability, described not with numbers but in descriptive or qualitative terms.
- – Example: ‘Pt had a severe rise in ALT and AST’ or ‘Pulse was dropping’. Although these statements imply a change or assessment of condition, they do not provide specific numeric values. Instead, the focus is on qualitative descriptions of change or status, which may inherently rely on an understanding of baseline or previous values for context.

Example 1: Develop a NER system to identify and categorize specific named entities in clinical texts, step by step. Clinical note: “Physical Exam: Patient’s t is 99. Heart shows an irregular rhythm.

... LABORATORY DATA: On admission, WBC 11.0, hematocrit 35.0”

- Step 1) Extract entities related to medication or inputevents and classify each entity. Extract the entity written in the note without modifying it. Answer: Nothing
- Step 2) Extract entities related to vital signs and classify each entity. Extract the entity written in the note without modifying it. Answer: t - category 1 (numeric value: 99.6), heart rhythm - category 3 (qualitative assessments or descriptions: irregular)

... Your task: Develop a NER system to identify and categorize specific named entities in clinical texts step by step. Clinical Note: “<<<<CLINICAL_NOTE>>>>”

Prompt Template for Time Filtering

Task: You are provided with a Discharge summary and are required to analyze time information related to an entity mentioned within the note. Example 1) Please answer three questions that focus on {{**chloride**}}. Clinical note:

- • Admission Date: 1999-11-11
- • Date charted on the note: 1999-11-13
- • Content: “LABORATORY DATA: On admission, white count 9.3, hematocrit 32, platelet count 365000, PT 14, PTT 30, INR 1.3 sodium 139, potassium 4.8, {{**chloride**}} 102, CO2 26, BUN 51”

- [Question 1] Based on the discharge summary provided, did the measurement for {{**chloride**}} occur during the current hospitalization period? Respond with ‘Yes’ if it did, or ‘No’ if it pertains to past medical history or conditions.

- [Answer 1] Yes, because the chloride level was measured after the patient was admitted.

[Question 2] Extract and note the specific section from the discharge summary that mentions {{**chloride**}}, including any time expression associated with it. Ensure your transcription is accurate and does not infer or add details not present in the note.

- [Answer 2] Note: ‘LABORATORY DATA: On admission, ... {{**chloride**}} 102 ...’ Time: ‘admission’

[Question 3] Determine how the time of the {{**chloride**}} measurement is recorded in the note. Select the appropriate option based on the description provided:

- 1. Indeterminate Time stamp: Choose this if the note mentions the event in a vague or general timeframe without specific dates or times
- 2. Directly written in the format yyyy-mm-dd: Choose this for notes with specific dates or times in a clear, standardized format
- 3. Inferable Time stamp from Narrative: Choose this if the note uses terms like ‘admission’, ‘yesterday’, etc., from which the exact time of the event can be inferred based on context provided in the note.

- [Answer 3] Inferable Time stamp from Narrative Let’s solve three questions that focus on {{**<<<<ENTITY>>>>**}}. Clinical Note:

- • Admission Date: <<<<ADMISSION>>>>
- • Date charted on the note: <<<<CHARTTIME>>>>
- • Content: “<<<<CLINICAL_NOTE>>>>”

#### H.1 Effectiveness of Note Segmentation

Recent advancements in LLMs with extended context lengths have introduced the possibility of processing entire clinical notes without segmentation, potentially capturing more contextual information for error detection tasks. However, upon evaluating this approach on 25% of our test set, we found that models processing unsegmented notes consistently showed a significant decrease in recall compared to their segmented counterparts—as seen in Table 7, while there was a slight increase in precision for some models, the overall ability to detect errors diminished. GPT-3.5 with a 16k context window (without segmentation) achieved a recall of 48.64% and precision of 54.53%, whereas with segmentation (using the 4k context window), it achieved a higher recall of 65.45% and a precision of 50.75%. This suggests that current long-context LLMs may struggle with accurately extracting detailed information from extensive free-form clinical notes, leading to missed errors. Therefore, our note segmentation approach remains effective, as it enhances the models’ ability to detect errors by focusing on relevant sections and allows the use of models with shorter context lengths, which are more accessible and practical for deployment across different healthcare settings.

### I Process of Creating Pseudo Table

An example of the process for creating a pseudo table is described in Figure 22.

Here are the sentences extracted from the clinical note to determine

the time information of the entity:

A 78-year-old female patient with a history of HTN, type 2 DM, CHF, and CKD presented to the ED with symptoms related to a rapid drop in BP. On 2/2, the patient's BP was recorded at 120/30 upon arrival at the hospital. She complained of dizziness and fatigue. The patient was observed stably without any immediate interventions. On 2/4, the patient's BP dropped to 110/50 mmHg.She continued to experience dizziness and began to develop mild SOB.

[Figure 75]

"On 2/2, the patient’s BP was recorded at 120/30 upon arrival at the hospital." "On 2/4, the patient’s BP dropped to 110/50 mmHg."

[Figure 76]

Determine time information

These sentences provide the timeline and blood pressure readings for the patient during her stay.

- Figure 22: The overall process of creating a pseudo table. First, the LLM identifies sentences about a given entity (BP) in the text. Then, it finds time information in those sentences and uses this information to complete the pseudo table.

### J Hallucination of LLMs

Examples of hallucination in LLMs are described in Figure 23.

### K Experiments using Original Notes

The results using the unfiltered original notes are reported in Table 8. Clinical notes often contain not only information related to the current hospitalization but also past medical history or future plans, which can be difficult to discern from tables. To effectively filter this information, we use a Time Filtering step where an LLM determines if the entity occurred during the current hospitalization. We proceed with further steps (e.g., pseudo table creation) only if the LLM determines that the entity is relevant to the current hospitalization. The experimental results showed that Recall and Precision decreased by approximately 12.73% and 8.31%, respectively, compared to the filtered notes. This indicates that the current LLMs lack the reasoning ability to understand clinical notes and determine whether each event occurred during the current admission.

L Experiments Setting Details

- L.1 Examples of Evaluation Metrics

We measured the performance of the framework using the following three metrics: Recall, Precision, and Intersection. We demonstrate how these metrics are calculated with the following examples. Consider the gold entity set G = {{e1,i},{e2,c},{e3,c}}, and the recognized entity set R = {{e1,i},{e3,i},{e4,c}}, where en represents an entity, i indicates INCONSISTENT, and c indicates CONSISTENT. In this situation, the Recall is 33.33% because only 1 out of the 3 labeled entities, {e1,i}, was correctly classified. Similarly, the Precision is 33.33% since only 1 out of the 3 recognized entities, {e1,i}, was accurate. However, the Intersection is 50.00% because the intersection of the gold and recognized sets includes 2 entities, {e1,i} and {e3,i}, and only 1 of these, {e1,i}, was correctly classified.

- L.2 Number of In-Context Examples

We carefully designed in-context examples for each stage to maximize the performance of the framework. We provided 15 examples for Table Identification stage and 2 examples for all other stages.

### N Component Analysis of CheckEHR

All main experiments utilized the Item Search Tool (see Sec. 3.2) to search for items related to entities in the database. However, the actual annotated data also includes instances where annotators manually searched for items in the database when the search tool did not yield results. As seen in Table 11, the experiment showed that using both the outputs from the Item Search Tool and the additional manual annotations by annotators resulted in an increase in Recall and Precision by 1.75% and 4.85%, respectively, compared to using only the Item Search Tool. Therefore, future work should explore methods to find semantically similar items in the database, rather than relying solely on the surface form of the entity.

- Table 10 shows the results of experiments for component analysis conducted by matching entities with items in the database, including items added by the Item Search Tool and annotators. The open-source models also demonstrated an average performance improvement of 10% in each setting, proving that each stage plays a crucial role in solving this task. Unlike other models that showed significant performance improvements in the second and third settings, Llama3’s Recall remained at 74.96% in the third setting. This indicates that Llama3’s SQL query generation capability is inferior to that of other models. By understanding the performance of each LLM in different settings and addressing their shortcomings, the framework’s performance will be significantly enhanced.

- Figure 24: These are sample datas of EHRCon. The ‘Tmax’ example illustrates an inconsistent case, while the ‘aspirin’ example demonstrates a consistent case. The ‘tag’ provides the results of the verification, the ‘errors’ indicate the number of errors, and the ‘position’ refers to the sentence number containing each entity. The ‘entity_type’ of ‘1’ indicates that a numeric value is clearly shown, while the ‘entity_type’ of ‘2’ means that the presence of the entity in the database is sufficient for verification. If the ‘time’ is marked as ‘NaN’, it means there is no time information associated with the entity. In the provided samples, all entities and values have been altered to prevent patient identification, and the sentences within the clinical notes have been rephrased with some content added or removed.

### P SQL Generation Method

In our data annotation process, we adopted a template-based method for generating SQL queries to ensure both consistency and precision. Annotators filled in predefined SQL templates, with specific slots for table names, column names, patient identifiers, time expressions, and condition values (e.g., SELECT * FROM {table1} JOIN {table2} ON {table1}.{column_name1} = {table2}.{column_name2} WHERE {table1}.hadm_id = {hadm_id} AND [time_value_template] AND {table1}.[condition_value_column] = {condition_value}).

To cover a range of time expressions found in clinical notes, the [time_value_template] accommodated not only standard formats such as ‘YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS’ but also narrative descriptors like ‘admission’ or ‘discharge’. It even handled cases where time information was entirely absent, allowing for flexibility in the SQL query generation process. As a result, 27 unique templates were developed, all recorded in Table 12, and carefully reviewed and validated by two authors. This validation process included simulating potential queries and cross-checking the results against the underlying database to ensure the templates accurately captured the intended data retrieval logic.

Annotators relied on these validated templates to generate SQL queries throughout the annotation task, which significantly contributed to maintaining high reliability in data extraction. This approach’s effectiveness was further supported by a high inter-annotator agreement rate of 93.8%, as seen in cross-checked annotations (refer to Appendix E). This consistency in the annotations indirectly validated the accuracy of the generated SQL queries, reinforcing the robustness of our approach.
