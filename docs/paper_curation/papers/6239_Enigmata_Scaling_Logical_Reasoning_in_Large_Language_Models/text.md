## Abstract

Large Language Models (LLMs), such as OpenAI’s o1 and DeepSeek’s R1, excel at advanced reasoning tasks like math and coding via Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), but still struggle with puzzles solvable by humans without domain knowledge. We introduce Enigmata, the first comprehensive suite tailored for improving LLMs with puzzle reasoning skills. It includes 36 tasks across seven categories, each with 1) a generator that produces unlimited examples with controllable difficulty and 2) a rule-based verifier for automatic evaluation. This generator-verifier design supports scalable, multi-task RL training, fine-grained analysis, and seamless RLVR integration. We further propose Enigmata-Eval, a rigorous benchmark, and develop optimized multi-task RLVR strategies. Our trained model, Qwen2.5-32B-Enigmata, consistently surpasses o3-mini-high and o1 on the puzzle reasoning benchmarks like EnigmataEval, ARC-AGI (32.8%), and ARC-AGI 2 (0.6%). It also generalizes well to out-of-domain puzzle benchmarks and mathematical reasoning, with little multi-tasking trade-off. When trained on larger models like Seed1.5-Thinking (20B activated parameters and 200B total parameters), puzzle data from Enigmata further boosts SoTA performance on advanced math and STEM reasoning tasks such as AIME (2024-2025), BeyondAIME and GPQA (Diamond), showing nice generalization benefits of Enigmata. This work offers a unified, controllable framework for advancing logical reasoning in LLMs.

## 1 Introduction

Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) such as o1 and R1, trained from Large Language Models (LLMs) with Reinforcement Learning (RL), have demonstrated excellent performance in complex reasoning tasks [1–5], such as mathematics, STEM, and coding. The success of LRMs highlights the effectiveness of the Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) paradigm, which stresses the great importance of obtaining highquality verifiable prompts [6–8]. However, existing LRMs still struggle to complete various puzzle tasks that require purely logical reasoning skills rather than professional knowledge, which are easy and even obvious for human [9–12]. Most existing works targeting puzzles mainly focus on designing benchmarks for evaluation [10, 12, 13], lacking the training methods and resources for modern LLMs to tackle this challenge. Existing puzzle datasets often lack diversity and scalability, covering limited puzzle types and offering little

- Figure 1 Overview of the Enigmata dataset: 36 puzzle tasks across seven categories, designed to enhance and evaluate diverse reasoning capabilities in large language models.

control over generation or difficulty [10–12]. Few works target solving puzzles, yet with either designing a prompting workflow and relying on a code interpreter [14], or training LLMs upon one or a few puzzles [15, 16], which is difficult to generalize.

Based on the success of the “LLM+RLVR” paradigm, it has become crucial to obtain a large, diverse, and challenging set of verifiable puzzle prompts for training agents to master logical reasoning. To meet this need, we introduce Enigmata —a comprehensive suite that pairs a scalable, controllable puzzle dataset with a training recipe that equips LLMs with strong puzzle-solving abilities. Enigmata delivers fully synthesizable data across multiple categories, difficulty levels, and scales with automatic evaluation, thus offering effortless integration into RL pipelines.

The whole Enigmata suite comprises of Enigmata-Data, Enigmata-Eval, and Enigmata-Model. First, Enigmata-Data comprises 36 task types spanning seven broad categories, each probing a distinct facet of logical reasoning. Every task is backed by an automated generator–verifier pair: the generator can vary both the quantity and the difficulty of the puzzles it produces, while the verifier instantly checks the correctness. This design yields three key benefits: 1) It can generate unlimited self-verifying puzzle prompts, which plug seamlessly into the RLVR framework and support long chain-of-thought training. 2) Programmatic difficulty control allows researchers to mix puzzles in desired difficulty ratios and to conduct fine-grained experiments on how curriculum design influences reinforcement learning. 3) Generators can emit arbitrary sample counts per task, enabling task balancing and cross-task generalization studies.

Based on Enigmata-Data, we present the Enigmata-Eval benchmark, a diverse collection of puzzles that challenges even state-of-the-art LRMs such as o4-mini-high, providing a comprehensive assessment of logical reasoning capabilities. We introduce the Enigmata-Model recipe, a systematic approach for training highperformance LLMs on puzzle tasks. This recipe incorporates extensive research on multi-task training strategies, examining various training paradigms and data mixing techniques for controlling data amount and difficulty. Built upon Qwen2.5-32B [17], our resulting models surpass current state-of-the-art LRMs on both the Enigmata-Eval benchmark and the challenging ARC-AGI benchmark, while exhibiting remarkable improvements on out-of-domain (OOD) puzzle tasks and maintaining robust generalization in mathematical reasoning. When scaling the base model from Qwen2.5 (32B dense model) to Seed1.5-Thinking [5] (20B/200B

Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) model), we observe a nice generalization from knowledge-orthogonal puzzle data from Enigmata to tasks that require advanced math and STEM domain knowledge and reasoning skills. Such improvement over a SoTA model seems like a nice “free lunch”, since the puzzle data are mostly synthetic.

Overall, our key contributions are:

- • We introduce Enigmata, the first suite for enabling LLMs with advanced and comprehensive logical reasoning abilities for solving puzzles.
- • The Enigmata suite consists of Enigmata-Data, featuring 36 distinct tasks across 7 categories with controllable difficulty, scalable generation, and automatic verification, which seamlessly fit the RLVR training paradigm.
- • We establish Enigmata-Eval, a benchmark that rigorously and comprehensively evaluates puzzle reasoning abilities, and propose the Enigmata-Model recipe that trains models with superior performance on in-domain and OOD puzzle reasoning tasks.

## 2 Related Work

Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards. Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a key method for improving models’ reasoning capabilities. Unlike Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF), Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) removes the need for a reward model by directly assigning rewards based on objectively verifiable answers [2, 5, 18], which has shown strong performance in mathematics [19–21], STEM [2, 22], and coding [5, 18]. For example, mathematical models are rewarded when their answers match standard solutions [20, 22], while coding models receive rewards when their code passes unit tests [23]. This method is appealing due to its automation and resistance to reward hacking. Puzzles are particularly well-suited for RLVR. They can be generated automatically without expert annotations [7, 8, 15], follow clear rules with algorithmically verifiable solutions [11], and support precise control over difficulty [10, 15]. However, most prior RLVR research has focused on other domains, overlooking puzzles’ potential for delivering effective reward signals.

Puzzle Reasoning of LLMs. Unlike knowledge-intensive tasks, puzzles test a model’s reasoning abilities rather than its knowledge or memory capacity [9, 11, 12, 24]. Researchers have proposed various benchmarks to assess different types of reasoning, including abstract [9, 12], deductive [10], and compositional reasoning [13]. Some benchmarks support scalable generation and difficulty control but lack puzzle diversity [10, 12], while others offer diverse formats without controllable difficulty [11]. A comprehensive benchmark that balances diversity, scalability, and controllability is still missing. Efforts to improve LLMs’ puzzle-solving abilities mainly fall into two categories: tool integration and RLVR. Tool-based methods [14] incorporate external resources such as code or symbolic solvers but do not directly enhance the model’s internal reasoning. Recent RLVR approaches leverage the scalable generation and verification properties of puzzles [15, 16], but often focus on a single task type, such as countdown [16] or zebra logic [15], limiting generalization. Our work addresses these gaps by introducing diverse, controllable puzzle datasets and systematically analyzing factors that affect puzzle reasoning performance, including data mixing strategies and multi-task balancing.

## 3 Enigmata-Data: The Puzzle Dataset

In this section, we introduce Enigmata-Data, a comprehensive dataset designed to enhance and evaluate the complex reasoning capabilities of LLMs in RLVR training.

- 3.1 Puzzle Categories As shown in Figure 1, the Enigmata-Data is composed of 36 puzzle tasks of 7 primary categories, including:

- • Crypto Puzzle is designed to evaluate models’ understanding of cryptography and pattern recognition. Tasks such as Crypto KPA and Crypto KKA require models to decode encrypted messages or solve cryptographic challenges, testing their ability to work with hidden or encoded information.

- • Arithmetic Puzzle challenges models to solve problems that require numerical reasoning and basic arithmetic operations. Puzzles like Game24 and Countdown test a model’s ability to perform arithmetic calculations under constraints.
- • Logic Puzzle assesses deductive reasoning and the ability to infer conclusions based on premises. Puzzles like Knights and Knaves and Zebra Logic test a model’s logical thinking through challenging scenarios that require applying logical rules to solve problems.
- • Grid Puzzle includes tasks that challenge models to solve problems involving structured grids. Puzzles in this category, such as Sudoku and Star Battle, require models to reason about numbers, patterns, and placements in a grid format, testing logical and spatial reasoning abilities.
- • Graph Puzzle involves tasks where models must reason about nodes, edges, and paths within graph structures. Challenges such as Hamiltonian Path and NL Navigation test a model’s ability to understand and traverse graphs, evaluating its capacity for path-finding and network navigation.
- • Search Puzzle includes tasks that require models to explore a state space efficiently to find a correct solution under specific rules and constraints. Puzzles in this category, such as Minesweeper and Tic Tac Toe, challenge models to simulate or search through potential action sequences, evaluate game or puzzle states, and make optimal decisions. These tasks emphasize planning, local and global search, and reasoning under uncertainty.
- • Sequential Puzzle focuses on tasks that involve understanding and predicting sequences of steps. Examples include Eight Puzzle and Fifteen Puzzle, which test models’ abilities to manipulate objects in a sequence or follow a series of logical steps to reach a solution.

### 3.2 Data Construction

We outline our three-phase data construction pipeline for Enigmata-Data: (1) Tasks Collection and Design; (2) Auto-Generator and Verifier Development; (3) Sliding Difficulty Control.

Table 1 Task statistics in Enigmata-Data.

Data Type Task Number

- Phase I: Tasks Collection and Design. First, we curate and design 36 logic puzzle tasks that demand complex reasoning capabilities. Among these, 30 tasks are scalable with custom generators for creating additional puzzle instances, while the remaining 6 tasks draw puzzle instances from existing datasets. Most tasks feature multi-step reasoning that integrates various complex reasoning skills. For example, "Twiddle" simultaneously tests spatial manipulation and combinatorial planning abilities.
- Phase II: Auto-Generator and Verifier Development. Second, we equip 30 tasks in Enigmata with custom puzzle instance auto-generators, which enable automatic data scaling to generate training and evaluation data tailored to o1-like complex reasoning research. In addition, all 36 puzzle tasks have corresponding auto-verifiers that undergo manual validation. They evaluate the correctness of models’ outputs or provide outcome rewards and penalty scores for complete reasoning chains.
- Phase III: Sliding Difficulty Control. For each puzzle task, we identify key variables that control difficulty, such as grid size and blank cell count in Binario. These variables serve as parameters in our auto-generator to create puzzle instances across difficulty levels. We evaluate model performance on these puzzles using the

### 3.3 Task Statistics

Table 2 presents a comparison between Enigmata and existing puzzle resources. Enigmata is the only dataset encompassing multiple task categories, offers scalability, provides automatic verification, and is publicly available. Additionally, it uniquely employs the RLVR approach to enhance models’ puzzle reasoning capabilities fundamentally. Table 1 presents the distribution of tasks across the Enigmata dataset.

### 3.4 Enigmata-Eval

We develop Enigmata-Eval by systematically sampling from our broader dataset. For each task, we aimed to extract 50 instances per difficulty level (Easy, Medium, Hard). However, due to inherent constraints in some tasks, we collected 4,758 puzzle instances rather than the theoretical maximum of 5,400. This discrepancy arises because some tasks generate fewer than 50 instances per difficulty level, while others rely on manually collected and annotated data rather than auto-generation. Importantly, we ensured no data leakage between training and evaluation sets by implementing strict separation protocols during the sampling process.

## 4 Enigmata-Model: The Training Recipe

Developing advanced logical reasoning in language models requires a carefully structured training approach that develops diverse reasoning skills while avoiding overfitting specific problem types. Our training methodology follows a two-stage process designed to build reasoning abilities systematically: (1) rejection fine-tuning to establish foundational reasoning patterns and (2) multi-task RL to develop general reasoning skills that transfer across diverse problem domains.

### 4.1 Rejection Fine-tuning

Directly applying reinforcement learning to a base model often results in training instability and may not unlock the model’s full performance potential [2]. To address this, we begin with rejection fine-tuning (RFT), i.e., leveraging high-quality solutions during supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to establish solid foundational reasoning patterns. In our training data, we strategically combine math problems with puzzles, as mathematics elicits diverse reasoning patterns and contributes to the model generalization [26].

For puzzles, we uniformly sample tasks and difficulty levels from the Enigmata dataset to ensure a comprehensive coverage and balanced distribution of reasoning patterns. We also include the training data of the ARC-AGI puzzle [9, 27] in the RFT data, since it is too difficult to learn without RFT as cold-start. For each puzzle instance, we utilize DeepSeek-R1 [2] to generate 8 candidate solutions, from which we select the correct solution for RFT. The mathematical component consists of carefully curated examples from a high-quality R1-distilled mathematical dataset [28]. Throughout RFT, we maintain a balanced 1:1 ratio between puzzles and mathematical problems to ensure comprehensive reasoning development across domains. Detailed implementation and dataset specifications are provided in Appendices B and C.

### 4.2 RL with Verifiable Puzzles

We use VC-PPO [29], a PPO variant [30], to train our models. Each of the 36 tasks in Enigmata has an automated verifier vi that instantly scores a response as correct or incorrect. For 30 tasks we also have a generator gi that can create examples at any difficulty; the other 6 tasks draw from fixed pools Fi. For each task i and difficulty level d ∈ Di, we choose how many examples Ni,d to use. Then:

 

gi Ni,d,d , i ≤ 30,

d∈Di

si =

Sample Fid,min(Ni,d,|Fid|) , i > 30.



d∈Di

The full training set is S = i si, with total size |S| = i |si|. By changing the Ni,d, we can easily adjust: 1) How many examples come from each task, 2) The mix of easy vs. hard items, 3) Overall dataset size. During

training, each generated example is fed to its verifier vi, which returns a reward that VC-PPO uses to update the policy. This loop provides a fully automatic RL pipeline for puzzle reasoning.

### 4.3 Multi-task Training

Developing general logical reasoning is hard because different puzzles require different thinking skills. To build strong, transferable problem-solving abilities, we explore two multi-task training methods: Mix-training RL and Multi-stage RL, since single-task training often leads to narrow expertise and poor transfer to new puzzles [15].

A rich diversity of tasks can significantly enhance generalization and actively prevent overspecialization [2]. Therefore, we employ Mix-training RL to integrate multiple puzzle types simultaneously during the training process. Our methodology involves a meticulously constructed dataset that integrates three critical components: a) The training split of Enigmata, featuring balanced task and difficulty distributions; b) The public training set of ARC-AGI 1 and 2, which improve the generalization of existing reasoning abilities to unseen tasks; and c) AIME mathematical problems (1983-2023), which are difficult enough to elicit diverse reasoning patterns and enhance generalization. A strategic 1:1 puzzle-to-mathematics ratio is maintained throughout this training process to foster the development of complementary reasoning systems within the model.

Mix-training RL offers broad exposure to different puzzle types, but the varied reasoning skills required can cause conflicts between tasks. To address this, we adopt Multi-stage RL, a curriculum-based approach that builds core skills before introducing new challenges. For difficult tasks like ARC-AGI, we use a two-phase strategy: 1) train intensively on ARC-AGI 1, 2, and AIME until the model generalizes well and performance stabilizes; 2) gradually introduce Enigmata-Data while retaining earlier data to avoid forgetting. This stepby-step method helps the model learn complex reasoning more effectively and maintain strong performance on earlier tasks. More implementation details are provided in Appendix B.

## 5 Experiments

### 5.1 Experiment Setup

We adopt several challenging reasoning benchmarks for evaluation: Enigmata-Eval, and abstract reasoning challenges ARC-AGI 1 [9] and ARC-AGI 2 [27] known for their extreme difficulty for LLMs. We also include the knowledge-orthogonal reasoning benchmark KOR-Bench [11], which contains puzzles from five categories. To examine generalization capabilities, we include the advanced mathematics benchmark AIME 2024. We evaluate each AIME problem 32 times and others 4 times, reporting the average performance for reliability. Baselines are described in Appendix D.

We train our models from Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct [17], a solid starting point for training strong reasoning models [2, 31]. After acquiring the RFT model (Qwen2.5-32B-RFT), we leverage the Mix-Training approach with 370 training steps to get the RL model (Qwen2.5-32B-Enigmata), showing superior overall performance in our experiments. Each PPO step performs multiple gradient updates by iterating over 4 mini-batches derived from the training batch. Details are described in Appendix C.

### 5.2 Results

According to Table 3, our model outperforms most of the public models on Enigmata-Eval with 32B parameters, demonstrating the effectiveness of our dataset and training recipe. Besides, our model stands out on the challenging ARC-AGI benchmark, surpassing strong reasoning models such as Gemini 2.5 Pro,

- o3-mini, and o1. Additionally, RFT and multi-task RL training strategies yield significant performance gains
- on OOD benchmarks. This indicates that our training recipe effectively enhances the model’s general logic reasoning abilities and can generalize to unseen tasks. Moreover, after RL training, our models maintain comparable math reasoning abilities gained from rejection fine-tuning, showing that our training strategy preserves general reasoning capabilities while enhancing logic-specific skills.

Next, let’s dive into detailed analysis across reasoning categories in Enigmata-Eval. In Table 4, Qwen2.5-32BEnigmata demonstrates exceptional performance in structured reasoning categories, particularly excelling in Crypto, Arithmetic, and Logic tasks. This suggests that our training approach effectively develops capabilities in rule-based reasoning with explicit constraints and patterns. Besides, our model shows competitive performance in search tasks, outperforming most baseline models. Search problems require strategic exploration of solution spaces and planning capabilities. The strong performance suggests that our approach effectively develops these higher-order reasoning skills. Notably, we observe a consistent performance hierarchy across categories for most models. Crypto and Arithmetic tasks tend to yield the highest accuracy, while spatial and sequential tasks remain more difficult. These challenges point to promising directions for future work.

### 5.3 Generalization with Scaling: Free Lunch from Enigmata

Can logical reasoning data, such as puzzles that do not require domain knowledge, benefit general reasoning capabilities? We do not observe such a generalization for Qwen2.5-32B. Therefore, we scale the experiments to a much larger model. We follow Seed1.5-Thinking [5] and train from the same Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model in the RL stage, which features 20B activated and 200B total parameters. To make a fair comparison between Seed1.5-Thinking, we adopt the same base model (20B/200B) and the same RL training data except for 20K Enigmata-Data, and train the models for comparable PPO steps.

Surprisingly, the results in Table 5 show that our dataset enhances general capabilities like math and STEM problem-solving. When compared to Seed1.5-Thinking, a leading reasoning model, additional training with Enigmata, i.e., Seed1.5-Thinking-Enigmata, generally improves performance on AIME 2024 and 2025, BeyondAIME [5] (an expert-curated, more challenging evaluation dataset), and GPQA Diamond [32].

the difficulty of further improving SoTA models like Seed1.5-Thinking, simply incorporating Enigmata ’s synthetic puzzle data during the RL training stage appears almost like a “free lunch” for expanding the capability spectrum of reasoning models, even leading to generalization improvements in general advanced reasoning.∗

### 5.4 Ablation Studies

Training Data Size. We study the impact of varying sizes of Enigmata-Train data on model performance during the second stage of Multi-stage Training. To ensure a fair comparison, all checkpoints were evaluated using models obtained at step 150 from the sample stage-1 checkpoint, with equal sampling across all difficulty levels. As shown in Figure 2, first, a small amount of Enigmata-Train data in the second stage significantly improves Enigmata-Eval performance while better preserving first-stage knowledge and OOD performance. Second, increasing Enigmata-Train data progressively enhances in-domain Enigmata-Eval performance. Third, excessive Enigmata-Train data leads to catastrophic forgetting and slightly degraded OOD performance.

Data Difficulty Control. We study how the distribution of data difficulty affects performance. As described in § 4.2, we set the data size at different difficulty levels as Nid. With Ni = 400 per task, we compare two ratios in Multi-stage Training’s second stage: balanced (Nieasy : Nimed : Nihard=1:1:1) versus medium-focused (Nieasy : Nimed : Nihard = 2:6:2). The latter setting quantifies how extreme samples can undermine RL training [20]. We also compare with historical reward variation (HRV) [33] as baseline data selection strategy,

∗Note that, we primarily experiment upon Qwen2.5-32B for further analysis due to the prohibitive resources required to train a 20B/200B model.

using the same stage-1 checkpoint and 150 second-stage steps. As shown in Table 6, the balanced difficulty ratio (1:1:1) enables the model to demonstrate more robust complex reasoning performance. Also, our effortless difficulty control method based on difficulty tags in Enigmata data performs comparably to HRV on Enigmata-Eval while delivering superior results on OOD benchmarks.

Multi-task Training. For the two training paradigms (Multi-stage RL and Mix-Training RL) in § 4.3, we evaluate the impact of SFT/RFT using two variants: 1) SFTPart, which excludes three tasks (Countdown, Minesweeper, Light Up) to test transfer ability; and 2) SFTAll, which includes all tasks as a complete baseline. To ensure fair comparison, all checkpoints were trained for identical total steps: (1) Multi-Stage training consisting of 200 steps in stage 1 and 225 steps in stage 2; and (2) Mix-Training using the combined dataset across all 425 steps. As shown in Table 7, first, Multi-Stage and Mix-Training approaches show complementary strengths. Multi-Stage builds deeper task-specific reasoning, while Mix-Training improves generalization. Second, With limited pre-training data, Multi-Stage transfers better to unseen tasks, especially complex ones like Enigmata and ARC-AGI, reflecting curriculum learning benefits. Third, Mix-Training generalizes better to OOD tasks, suggesting that diverse training helps models learn broader reasoning strategies beyond specific tasks.

Moreover, Figure 4 shows Mix-Training RL’s and Multi-Stage RL’s training dynamics. We observe a positive correlation between rewards and response length. Both approaches achieve similar final rewards, showing the signs of test-time scaling effect [34, 35] where models learn to explore more tokens to find better solutions. However, the more volatile response length under Multi-Stage RL suggests instability in generation. In contrast, Mix-Training RL yields more consistent outputs with smoother length curves, indicating greater training stability.

### 5.5 Analysis

How does SFT affect RL training? We further analyze the influence of SFT on RL training to explore the reason behind the performance gap in Table 4.3. We represent the reward curves across different training steps for different training approaches in Figure 3. For simple tasks like Countdown, all methods achieve similar improvements, suggesting that SFT is not essential. For medium-complexity

#### tasks like Minesweeper, Mix-Training struggles without SFT, while Multi-stage RL still learns effectively.

When the task is included in SFTAll, both approaches start from a higher baseline and quickly optimize to nearperfect accuracy. This pattern is typical for tasks with fixed solution patterns or shortcuts—once the model grasps the solving approach, performance improves dramatically. For high-complexity tasks like Light Up, the combination of comprehensive SFT and Multi-stage RL dramatically outperforms all other approaches, particularly for difficult variants of the task. Interestingly, Mix-Training RL without relevant SFT (c) fails, highlighting that complex reasoning tasks require both strong foundational knowledge (from relevant SFT) and structured learning approaches (from Multi-stage RL) to achieve optimal results.

Code Utilization in Puzzle Reasoning. We investigated whether code utilization enhances model performance on reasoning tasks. We identified code elements in model outputs using keyword detection and pattern matching and classified responses accordingly. According to Table 8, code utilization hindered puzzle task performance. This suggests that current models fail to effectively use code without executing it for complex reasoning tasks.

## 6 Conclusion

In this paper, we present Enigmata, a suite for equipping LLMs with advanced puzzle reasoning, which integrates seamlessly with reinforcement learning using verifiable rule-based rewards. Enigmata-Data features 36 tasks across seven reasoning categories, with its scalable generation, automated verification, and adjustable difficulty. We also introduce the Enigmata-Eval benchmark for assessing puzzle reasoning abilities and guiding research on generalizable reasoning models. Enigmata-Model, trained with RLVR, demonstrates its superior performance and robust generalization and reasoning skills. Experiments also demonstrate that when trained on larger models such as Seed1.5-Thinking (20B/200B), synthetic puzzle data brings extra benefits in other domains, such as math and STEM reasoning, over a SoTA model. We hope Enigmata serves as a solid foundation for the community to push forth the research on reasoning models.

## A Reward Curves Across Individual Tasks in Enigmata

We conducted a detailed analysis of our model’s learning dynamics by examining reward curves across all tasks in the Enigmata dataset. Figure 6 presents these learning trajectories, revealing several important patterns in how models acquire puzzle-solving capabilities.

The reward curves across tasks reveal three distinct learning patterns:

- 1. Gradual Mastery Tasks: Several tasks, such as Light Up and Zebra Logic show smooth and consistent reward gains throughout training. These tasks typically involve complex reasoning chains or require integrating multiple constraints, making them suitable for long-horizon learning. The steady upward trend suggests that the agent is progressively refining its decision-making strategy through extended exploration.
- 2. Difficulty-Stratified Tasks: Tasks like Car Painting, Star Battle, and Hitori demonstrate clear separation between difficulty levels: easy instances are learned relatively early, while medium and hard variants require significantly more training to improve. This stratification indicates that the difficulty scaling mechanism is practical and yields meaningful distinctions in learning complexity.
- 3. Stagnant or Low-Learning Tasks: Some tasks, including Big Bench Symbolic and Magic Square, show little to no improvement across all difficulty levels, particularly on the challenging setting. This suggests that these tasks may suffer from challenges such as sparse rewards, long-term dependencies, or overly complex solution spaces that PPO struggles to handle without additional guidance.

These learning patterns offer actionable insights for curriculum design. Tasks mastered early can serve as warm-up phases to bootstrap the agent’s core skills, while more challenging tasks can be introduced later to push reasoning boundaries. Understanding which tasks exhibit positive transfer or potential interference is key to optimizing multi-task training regimes.

## B Training Dataset Details

### B.1 Rejection Fine-tuning.

For the puzzle part of the Rejection Finetuning (RFT) dataset, we sample 1,000 instances from each task in the Enigmata dataset. We also include synthetic ARC-AGI data§. We then use DeepSeek-R1 to generate 8 candidate solutions for each instance and select one correct solution per instance. The final puzzle dataset contains 12,041 high-quality puzzle samples. For the mathematical part of the RFT dataset, we collected mathematical problems from light-R1 [28] that DeepSeek-R1 answered. We included all data from stage 2 of light-R1 and sampled 3,000 additional problems from stage 1, resulting in 12,533 mathematical samples.

### B.2 Reinforcement with Verifiable Puzzles.

For our reinforcement learning with verifiable puzzles, we implemented two training paradigms. The detailed data mixing ratio is shown in Table 9 and introduced below. As for the Mix-Training, the dataset for this approach consists of three components: (1) Enigmata-Train: 400 samples per task with equal distribution across difficulty levels. Note that we excluded eight tasks from the training set: six tasks deemed too difficult (Eight Puzzle, Fifteen Puzzle, Nine Puzzle, Sixteen Puzzle, Natural Language Navigation, Slant), one task too simple (Game24) based on pass@k evaluation, and one task lacking training data (FOLIO). (2) ARC-AGI 1 and 2: Official datasets upsampled 8x to address specific reasoning challenges, (3) AIME problems from 1983-2023 upsampled 2x as the mathematical component. As for the Multi-stage RL, this approach follows a curriculum strategy with two distinct stages: (1) Stage 1: Training on ARC-AGI 1 and 2 (upsampled 8x) along with AIME problems (upsampled 1x) (2) Stage 2: Incorporating Enigmata-Train while maintaining the datasets from Stage 1 (ARC-AGI 1, ARC-AGI 2, and AIME) without additional upsampling to prevent catastrophic forgetting

## C Implementation Details

We finetune the model on this balanced dataset for 2 epochs using a maximum sequence length of 32768 tokens and a learning rate 1e-5, establishing a strong reasoning foundation before proceeding to reinforcement learning.

We adopt a variant of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) [30], i.e., VC-PPO [29], to train our reasoning agent on verifiable puzzles. This variant introduces several modifications tailored to long-chain-of-thought generation, improving training stability and performance over long sequences.

Standard PPO optimizes the following clipped objective:

≤t∼πθold min rt(θ)Aˆt, clip(rt(θ),1 − ε,1 + ε)Aˆt , (1)

JPPO(θ) = E(q,a)∼D,o

θ(ot|q,o<t)

where rt(θ) = π

πθold(ot|q,o<t) is the importance sampling ratio, and Aˆt is the estimated advantage. We compute Aˆt using Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE) [30]:

AˆGAEt (γ,λ) =

∞

(γλ)lδt+l, where δl = Rl + γV (sl+1) − V (sl). (2)

l=0

To optimize long-CoT training, we follow the VC-PPO and adopt the following modifications to the standard PPO algorithm:

- • Removing KL Divergence Constraint. In traditional RLHF [36], a KL penalty is used to prevent the policy from diverging too far from the reference model. However, in long-CoT settings, this constraint often limits exploration and learning capacity. Following VC-PPO, we remove the KL term by setting kl_loss_weight = 0.0, allowing the model to deviate from the initial policy distribution freely.
- • Value Pretraining. We observe that initializing the value model from the reward model causes unstable training due to their objective mismatch. To address this, we adopt value pretraining: first sample

responses from a fixed SFT policy πsft, compute Monte Carlo returns, and train the value model until the loss and explained variance converge. The pretrained value model is then used to initialize the critic for PPO.

- • Decoupled GAE. We use different λ values for the policy and the value model to reduce reward decay and improve optimization over long token sequences. Specifically, we set λcritic = 1.0 for unbiased value estimation, and λpolicy = 0.95 to improve sample efficiency and learning speed.

Training Details. We set the maximum prompt length to 6,144 tokens and the maximum response length to 26,624 tokens. PPO training is conducted for 425 steps with a batch size 4,096 and a mini-batch size 512. The actor and critic are optimized using Adam, with learning rates of 1 × 10−6 and 2 × 10−6, respectively, and a linear warm-up schedule over 10 steps. Before PPO begins, we perform value pretraining [29] for 15 steps by collecting Monte Carlo returns from a fixed SFT policy and fitting the value model to these returns. Our implementation is based on the VeRL ¶ framework. We enable gradient checkpointing for both the actor and the critic to reduce memory consumption. Rollouts are generated using temperature sampling (τ = 1.0), with enforced end-of-sequence tokens. We leverage vLLM [37] for efficient batched decoding with 256 rollout slots and paged attention.

- D Baselines We categorize our baseline models into the following groups for comparison:

General-purpose LLMs. As reference benchmarks, we also included several top-tier general-purpose models:

- • GPT-4o-1120 [38]: OpenAI’s model, representing the current highest standard of general models.
- • Gemini 2.5 Pro [3]: Google’s advanced model with excellent performance across various tasks.
- • Claude 3.7 Sonnet [4]: Anthropic’s high-performance model known for its reliability and comprehensiveness.
- • Grok-2-1212 [39]: xAI’s open-weight model, demonstrating the potential of open-source models.
- • Qwen-2.5-32B-Instruct [17]: Alibaba’s moderate-scale language model with strong performance in both Chinese and English tasks, which serves as our main backbone model for training.

Reasoning-specialized LLMs. We selected the current state-of-the-art models specialized in reasoning:

- • o1 [1], o3-mini [1], and o4-mini [1]: Representing OpenAI’s advancements in reasoning capabilities, particularly excelling in solving complex problems.
- • DeepSeek-R1 [2]: A model optimized for mathematical and reasoning tasks, with outstanding performance in multi-step reasoning.
- • Claude-3.7-Sonnet-Thinking [4]: Employing a specialized chain-of-thought design to enhance capabilities in solving complex reasoning tasks.
- • DeepSeek-R1-Distilled-Qwen2.5-32B [2]: Transferring DeepSeek-R1’s reasoning capabilities to a smaller model through knowledge distillation.
- • QwQ-32B [31]: Alibaba’s reasoning model trained from Qwen-2.5-32B.

This categorized comparison allows us to comprehensively evaluate our model’s performance in both specialized reasoning capabilities and general abilities, while comparing against different types of state-of-the-art models. For evaluation, we use temperature sampling (τ = 1.0).

## Limitations

Due to the limited time and resources, we did not train on other backbone models with Enigmata-Data, or with RL algorithms other than VC-PPO. However, we believe the results from our experiments can be generalized to other back models and algorithms. Additionally, our data is all in single-turn textual form, and we did not include multi-turn puzzles or visual puzzles into Enigmata we leave for future research. Due to the research purpose of this work, we only train LLMs with hundreds of competitive math problems along with Enigmata-Data. In practice, our training resources could easily be included in an already comprehensive training set while maintaining (if not surpassing) the original performance of tasks in the original dataset.

Training Steps

###### Figure 6 Reward curves for Qwen2.5-32B-Enigmata across all individual tasks during training. Each subplot represents a different puzzle task, with the x-axis showing training steps and the y-axis showing average reward. Colors indicate different difficulty levels: Easy (green), Medium (blue), and Hard (red).

## E Enigmata Details

This section details the Enigmata dataset, including task specifications, difficulty estimation methodology, and example cases.

### E.1 Task Details

We present the detailed specifications of all tasks in Enigmata in Tables 10, 11, and 12. These tables provide comprehensive information about each task, including: (1) Task category: Enigmata encompasses seven distinct reasoning categories. (2) Data source: Whether the task is automatically generated or sourced from existing datasets. (3) Difficulty control variables: The specific parameters used to adjust task difficulty. (4) Rule descriptions: Concise explanations of each puzzle type’s rules. These details illustrate the diversity and controllability of the Enigmata dataset, highlighting how each task contributes to different aspects of reasoning assessment.

### E.2 Difficulty Estimation

In Section § 3.2, we introduce our method for difficulty control in Enigmata: determining different difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard) for puzzles through model pass@k metrics. Specifically, we use GPT-4o’s pass@k (k=1,10,100) to establish these difficulty tiers. Table 13 showcases specific examples of puzzles at different difficulty levels. As demonstrated, there are clear distinctions in model pass@k performance between easy, medium, and hard levels across various tasks.

Listing 4 Case of Skyscraper

Skycraper is a logic puzzle game where the goal is to fill a grid matrix based on the given clues. Here

are the basic rules: Rules:

- 1. Game Board: It typically consists of an n x n grid matrix. Each cell represents a building , and the building height is represented by a number ranging from 1 to n, where n is the size of the matrix.

- 2. Building Heights: Each row and column must be filled with numbers that represent building heights. Each number can only appear once in a row or column , similar to Sudoku constraints.

- 3. Visibility Clues: The hint numbers outside the matrix indicate how many buildings can be seen from that direction. Taller buildings block the view of shorter buildings behind them. Thus , a hint number represents how many buildings are visible from one end of a row or column. For example , if the clue for a column is "3", it means that from the top or bottom of that column , 3 buildings can be seen , and the building heights must increase , as shorter buildings will be blocked by taller ones.

- 4. Objective: Fill the entire matrix based on the clues , ensuring that the heights of the buildings are distinct in each row and column and follow the visibility clues at the edges.

Example: [2] [1] [2] [3]

+---+---+---+---+

- [2] | | | | | [2]

+---+---+---+---+

- [3] | | | | | [2]

+---+---+---+---+

[1] | | | | | [2] +---+---+---+---+ +---+---+---+---+ [2] [3] [2] [1]

- [4] | | | | | [1]

This is an example of a Skycraper puzzle:

- - The numbers at the top and bottom of the columns indicate how many buildings can be seen from that direction. For instance , the clue at the top of the first column is "2", meaning that 2 buildings can be seen from the top , indicating that at least one building is hidden by a taller one.

- - The left and right clues for the rows work similarly , indicating how many buildings are visible from that row ’s left or right side.

Task: Now , given a Skycraper puzzle , your task is to reconstruct the height of the buildings in each cell. If

there are multiple solutions , return any one. If no valid solution exists , state that no solution exists. Output Format:

- Please output your answer within a code block (‘‘‘), formatted as a grid of numbers , for example: ‘‘‘

- 2 4 3 1

- 3 1 2 4

- 4 3 1 2

- 1 2 4 3 ‘‘‘

Puzzle: The input clues are: Top: 3 2 2 1 Left: 4 2 3 1 Right: 1 2 2 2 Bottom: 1 3 2 2

Listing 5 Case of Sum Skyscraper

Sum Skycraper is a logic puzzle game where the goal is to fill a grid matrix based on given clues and the height and number restrictions of rows and columns. Here are the basic rules:

Rules:

- 1. Game Board: Typically , it is an n x n grid matrix. Each cell represents a building , with its height represented by a number ranging from 1 to n, where n is the length of the matrix side.

- 2. Building Heights: Each row and column must be filled with numbers representing the heights of the buildings. Each number can only appear once in a row or column , similar to Sudoku constraints.

- 3. Visibility Clues: The hint numbers outside the matrix tell you how many buildings can be seen from that direction. Taller buildings will block shorter buildings behind them. Therefore , a hint number indicates the total height of buildings visible from one end of the row or column.

For example , if a column ’s hint is "11," it means that looking from the top or bottom of that column , the total height of the visible buildings is 11. Additionally , the building heights need to be in increasing order , meaning shorter buildings are blocked by taller ones in front.

- 4. Objective: Fill the entire matrix according to the clues , ensuring that the heights of buildings in each row and each column are different , and that they comply with the visibility clues on the sides. Example:

[7] [4] [5] [9]

+---+---+---+---+ [7] | | | | | [6] +---+---+---+---+

- [9] | | | | | [5]

+---+---+---+---+ [4] | | | | | [7] +---+---+---+---+

- [10]| | | | | [4]

+---+---+---+---+ [5] [9] [7] [4]

The above is an example of a Sum Skycraper:

- - The numbers at the top and bottom of the columns indicate how many buildings can be seen from that direction. For example , the hint at the top of the first column is "7," meaning that the total height of the visible buildings from top to bottom is 7.

- - The hints on the left and right of the rows are similar to those for the columns , indicating the total height of buildings visible from the left and right sides of that row. For example , if the hint is 10, it means the visible buildings could possibly be 1, 2, 3, 4.

Task: Now , given a Sum Skycraper scenario , please restore the height of each building in the scenario. If there are multiple answers , output any one of them. If there is no valid solution , then respond with " no valid solution."

- - The input data consists of four lines: the first line represents the height seen from top to bottom , the second line from left to right , the third line from right to left , and the fourth line from bottom to top.

- - Using the previous example , the input data would be: ‘‘‘ 7 4 5 9 7 9 4 10

- 6 5 7 4

- 5 9 7 4 ‘‘‘

- - Please output your answer within a code block (‘‘‘), formatted as a grid of numbers storing the heights of the buildings , for example: ‘‘‘ 2 4 3 1 3 1 2 4 4 3 1 2

- 1 2 4 3 ‘‘‘

- - If no solution exists , the result should be: "No valid solution." Puzzle: ‘‘‘

- 7 9 4 5

- 7 9 4 5

- 5 4 7 9

- 5 4 7 9 ‘‘‘ Please provide the answer according to the above requirements.

Listing 6 Case of Star Battle

You are tasked with solving a customized version of the star -battle puzzle. The star -battle puzzle is a

logic puzzle that requires the placement of stars in a grid. There is only one solution to this puzzle. Your goal is to determine the location of each star , adhering to the following rules:

Rules:

- 1. NOTATIONS:

- - The initial board consists of empty cells and blocked cells.

- - Empty cells are denoted by ’.’, blocked cells are denoted by ’X’, and stars are denoted by ’*’.

- 2. STAR MUST BE PLACED IN EMPTY CELL:

- - Each star must be placed in an EMPTY cell.

- - Blocked cells cannot contain stars.

- - You can only change cells denoted by ’.’, and must not change cells denoted by ’X’.

- 3. EXACTLY 1 STAR IN EACH ROW AND COLUMN:

- - Each row and column must contain EXACTLY one star.

- - No two stars can be in the same row or column.

- - There shouldn ’t be rows or columns without stars.

- 4. NO ADJACENT STARS ROW -WISE , COLUMN -WISE , OR DIAGONALLY: No two stars can be adjacent to each other , even diagonally.

- - Row -wise adjacency: two stars are in the same row , and there is no empty cell between them.

- - Column -wise adjacency: two stars are in the same column , and there is no empty cell between them.

- - Diagonal adjacency: two stars are in the same diagonal , and there is no empty cell between them. Note that you are prone to make mistakes in diagonal adjacency , so be extra careful. Here are 2 examples of diagonal adjacency in a partial grid: ‘‘‘

. * . . . . * . ‘‘‘ ‘‘‘

. . * . . * . . ‘‘‘ In both cases , the two stars are diagonally adjacent. You should avoid this situation.

- 5. CHECK FOR CONSTRAINTS AND BACKTRACK:

- - In each step , you should check if it violates the constraints in 2., 3., and 4.

- - If you find inconsistencies , you should backtrack and try a different placement.

- - If you find that you can ’t place a star anywhere without violating the constraints , you should backtrack and try a different placement.

- - Since there is only one solution , there is great chance your first placement is incorrect , which means you might need to start over.

Task: Determin the location of each star and place them into the grid , adhering to the rules.

- - Your output should include the final board.

- - The final board is a revised version of the initial board in a way that if you need to place a star in an empty cell , replace the ’.’ with a ’*’.

- - Don ’t change the blocked cells denoted by ’X’.

- - Your final board should be wrapped between <begin_board > and <end_board > tags.

- - Use the following structure:

Final Board: ‘‘‘ <begin_board > [Final Board] <end_board > ‘‘‘

Puzzle: The input clues are: ‘‘‘

. . . X . . . X . . . . X . . . . . X . . . X . X ‘‘‘ Please provide the answer according to the above requirements.

Listing 15 Case of Stack Permutation

Stack permutation is a permutation problem related to stacks (a last -in, first -out data structure). Given an input sequence , the goal is to generate different output sequences using stack operations ( push and pop). A sequence is called a valid stack permutation if it can be obtained through stack operations.

Task and Rules: Given a sequence of natural numbers , such as [1, 2, 3, 4], we want to know if a particular output sequence can be obtained through stack operations. The stack operations include:

- 1. Push: Add numbers from the input sequence to the stack in order.

- 2. Pop: Remove elements from the top of the stack and add them to the output sequence. Example: Suppose the input sequence is [1, 2, 3]. Here are some possible valid stack permutations:

- - [1, 2, 3]: Directly push all elements into the stack and then pop them in order.

- - [2, 1, 3]: Push 1 and 2 into the stack , pop 2, then pop 1, and finally push and pop 3.

- - [3, 2, 1]: Push all elements into the stack , then pop them in reverse order. Output Format:

- - Please output your answer within a code block (‘‘‘), for ‘‘‘ ["Push(1)", "Pop()", "Push(2)", "Push(3)", "Pop()", "Pop()"] ‘‘‘
