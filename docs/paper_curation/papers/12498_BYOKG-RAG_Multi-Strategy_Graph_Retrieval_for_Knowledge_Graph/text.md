### Abstract

Knowledge graph question answering (KGQA) presents significant challenges due to the structural and semantic variations across input graphs. Existing works rely on Large Language Model (LLM) agents for graph traversal and retrieval; an approach that is sensitive to traversal initialization, as it is prone to entity linking errors and may not generalize well to custom (“bring-your-own”) KGs. We introduce BYOKG-RAG, a framework that enhances KGQA by synergistically combining LLMs with specialized graph retrieval tools. In BYOKG-RAG, LLMs generate critical graph artifacts (question entities, candidate answers, reasoning paths, and OpenCypher queries), and graph tools link these artifacts to the KG and retrieve relevant graph context. The retrieved context enables the LLM to iteratively refine its graph linking and retrieval, before final answer generation. By retrieving context from different graph tools, BYOKGRAG offers a more general and robust solution for QA over custom KGs. Through experiments on five benchmarks spanning diverse KG types, we demonstrate that BYOKG-RAG outperforms the second-best graph retrieval method by 4.5% points while showing better generalization to custom KGs. BYOKGRAG framework is open-sourced at https:// github.com/awslabs/graphrag-toolkit.

### 1 Introduction

Knowledge Graphs (KGs) (Vrandeˇci´c and Krötzsch, 2014) are databases that store information and data in structured format, typically using entities and relationships. The structure of KGs enables efficient data updates and complex queries, making them valuable assets for enterprises across multiple sectors (Ozsoy et al., 2024). In the Large Language Model (LLM) era (Brown et al., 2020; Bommasani et al., 2021), KGs have been widely adapted as external information sources to ground

Figure 1: While agentic retrieval (top) may be prone to linking and retrieval errors, e.g., for aggregation queries, BYOKG-RAG (middle) employs multi-strategy linking and retrieval, along with iterative refinement, to mitigate these errors. As a result, BYOKG-RAG improves KGQA performance across diverse KGs (bottom).

LLM responses to semantics present in the graph and to solve KG Question Answering (KGQA) tasks (Pan et al., 2024). In KGQA, one prevalent approach is retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) that leverages graph retrieval methods to fetch relevant information from the KG as additional input for the LLM (Lewis et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2024).

Adapting RAG to custom (“bring-your-own”) KGs presents significant challenges as KGs vary not only in their schema design and semantic representations, but also in how information must be retrieved, e.g., via complex aggregation queries. Current approaches (Mavromatis and Karypis, 2024; Luo et al., 2024a; Jiang et al., 2024) use graph retrievers specifically fine-tuned for a particular KG, but require training data, which may not be available due to privacy concerns or practical limitations.

Alternative methods utilize LLMs to traverse the graph step-by-step until arriving at the answers or until termination in an agentic fashion (Jiang et al.,

- 2023a; Sun et al., 2024). These methods leverage the inherent knowledge within LLMs to handle ‘bring-your-own’ scenarios, where training data is unavailable for KGQA. However, such approaches have limitations: Extracting knowledge from custom KGs may require operations like performing complex graph aggregations which is not readily obtained via LLM-based traversal.

In this work, we introduce BYOKG-RAG, a framework that addresses these challenges through multi-strategy graph retrieval. Our key insight is to leverage LLMs as a KG-Linker that generates diverse graph artifacts - from entity mentions to executable queries. These artifacts are then processed by specialized graph tools, each designed to handle different retrieval scenarios effectively. Given a user query and the KG schema1, the LLM is prompted to generate relevant graph artifacts, such as question and answer entities, relationship types, and executable graph queries. Subsequently, the graph toolkit takes these artifacts as input, links them to the KG and retrieves relevant graph context through different retrieval methods. The retrieved context can be used in an iterative fashion so that KG-Linker improves the accuracy of both the generated artifacts and subsequent retrieval, before final KGQA. Compared to agentic retrieval, which is restricted to the graph context that can be explored by the agent, BYOKG-RAG retrieves context from multiple linking and retrieval tools, including agentic retrieval, to enhance KGQA accuracy; see Figure 1 for a high-level comparison.

Our contributions are summarized below:

- • We introduce BYOKG-RAG, a novel framework that improves KGQA across custom KGs via multi-strategy graph linking and retrieval.
- • BYOKG-RAG outperforms the best graph retrieval method by 4.5% points in KGQA across four KGs. In addition, BYOKGRAG achieves on-par or better performance than state-of-the-art KG agents on key benchmarks.

1The schema typically expresses the node and relation types present in the graph, among other properties, and is available in common graph databases via graph.get_schema() functionality.

• Our thorough evaluation across KGs with diverse semantics demonstrates the benefits of multi-strategy graph retrieval, and we opensource our toolkit.

### 2 Background & Related Work

#### 2.1 Problem Formulation

Consider a Knowledge Graph (KG) G containing facts represented as triplets (h,r,t), where h represents the head entity, t represents the tail entity, and r denotes the relation between them. The task of KGQA involves extracting a set of entities A ∈ G that correctly answer a given natural language question q. Since KGs typically contain millions of facts and nodes, retrieval-augmented generation retrieves relevant graph context C, which is then used by LLM to generate the answers as A = LLM(q,C). To retrieve C, common approaches combine entity linking techniques (Yih et al., 2015) to identify question entities eq with graph retrieval methods that extract relevant information within an L-hop neighborhood of these entities (Sun et al., 2018).

#### 2.2 Related Works

KGQA Methods. KGQA methods involve either fine-tuning or zero-shot/few-shot inference. Finetuning methods encompass several approaches. Some methods focus on parsing the given question into a logical form query executable over the KG (Sun et al., 2020; Lan and Jiang, 2020a; Ye et al.,

- 2022; Gu et al., 2023; Agarwal et al., 2023). Others involve training specialized neural networks for handling KG data (Sun et al., 2018; He et al., 2021; Mavromatis and Karypis, 2022; Jiang et al., 2023b). Recent approaches aim at teaching LLMs to better understand KG semantics (Luo et al., 2024a; Ao et al., 2025) or instructing the LLM on how to explore the graph (Jiang et al., 2024; Luo et al., 2025a; Zhang et al., 2025). Zero-shot and fewshot methods typically rely on LLMs’ knowledge and combine them with appropriate graph tools for graph traversal (Jiang et al., 2023a; Kim et al.,
- 2023; Sun et al., 2024; Dong et al., 2025; Sui et al.,
- 2024; Jo et al., 2025), graph querying (Li et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023), and constrained decoding on KGs (Luo et al., 2024b; Li et al., 2024a). BYOKG-RAG is a novel framework for improving graph linking and retrieval in “bring-your-own-KG” (zero-shot) settings.

work of using context originating from a graph or a KG within RAG (Edge et al., 2024; He et al.,

- 2024; Mavromatis and Karypis, 2024). Recently, methods (Gutiérrez et al., 2024; Guo et al., 2024; Luo et al., 2025b; Chen et al., 2025) use LLMs for constructing KGs out of raw data to improve information retrieval with graph information (Lee et al., 2024; Sarmah et al., 2024), beyond text-based semantics. With the increased deployment of KGpowered applications (Peng et al., 2024), BYOKGRAG offers a multi-strategy toolkit for retrieving task-specific graph information.

Graph Linking. Entity linking (Yadav and Bethard, 2019) in KGs maps mentions in natural language to their corresponding graph entities and has been extensively studied in KGQA systems (Yih et al., 2015; Oliya et al., 2021; Li et al., 2020). Beyond entity linking, some approaches focus on mapping natural language questions to graph paths (Saxena et al., 2020; Shi et al., 2021) and subgraphs via graph query execution (Lan and Jiang, 2020b; Gu and Su, 2022; Shu et al., 2022; Yu et al., 2022; Gao et al., 2025), typically employing training data for more accurate linking and retrieval. KG-Linker extends these ideas by combining multiple linking approaches with LLM capabilities, enabling robust graph retrieval without task-specific training data.

### 3 Bring-Your-Own-KG RAG (BYOKG-RAG)

In BYOKG-RAG, we address the challenges of graph retrieval in custom KGs through a novel two-stage approach. First, we prompt an LLM (KG-Linker) to generate graph artifacts - including entities, paths, and queries - that serve as anchor points for graph retrieval. Then, these artifacts are processed by specialized graph tools that link them to the underlying KG and retrieve relevant context through multiple complementary methods. This synergistic combination of LLM-generated artifacts and specialized graph tools enables more robust retrieval across custom KGs. The overall framework is illustrated in Figure 2.

#### 3.1 KG-Linker

The key insight behind KG-Linker is to leverage LLMs’ natural language understanding to generate diverse graph artifacts that can be linked to the KG through specialized tools. In KG-Linker, given an input a user query, a graph schema, and an optional graph context, an LLM is prompted to generate graph artifacts, including question entities, draft answers, useful relation paths, and graph queries. The LLM’s prompt includes four main tasks: (1) Entity Extraction, (2) Relation Path Identification, and (3) Graph Query Generation, and (4): Draft

###### KG-Linker’s Prompt p.

Given a question, schema, and optional graph context, your role is to perform the following tasks:

###### Task: Entity Extraction

Extract all topic entities from the question and useful intermediate entities from the graph context (if provided) within <entities> tags.

###### Task: Relationship Path Identification

Identify all relevant relationship paths that connect the entities and can be used to answer the question within <paths> tags.

Task: Graph Query Generation Construct a complete, executable graph query statement that will retrieve the answer from a graph database. Format your query in {openCypher} language within <opencypher> tags. Task: Draft Answer Generation Answer the question using your existing knowledge base or the external information in the graph context (if provided) within <answer> tags. Now, please analyze the following: Question: {question} Schema: {schema} Graph Context: {graph_context}

- Figure 3: The prompt template used in KG-Linker. Full prompts are provided in Appendix F.1.

Answer Generation.

The instruction template p is presented in Figure 3, where {question} is the input user query,

{schema} is the KG schema, including node types and relations, and {graph_context} denotes the graph context retrieved from intermediate steps (if available). {openCypher} may be replaced with other graph query languages. Based on the LLM prompt, the generated graph artifacts are the following,

E˜ = LLM(task = “Entity Extraction”), (1)

- P˜ = LLM(task = “Path Identification”), (2)
- Q˜ = LLM(task = “Graph Query Generation”),

(3) A˜ = LLM(task = “Draft Answering”), (4)

where E˜, P˜, Q˜, and A˜ denote the generated entities, paths, graph query, and answer entities, respectively. Note that those graph artifacts can be generated by a single LLM call.

#### 3.2 Entity Linking

Entity linking is fundamental to our framework, enabling graph traversal from accurate graph anchor points. Entity linking maps LLM-generated entities Eˆ = E˜∪ A˜ to actual entities E in the graph, e.g., “Jamaican people”  → “Jamaica”. We use the textual descriptions of the entities to perform entity linking and implement two complementary linking methods: fuzzy-string matching, and node embedding linking.

For each entity eˆi ∈ Eˆ, we retrieve top-m entities present in the graph based on string match scores, node embedding similarity, or the union of both, where m is a hyperparameter, defaulting to m = 3. By default, we use string-based matching2 and the encoder used for transforming entity names into embeddings is bge-m3 (Chen et al., 2024). After performing entity linking, we obtain the linked entity set E, where |E| ≤ m · |E|ˆ when using single linking method, or |E| ≤ 2m · |E|ˆ when using both string and embedding-based linking.

#### 3.3 Path Retrieval

Path retrieval executes and validates the LLMgenerated paths while discovering alternative routes in the graph that can lead to the required information. Formally, it takes as input the generated chain of relations P˜, executes them on the graph, and returns the resulting intermediate entities along with the relation paths. We implement a follow-paths functionality which takes as input a sequence of relations P˜ and source entities E and returns the executable paths Pf ⊂ P˜ over the graph G as

Pf = Follow-Paths(P˜,E,G). (5)

We perform a breadth-first search starting from the source entities, exploring the graph until all valid paths generated by KG-Linker are found or no further valid paths remain. As source entities, we use the linked entities E of the entity linking step Section 3.2.

In addition, we retrieve the shortest paths connecting the extracted entities E and candidate answers A generated by the LLM (if non-empty). We implement a shortest-paths functionality which returns

Ps = Shortest-Paths(E,A,G) (6)

2https://github.com/seatgeek/thefuzz

based on the candidate entities and answers, using the Dijkstra algorithm3. Path retrieval returns

P = Pf ∪ Ps. (7)

#### 3.4 Graph Query Retrieval

Graph query retrieval translates natural language into executable graph operations, crucial for handling complex queries in enterprise KGs. As a default, we prompt the LLM to generate a query Q˜ in openCypher language which is common in graph databases like Neptune and Neo4j. This step requires the graph to be stored in a format that supports the execution of the generated graph language queries. We implement an execute-query functionality which takes as input a query Q˜ and returns

Qa = Execute-Query(Q,˜ G), (8) which are the query execution results over G.

#### 3.5 Triplet Retrieval

Triplet retrieval complements the above methods by capturing relevant facts that might be missed through direct retrieval. Triplet retrieval operates on the triplet-level granularity of the KG, where triplets T are formatted as (h,r,t) and express natural language descriptions as “head −→ relation −→ tail”, e.g., “Jamaica → language_spoken → English”. We implement two approaches: agentic retrieval for step-by-step exploration, and scoringbased retrieval for more efficient semantic matching.

Agentic Retrieval. Given the linked entities E and the query q, agentic retrieval fetches the relevant triplets Tq, using an LLM that iteratively traverses the KG based on q. We provide the algorithm in Algorithm 1 and the LLM prompts are in Appendix F.2.

At each iteration t, we obtain one-hop candidate triplets Tqt and prompt the LLM to select the most relevant relations Rtq. The triplets are filtered based on the LLM’s selection and subsequently we prompt the LLM to select the most relevant entities Eqt to explore next. The process is terminated until self-termination (empty entity set to explore) or until we reach the maximum agentic iterations TA, defaulting to TA = 3. The agent returns the graph context Tq explored until termination.

Scoring-based Retrieval. Alternative to LLMbased traversal, scoring-based retrieval performs

top-k triplet selection Tq based on question-triplet semantic similarity, where |Tq| = k and k is a hyperparameter. In Appendix A, we present an implementation that uses reranker models to select relevant triplets within L-hop distance from linked entities. Our framework also supports a more efficient embedding-based retrieval approach.

#### 3.6 Iterative Process

BYOKG-RAG’s iterative process enables progressive refinement of retrieved context. Each iteration combines information from multiple retrieval methods, allowing the LLM to generate more accurate artifacts based on accumulated context. BYOKGRAG’s iterative process is presented Algorithm 2. After graph linking and retrieval, we collect the retrieved context

##### C = Tq ∪ Pf ∪ Ps ∪ Qa, (9)

and verbalize it with predefined templates. As shown in Algorithm 2, the context C is used as input to KG-Linker’s prompt (Figure 3) to iteratively refine its generations E˜, P˜, Q˜, and A˜. By default, we have TR = 2 iterations, but we include self-termination when the KG-Linker does not provide new entities to link. Finally, we collect the graph context C as input for the final KGQA task.

- 13: Output: Answers A.

### 4 Experimental Setup

#### 4.1 Datasets & Metrics

We evaluate KGQA benchmarks spanning different backbone KGs. The statistics are provided in Appendix B.

WebQSP (Yih et al., 2015) and ComplexWebQuestions (CWQ) (Talmor and Berant, 2018) involve questions answerable over the Freebase KG (Bollacker et al., 2008). WebQSP and CWQ contain 1,628 and 3,531 questions, respectively, and involve general knowledge about entities, requiring 1-2 hop and 1-4 hop KG traversal, respectively. WebQSP-IH and CWQ-IH refer to in-house subsets, containing 500 questions each from the original set. For pre-processing the Freebase KG, we follow standard steps from previous works (He et al., 2021).

CronQuestions (Saxena et al., 2021) are questions that require temporal reasoning over a KG subset of Wikidata, which contains temporal information (Lacroix et al., 2020). As the tempral KG contains quadruples (head, relation, tail, timestamp), we convert them to triplets (head, relation: timestamp, tail). We focus on CronQuestions’s subset of complex questions and we sample 200 per question type (before/after, first/last, time join) resulting into 600 questions.

MedQA (Jin et al., 2021) consists of questions extracted from USMLE exams. We combine MedQA with Disease DrugBank KG (Wishart et al., 2018), following previous works (Yasunaga et al., 2021). Since the KG may not be relevant for all questions, we filter for questions whose answer candidates appear in the KG (via entity match-

ing). Additionally, we remove MedQA’s multiple choices from the LLM’s context to increase the benchmark’s difficulty.

The Text2cypher dataset (Ozsoy et al., 2024) emulates text2cypher queries encountered in enterprise KGs, such as Northwind. As not all groundtruth queries are executable over the KGs provided in the benchmark, we filter for questions whose ground-truth answers can be retrieved from the graphs.

Metrics. Similar to previous works, we report the Hit metric for WebQSP, CWQ, and CronQuestions, which measures if the LLM generates any correct answer via exact string matching. In MedQA, we report Hit@2 (H@2) by augmenting the LLM generation based on the retrieved KG context with its original prediction, and measure if correct answers are found. For Text2cypher, we use Claude-Sonnet-3.5 as an LLM-as-a-judge (LLMaaJ) that scores if the executed results match the ground-truth results (1.0: correct, 0.5: partially correct, 0.0: incorrect). We also evaluate retrieval accuracy by Recall@k which measures if correct answers are found within top-k retrieval results.

#### 4.2 Competing Methods

Baselines. As key baselines, we include components present within BYOKG-RAG’s framework. Vanilla LLM is the approach of direct QA without KG context. LLM+graph-query prompts the LLM to generate an executable graph query, and augments the LLM’s direct predictions along with the execution results. For MedQA, we prompt the LLM to generate answers based on the execution results. Text-based Retrieval (Appendix A.1) retrieves top-k triplets based on embedding similarity, while Graph Reranker (Appendix A.2) uses a reranker to select top-k triplets within L = 2 hops of linked entities. We use k = 50 for Freebase, k = 10 for the rest KGs. Agentic Traversal (Algorithm 1) is the LLM-based KG traversal and retrieval as described in Algorithm 1. Note that Graph Reranker and Agentic Traversal require entity linking as a first step, and we also incorporate entity linking in LLM+graph-query for better query generation. We employ the same LLM across methods for downstream KGQA, after graph retrieval.

For a fair comparison, we focus on zero/fewshot methods and evaluate against established KG agents, including those using agentic traversal (Jiang et al., 2023a; Sun et al., 2024; Sui et al., 2024) and LLM-guided graph retrieval (Li et al.,

2023; Dong et al., 2025).

BYOKG-RAG Implementation. We implement BYOKG-RAG with default hyperparameters as described within subsections of Section 3. We use entity linking with top-m = 3 via combining string and embedding-based matching. When executing graph queries, we store the KG in NeptuneAnalytics4 and query the database with openCypher5. We retrieve triplets via agentic-based retrieval, and we combine it with top-k = 10 efficient text-based retrieval. We also present results for ‘BYOKG-RAG (scoring)’, which substitutes the agentic retrieval with the scoring-based approach in Appendix A.2. For the LLMs used in KGLinker, we experiment with Claude-Sonnet-3.5, Claude-Haiku-3.5 (Anthropic, 2024), and Llama3.3-70B (Grattafiori et al., 2024), accessed via Bedrock API6.

### 5 Experimental Results

#### 5.1 Main Results

Table 1 demonstrates the effectiveness of BYOKGRAG across diverse KGQA benchmarks. On the Freebase-KG benchmarks, BYOKG-RAG achieves 86.6% and 73.6% Hit rates on WebQSPIH and CWQ-IH respectively, outperforming the best baseline methods (86.2% and 69.3%). The improvement is also pronounced on specialized KGs: for temporal reasoning on CronQuestions, BYOKG-RAG achieves a 65.5% Hit rate, showing a significant gain over text-based retrieval (59.8%). Similarly, on the medical domain MedQA benchmark, BYOKG-RAG improves H@2 performance to 65.0% compared to graph-query’s 59.2%. The framework’s generalization capability is further demonstrated on enterprise KGs, where it achieves 64.9% LLMaaJ score on Northwind, outperforming graph-query (55.3%). Table 1 also evaluates BYOKG-RAG using different LLM backbones. While Claude-Sonnet-3.5 performs best overall, the performance improvements are consis-

tent across Claude-Haiku-3.5 and Llama-3.3-70B, indicating that our framework’s benefits are robust across different LLMs. Using Claude-Sonnet-3.5, BYOKG-RAG outperforms the strongest baseline across benchmarks (agentic retrieval for WebQSPIH/CWQ-IH, text-based retrieval for CronQuestions, and graph querying for MedQA/Northwind) by 4.5% points, on average.

In Table 2, we compare BYOKG-RAG against state-of-the-art zero/few-shot KGQA methods on WebQSP and CWQ benchmarks. BYOKG-RAG achieves the best performance on WebQSP (87.1% Hit rate) and comparable results on CWQ (71.1%), while requiring fewer LLM calls than competing methods. Notably, BYOKG-RAG’s more efficient scoring-based variant maintains strong performance while using only 2-3 LLM calls.

On Freebase benchmarks (WebQSPIH, CWQ-IH), agentic traversal shows strong performance (86.2%, 69.3% with Claude-Sonnet3.5), indicating step-by-step graph exploration is well-suited for multi-hop queries. For temporal reasoning in CronQuestions, text-based retrieval proves effective (60.2% Hit with Llama-3.3-70B), suggesting temporal information can be captured

through semantic matching. For the medical domain (MedQA), the combination of different retrieval methods in BYOKG-RAG yields notable improvements (65.0% H@2 with Claude-Sonnet3.5). Most distinctively, on enterprise KGs (Northwind), the ability to generate and execute Cypher queries proves crucial, with BYOKG-RAG achieving 64.9% accuracy and LLM+graph-query achieving 55.3% with Claude-Sonnet-3.5.

linking beyond entity matching alone. On CWQIH, KG-Linker improves performance from 63.0% to 71.6% with scoring-based retrieval and from

- 69.3% to 73.6% with agentic retrieval. Similar gains are observed on CronQuestions.

Table 4 compares retrieval effectiveness across different methods. While supervised methods like RoG, SubgraphRAG, and GNN-RAG achieve Recall@10 scores of 54.5-64.1% using substantial training data (27.6K-30.5K examples), BYOKGRAG performs competitively without any training data.

Furthermore, we provide a case study on how BYOKG-RAG iteratively improves its retrieval in Table 5.

Additional experiments and cases studies are in Appendix D and E.

### 6 Conclusion

We introduced BYOKG-RAG, a framework that enhances KGQA by combining LLMs with graph retrieval tools. Through extensive experiments across five benchmarks, we demonstrated that multi-strategy graph retrieval matters: BYOKGRAG leverages multiple retrieval methods to achieve superior performance (4.5 percentage points improvement over the strongest baselines) while generalizing effectively to KGs with diverse semantics.

### Limitations

BYOKG-RAG leverages diverse graph tools to retrieve context, enabling more effective KGQA across custom KGs. However, without proper context pruning mechanisms, the retrieved context may become too lengthy and potentially confuse LLMs with limited context-handling capabilities (Liu et al., 2023). Furthermore, our current work considers the KG as the sole source of external information. Future work could expand BYOKG-RAG’s capabilities by incorporating additional information sources, such as text databases (Wu et al., 2024), thereby enhancing the framework’s applications.

### A Scoring-based Triplet Retrieval

Alternatively to the the LLM-based traversal of Section 3.5, scoring-based retrieval performs top-k triplet selection Tq based on question-triplet semantic similarity, where |Tq| = k and k is a hyperparameter.

#### A.1 Text-based Retrieval

Text-based retrieval converts KG triplets T into natural language statements and retrieves the top-k triplets based on their semantic similarity to the question. Since computing embeddings for all triplets in real-world KGs is computationally prohibitive, we adopt an efficient embedding decomposition approach (Li et al., 2024b). Specifically, we decompose triplets into head, relation, and tail components, pre-compute embeddings for individual nodes and relations, and aggregate their similarity scores with the question. Formally, this approach is expressed as:

Tq = arg top-k

(h,r,t)∈T

Embed(q,h)+ Embed(q,r)+ Embed(q,t) , (10)

where Embed computes cosine similarity using pretrained embedding models (Chen et al., 2024), implemented efficiently via FAISS (Douze et al., 2024)7 .

#### A.2 Graph Reranker

Given linked entities E (Section 3.2) and query q, the graph reranker module retrieves the top-k most

7https://huggingface.co/

relevant triplets by reranking (Gao et al., 2023) triplets within an L-hop neighborhood of E.

First, we collect triplets T (L) within an L-hop distance from E as

##### T (L) =

{(h,r,t) ∈ Ge(L)} (11)

e∈E

where Ge(L) denotes the L-hop subgraph starting from entity e, and L is a hyperparameter that defaults to L = 2.

Since the number of triplets |T (L)| can be excessively large in dense graphs, we implement a two-step pruning process: first filtering out triplets with irrelevant relations, then eliminating irrelevant triplets from the remaining set. We use a lightweight reranker model (bge-reranker-base cross-encoder (Xiao et al., 2023)) to maintain the most relevant relations

Rq = arg top-kr Reranker(q,R(L)) , (12)

which returns the top-kr most relevant relations to the question q, where R(L) is the relation set in T (L), |Rq| = kr, and kr = 20 by default. Next, we collect triplets of which relations are present in Rq t9 Tr(L) = {(h,r,t) ∈ T (L) : r ∈ Rq}, and prune them again to Tq(L) by

Tq(L) = arg top-kt Reranker(q,Tr(L)) , (13)

where kt = 100 by default. Here, we transform the triplets to a natural language description for the reranker with a predefined template. We use a more powerful reranker (bge-reranker-v2-minicpm-layerwise crossencoder) to obtain the final top-k most relevant triplets Tq as

Tq = arg top-k Reranker2(q,Tq(L)) , (14) where |Tq| = k.

### B Dataset Statistics

We provide the dataset statistics in Table 6, along with question examples from each benchmark.

### C Other Evaluation Metrics

LLMaaJ. We conducted preliminary evaluations using LLM-as-a-Judge (LLMaaJ) with ClaudeSonnet-3.5 on the WebQSP-IH and CWQ-IH datasets. The results show an alignment between the Hit@1 and LLMaaJ metrics for BYOKG-RAG:

86.6% Hit@1 vs. 86.8% LLMaaJ on WebQSP-IH, and 73.6% Hit@1 vs. 74.2% LLMaaJ on CWQ-IH.

F1. F1 metric is suitable when question have multiple answers, common in KGQA tasks. BYOKG-RAG is designed to support path-based retrieval and graph query execution, both of which naturally accommodate multiple valid answers. When BYOKG-RAG successfully generates a correct path or Cypher query, it retrieves all associated anchor nodes, returning the full set of valid answers for the question. We conducted a preliminary experiment on the WebQSP-IH dataset using path retrieval. On the subset of questions where the generated paths are executable, we found that the F1 score closely aligns with the Hit@1 metric (80.2% Hit@1 vs. 78.8% F1).

### D Additional Experiments

Table 7 presents the refinement effectiveness (Section 3.6) of BYOKG-RAG. In all cases presented, BYOKG-RAG’s refinement improves the original graph retrieval methods considerably, highlighting the importance of iterative retrieval. To further analyze the impact of iteration count TR, we ran additional experiments with TR = 3. KGLinker includes a self-termination mechanism (Algorithm 2), allowing the retrieval process to stop early once sufficient information has been gathered. For WebQSP-IH, KG-Linker terminates after an average of 1.1 iterations, achieving the same performance as with TR = 2. For CWQ-IH, it terminates after an average of 2.3 iterations, with a marginal performance gain (73.6% for TR = 2 vs. 73.9% for TR = 3). These findings suggest that the selftermination mechanism is effective in adapting to each query.

Table 8 presents a latency analysis, showing that while BYOKG-RAG introduces moderate overhead 2.4× relative to the baseline), it achieves superior performance than agentic retrieval (1.6×).

### E Case Studies

We provide case studies on how BYOKG-RAG improves retrieval in Table 9. In CronQuestion, BYOKG-RAG retrieves the correct answer while Agentic retrieval does not. In CWQ, BYOKGRAG finds the answers step-by-step (1st vs. 2nd iteration), while path retrieval also find relevant information. In MedQA, different components of BYOKG-RAG retrieve information relevant to the correct answer. In Northwind, BYOKG-RAG

Question (MedQA) A 59-year-old overweight woman presents to the urgent care clinic with the complaint of severe abdominal pain for the past 2 hours. She also complains of a dull pain in her back with nausea and vomiting several times. Her pain has no relation with food. Her past medical history is significant for recurrent abdominal pain due to cholelithiasis. Her father died at the age of 60 with some form of abdominal cancer. Her temperature is 37C (98.6F), respirations are 15/min, pulse is 67/min, and blood pressure is 122/98 mm Hg. Physical exam is unremarkable. However, a CT scan of the abdomen shows a calcified mass near her gallbladder. Which of the following diagnoses should be excluded first in this patient

Answer Gallbladder cancer BYOKG-RAG (agent) Gallbladder cancer -> may cause -> Abdominal mass | Cholestatic jaundice | Liver

KG-Linker’s Entity Extraction Prompt

###### Task: Entity Extraction

Extract all topic entities from the question (people, places, organizations, concepts, etc.) that will need to be matched in the graph database.

- - Include all entities that are directly mentioned and relevant to answering the question
- - Use exact names as they appear in the question
- - If an entity reference is vague or ambiguous, include both the mention from the question and potential aliases or full names that might match in the database
- - For organizations or entities with common abbreviations, include both full names and abbreviations when relevant
- - Format your response as follows, where entities are separated by newlines:

<entities> entity1

- entity1_possible_alias
- entity2
- entity3

... </entities>

If no topic entities are present in the question, return empty tags: <entities> </entities>

Task: Relevant Entity Extraction Extract all relevant entities from the graph context and question (people, places, organizations, concepts, etc.) that need to explore next for answering the question. Consider important entities only that are necessary for answering the question. Do not select entities, for which we already have all necessary information.

- - [Same instructions as before]
- - Format your response as follows, where entities are separated by newlines:

<entities> next_entity1

- next_entity1_possible_alias
- next_entity2
- next_entity3

... </entities>

The entites should be sorted from the most important to the least important. If we can answer the question directly based on the provided graph context, respond with: <entities> FINISH </entities>

###### KG-Linker’s Path Generation Prompt

Task: Relationship Path Identification Identify all relevant relationship paths that connect the entities and can be used to answer the question.

- - Only use relationships that are explicitly defined in the provided schema
- - Paths may be single relationships or combinations of multiple relationships
- - Generate at least 3 different meaningful relationship paths when possible, focusing on diversity rather than redundancy
- - If graph context is provided, carefully analyze it to identify additional relevant relationship paths that might lead to the answer, especially focusing on paths to retrieve missing information that is not present in the context
- - Use the context to determine which paths are most likely to yield correct answers based on the information provided
- - Format your response as follows, where paths are separated by newlines:

<paths> relation1 relation1 -> relation2 relation3

... </paths>

For multi-step paths, use the "->" delimiter between relationships. If the question does not require following any relationships, return empty tags: <paths> </paths>

Figure 5: The path generation prompt in KG-Linker.

Figure 4: The entity extraction prompt in KG-Linker. We use the ‘relative’ entity extraction prompt when provided with graph context.

KG-Linker’s Graph Query Generation Prompt

###### Task: OpenCypher Query Generation

Construct a complete, executable OpenCypher statement that will retrieve the answer from a graph database.

- - Your query must only use node types, relationship types, and properties defined in the provided schema
- - Include appropriate MATCH patterns, WHERE clauses, and RETURN statements
- - Handle any filtering, aggregation, or sorting required by the question
- - If graph context is provided, ensure your query incorporates the relevant entities and relationships identified from the context
- - Format your response as follows:

<opencypher> MATCH ... WHERE ... RETURN ... </opencypher>

KG-Linker’s Draft Answer Generation Prompt

###### Task: Question Answering

Answer the question using your existing knowledge base or the external information provided in the graph context (if provided).

- - Provide only direct entity answers that specifically address the question
- - Each answer should be a distinct, well-defined entity (person, place, organization, concept, etc.)
- - List multiple answers if appropriate, with each answer on a separate line
- - Do not include explanations, reasoning, context, or commentary of any kind
- - Do not preface or conclude your answer with statements like "Based on my knowledge..." or "The answers are..."
- - If graph context is provided, prioritize answers that can be derived from the context over general knowledge
- - If you genuinely cannot determine the answer from the provided context or your knowledge base, you may return empty answer tags
- - Format your response exactly as follows, where answers are separated by newlines: <answers>

- answer_entity1
- answer_entity2

... </answers>

If no clear answer can be determined, provide empty tags: <answers> </answers>

###### Relation Selection Prompt

Task: Relation Selection Your task is to select the most appropriate relations based on their relevance to a given question.

Follow these steps:

- 1. Read the provided <question>question</question> carefully.
- 2. Analyze each relation in the <relation> list and determine its relevance to the question and relation.
- 3. Respond by selecting the most relevant relations within <select>relations</select> tags. Be both frugal on your selection and consider completeness.
- 4. The selected relations should be provided line-by-line.

Example format: <question> Name the president of the country whose main spoken language was English in 1980? </question>

<entity> English </entity>

<relations> language.human_language.main_country language.human_language.language_family language.human_language.iso_639_3_code base.rosetta.languoid.parent language.human_language.countries_spoken_in </relations>

<selected> language.human_language.main_country language.human_language.countries_spoken_in base.rosetta.languoid.parent </selected>

Explanation: [short explanation (deprecated due to figure length)]

Important Instructions: Always return at least one relation. Now it is your turn.

<question> {question} </question>

<entity> {entity} </entity>

<relations> {relations} </relations>

Remember to parse your response in <selected></selected> tags:

Entity Selection Prompt

###### Task: Entity Selection

Given a question and the associated retrieved knowledge graph context (entity, relation, entity), you are asked to select the most important entities to explore in order to answer the question. Consider important entities only that are necessary for answering the question. Do not select entities, for which we already have all necessary information.

- Format your response exactly as follows: <nextentities>

- relevant_entity1
- relevant_entity2

... </next-entities>

The selected entities must be provided line-by-line. Example format: Question: Name the president of the country whose main spoken language was English in 1980? Graph Context: English -> countries_spoken_in -> England | USA <next-entities> England USA </next-entities>

The entities should be sorted from the most important to the least important. Important Instruction: If we can answer the question directly based on the provided graph context, respond with: <next-entities> FINISH </next-entities>
