## Abstract

Long-horizon LLM agents generate traces that could become reusable experience, but raw trajectories are noisy, local, and hard to govern. Agent Skills offer a structured artifact for combining procedural guidance, executable resources, and applicability boundaries. Yet open skill ecosystems contain redundant, uneven, environment-sensitive artifacts, and indiscriminate updates can pollute future context. We present SkillsVote, a lifecycle-governance framework for Agent Skills across collection, recommendation, attribution, and evolution. SkillsVote profiles a million-scale open source corpus for environment requirements, quality, and verifiability, and synthesizes tasks for verifiable skills. Before execution, it performs agentic library search over structured skill folders to expose instructional context. After execution, it decomposes trajectories into skill-linked subtasks, attributes outcomes to skill-guided execution, agent exploration, environment, and result signals, and admits only successful reusable discoveries to evidence-gated updates. Experiments on Terminal-Bench 2.0 and SWE-Bench Pro show that SkillsVote improves agent performance on challenging agentic coding benchmarks. The gains arise from two complementary pathways: online evolution over task streams at test time and offline transfer via frozen libraries built from either historical trajectories or curated open source skills.

## 1 Introduction

Recent progress in LLM agents has shifted the research focus from single-turn answer generation to systems that act over long horizons. Contemporary benchmarks require agents to repair realistic codebases [10, 20], navigate web applications [82], operate across desktop environments [68], and manipulate external state through APIs [56], tools, and terminals [36]. These settings produce trajectories of intermediate decisions, tool interactions, and environmental feedback. Prior work on experiential agents shows that such traces can shape later behavior, but only after low-level execution evidence is distilled into reusable experience or skills [52, 59, 76].

Raw trajectories, however, are a poor substrate for durable experience reuse. They are lengthy, noisy, tightly bound to local environments, and often conflate robust strategies with incidental state. Agent Skills offer a more structured schema: they package procedural instructions, scripts, templates, references, dependency boundaries, and applicability conditions into auditable artifacts, making experience more compact than full trajectories while preserving more executable context than isolated natural language summaries [19].

At ecosystem scale, the problem is no longer only how to author an individual skill, but how to control a continuously expanding library. Public skill ecosystems already exhibit scale, redundancy, uneven quality, and safety risks [29]. Skill benchmarks further show that the benefit of skills depends on task, domain, and retrieval setting; weakly related or poorly written skills can degrade agent performance [23, 32]. Treating skills as ecosystem artifacts also changes the failure mode: larger libraries increase coverage, but they also enlarge the search space and amplify library pollution when weakly supported lessons are incorporated indiscriminately. These observations suggest that skill ecosystems at scale require collection, governance, profiling, recommendation, evaluation, and evolution to be treated as coupled processes [22, 78]. Against this background, SkillsVote constructs and profiles a corpus of more than one million open source Agent Skills and governs how skills vote into the agent context before execution and how attributed evidence votes into the skill library after execution.

###### Figure 1 SkillsVote couples pre-task recommendation with post-task attribution and controlled library evolution. A profiled skill library is searched before execution; after execution, trajectories and outcome signals are decomposed into skill-linked subtasks so reusable discoveries can edit existing skills or create new ones.

We introduce SkillsVote, a lifecycle framework for Agent Skills. Before execution, SkillsVote formulates recommendation as agentic search over a structured skill library rather than static semantic matching [24]; it selects a small, relevant skill set with little redundancy and supplies compressed usage context. After execution, SkillsVote performs outcome attribution from the trajectory and visible result signal, explaining how the outcome relates to the selected skill, the agent’s own exploration, environmental conditions, and the evaluation signal itself. These stages form the closed loop shown in Figure 1.

Recent systems for skill evolution show that execution evidence can improve skills by distilling lessons from individual trajectories into transferable skill directories [38], aggregating interaction trajectories across users into shared skill updates [35], and diagnosing bad cases to refine domain skills [31]. SkillsVote uses this evidence under an attribution control layer: it first determines whether a success or failure is attributable to the selected skill, the agent’s own exploration, the environment, or the result signal, and then constrains which experience may enter the evolving skill library. This control prevents spurious successes from being rewarded and keeps failures caused by the environment or evaluation signal from driving irrelevant repository edits. Thus, SkillsVote connects recommendation, attribution, and controlled evolution into an auditable closed loop.

We evaluate SkillsVote on Terminal-Bench 2.0 [36] and SWE-Bench Pro [10]. Our experiments study whether recommendation outperforms directly exposing the initial skill library, whether offline evolution transfers from historical Terminal-Bench Pro trajectories to Terminal-Bench 2.0, and whether online evolution accumulates useful experience in a task stream at test time.

This paper makes the following contributions:

- 1. We formulate an Agent Skill lifecycle framework that connects collection and governance for open skill ecosystems, recommendation, outcome attribution, and controlled evolution.
- 2. We construct and profile a corpus of more than one million open source Agent Skills for systematic analysis and governance of open skill ecosystems.
- 3. We design a loop that uses attribution to connect recommendation and evolution, constraining skill library evolution and reducing the risk of indiscriminate library updates.
- 4. We show that SkillsVote improves online evolution, offline transfer, and skill use controlled by recommendation on Terminal-Bench 2.0 and SWE-Bench Pro public.

## 2 Related Work

Evolution of Agent Experience Learning. Agent experience learning has progressed from records reusable only in context to executable artifacts. Early memory methods store unstructured cases and examples, such as few-shot trajectories, exemplars, or human-curated interaction records [62, 77, 80]. Workflow methods abstract traces into semi-structured workflows and SOPs [13, 65], while strategy-level methods compress experience into principles, heuristics, and strategies [5–7, 47, 61, 72, 76]. Recent tool, MCP, and methods for skill learning attach experience to callable interfaces, dependencies, and execution boundaries [18, 30, 33]. Surveys and systems similarly frame memories, rules, skills, protocols, and harness components as deployment-time external artifacts [25, 27, 28, 73, 74, 79]. SkillsVote focuses on skill libraries: a skill combines procedural text, scripts, dependencies, and applicability boundaries, so experience remains auditable, versionable, and portable across harnesses, while full harness or protocol evolution has a larger action space.

Agent Skill Ecosystems, Retrieval and Evaluation. As Agent Skills become installable and shareable file artifacts [1, 3, 17, 40, 44, 45, 54, 57], the problem shifts from authoring skills to governing and using open ecosystems. AgentSkillOS [22] and SkillNet [26] organize skills as ecosystem objects, while SkillsBench [23], SkillCraft [9], SkVM [8], and SkCC [48] show that utility, compositional use, portability, security, dependencies, and harness compatibility must be evaluated before SKILL.md files can be trusted. SkillsVote profiles open-source skills for format, dependency, quality, and verifiability. At task time, governance does not remove selection: providing skills does not ensure correct selection, composition, or use. SkillRouter learns routing over full skill bodies rather than only names or descriptions [78], while DCI replaces embedding retrieval with

direct corpus interaction over source documents [24]. SkillsVote lightly applies filesystem-native inspection to governed skill folders and outputs compact guidance for combining the selected skills.

Skill-Centric Agent Self Evolution. A growing body of work studies how agents learn and evolve around skill libraries. One line trains policies to decide when to retrieve a skill, how to use it, and when to distill behavior into the model or revise the library [34, 46, 51, 60, 64, 66, 67]. Other systems keep the base model fixed and turn coarse session- or trajectory-level evidence, together with verifier or environment feedback, into reusable skill artifacts [2, 14, 35, 37, 38, 53, 58, 69–71, 75, 81]. SkillsVote further factorizes each trajectory into judged, skill-linked subtasks, localizes the skill knowledge actually used and the responsibility for each outcome, and admits only reusable successful exploration into skill library evolution.

## 3 Approach

SkillsVote treats Agent Skills as lifecycle artifacts: given a skill library, it controls which skills enter the solver agent context before execution and which execution evidence is allowed to update the library afterward. We describe corpus collection, profiling, and task synthesis from skills as preprocessing details in Appendix D.1.

#### 3.1 Skill Recommendation via Agentic Library Search

Existing skill harnesses commonly rely on progressive disclosure: the solver agent first sees lightweight skill metadata, and the full SKILL.md and supporting resources are loaded only after the skill appears relevant [1, 3, 41]. This design lets many skills coexist in one environment, but it also compresses pre-task selection into short descriptions and limited path cues. SkillRouter further shows that, in large skill pools, the full skill body often carries decisive routing signals [78]. SkillsVote builds on this interface by adding an exposure control layer conditioned on the task before the solver agent starts execution.

The motivation extends beyond skill systems. Filesystem-native atomic tools are increasingly used as a general interface for agentic search: DCI lets agents interact directly with corpora in retrieval for deep research rather than consuming a fixed top-k interface [24]; systems for code search, such as CodeScout [55] and SWE-grep [49], train multi-turn localization over ordinary repository tools; Vercel’s studies of data agents compress query exploration and validation into a small set of file and shell operations [15, 50]; and Letta uses a filesystem backend for agent memory retrieval [21]. These examples motivate treating an evolving skill library as a searchable file-based substrate.

Given a task and a skill library, SkillsVote runs a separate recommendation stage. The agent does not solve the task. It searches the local skill library, selectively reads candidate SKILL.md files and related resources, and selects skills that cover the task, fit the target environment, and provide complementary guidance. The output is a compact set of exposed skills plus a short usage guide for the solver agent, rather than the full library, a metadata-only routing decision, or a single-step top-k chunk list. The recommendation record also anchors later attribution: after execution, SkillsVote can inspect whether exposed skills were actually used and whether they contributed reusable discoveries.

#### 3.2 Distilling Execution Traces into Evolvable Units

Recent work exposes a granularity gap in learning from agent execution. Agent evaluation commonly relies on task-level success signals, which are authoritative but provide sparse supervision for long-horizon tool use and make credit assignment difficult [11]. Meanwhile, systems for skill learning show that execution trajectories contain reusable experience that can improve future behavior [12, 38]. However, these works also suggest that trajectories must be filtered before they become reusable artifacts: a run may mix skill-guided actions, independent exploration, corrected failures, and redundant operational steps. At the other end, process-level benchmarks [11] and failure-diagnosis methods [4] annotate individual agent steps, showing the value of local feedback for analysis. However, a single tool call rarely constitutes reusable skill knowledge. As shown in Figure 2, skill evolution thus requires an intermediate unit between full trajectories and individual steps.

SkillsVote addresses this mismatch by inserting a subtask-level attribution layer between full trajectories and individual tool calls. A subtask is the smallest semantically complete unit that can support library evolution: it has one standalone objective, one primary evaluation signal, and at most one associated skill context. The primary evaluation signal specifies what kind of evidence can support the subtask outcome, such as environment feedback, human review, or no explicit signal. Trajectories are split only when one of these three boundaries changes, rather than whenever the agent issues another command. This granularity is local enough to assign responsibility, yet abstract enough to capture reusable procedures, constraints, and recovery patterns.

For each subtask, attribution compresses the execution evidence along three axes:

- 1. Outcome evidence. The system records whether the subtask can be assessed by objective environment feedback, depends on human preference, or lacks an explicit evaluation signal. This prevents verifierbacked outcomes, subjective goals, and unsupported claims from being treated alike.
- 2. Responsibility assignment. The system assigns both the final state and its main cause. Successful subtasks may be credited to skill-guided execution, independent exploration, or exploration after observing an irrelevant skill. Failed or uncertain subtasks are retained as diagnostic evidence, but they do not directly authorize skill evolution.

- 3. Reusable delta. For skill-related subtasks, the system localizes the portions of skill knowledge that actually shaped execution, rather than crediting every exposed skill. It also extracts only reusable discoveries, such as missing procedures, preconditions, or recovery patterns, while discarding ordinary trial-and-error, task-specific constants, and repetitive operational details.

Together, these fields define an evolvable unit for the trajectory evidence in Figure 3: evidence-bound, responsibility-aware, and reusable. These units form the interface to controlled evolution, where only successful subtasks with reusable exploration can propose library updates.

3.3 Evidence-Based Controlled Skill Evolution

The attribution layer produces evolvable units, but library evolution still requires explicit control over what evidence is allowed to change persistent skills. SkillsVote formulates this step as evidence-gated update construction with explicit admissibility, aggregation, and routing criteria.

Admissibility. SkillsVote first filters which units may trigger evolution. A unit is admissible only if it is successful and contains reusable exploration. Failed, uncertain, or weakly supported evidence may remain useful for diagnosis, but it cannot directly authorize a skill update.

Aggregation. Admissible units are then grouped before any edit is made. Units that support the same reusable procedure, precondition, workaround, or correction are merged into a single proposed update, so repeated observations strengthen one change rather than producing duplicate or fragmented edits.

Routing. Finally, SkillsVote routes each aggregated evidence group to an update action. If the evidence extends a skill that actually shaped execution, the system edits that skill through the smallest justified change: fixing incorrect guidance, adding missing knowledge, or tightening prerequisites. If the evidence reflects an independent reusable capability outside the current skill boundary, the system creates a new skill. When evidence is weak, redundant, or semantically misaligned with the target skill, it skips evolution.

Thus, skill evolution is conservative by design: every library change must be supported by attributed execution evidence, localized to the relevant skill boundary, and expressed as reusable procedural knowledge rather than a trajectory recap.

4 Experiments

- 4.1 Experimental Setup We organize the evaluation around three lifecycle questions:

- 1. Offline skill transfer. Can frozen libraries from historical trajectories or curated open source skills improve unseen tasks?
- 2. Online skill evolution. Can SkillsVote accumulate useful skills over a sequential task stream?
- 3. Pre-task recommendation. Given a growing skill library, does pre-task recommendation reduce negative transfer?

Benchmarks. We evaluate with Harbor [16] on Terminal-Bench 2.0 [36] and SWE-Bench Pro public [10], two challenging agentic coding benchmarks. We report avg@5 Accuracy on Terminal-Bench 2.0 and avg@1 Resolve Rate on SWE-Bench Pro public, following their leaderboard protocols.

Configurations. We run Codex with three model and effort pairs: GPT-5.2 medium [39], GPT-5.4 mini medium effort [42], and GPT-5.5 xhigh [43]. For each benchmark and backbone pair, we compare three classes of settings: (1) the w/o skills setting is the base solver without an external skill library; (2) Online settings start from an empty experience library and update it along the task stream at test time; we compare SkillsVote with ReasoningBank [47] and skill-creator, a direct baseline that converts completed trajectories

#### 4.2 Main Results

Tables 1 and 2 report the main results. Across all six benchmark and backbone pairs, SkillsVote improves the overall score over the baseline without skills and is the best online method, or tied for best, in every pair. On Terminal-Bench 2.0, it raises avg@5 Accuracy by ↑2.6 pp, ↑1.1 pp, and ↑0.9 pp for GPT-5.2, GPT-5.4 mini, and GPT-5.5, respectively. On SWE-Bench Pro public, it improves avg@1 Resolve Rate by ↑2.7 pp, ↑2.6 pp, and ↑1.2 pp. The two online baselines are less steady. ReasoningBank and skill-creator improve some smaller model settings, but both regress on GPT-5.5 and show larger swings across difficulty splits and repositories. The methods also differ in what they store for reuse: SkillsVote updates the library after attributing reusable exploration, while the baselines store broader memories derived from trajectories.

Among the offline settings, the historical TB-Pro library gives the strongest Terminal-Bench 2.0 transfer, improving GPT-5.2, GPT-5.4 mini, and GPT-5.5 by ↑7.8 pp, ↑5.8 pp, and ↑1.4 pp, respectively. This suggests that skills derived from trajectories can capture reusable terminal procedures beyond the historical Terminal-Bench Pro tasks used to build the library. The curated open source library is less consistent: it improves Terminal-Bench 2.0 for GPT-5.2 and GPT-5.4 mini by ↑3.7 pp and ↑4.0 pp, but reduces GPT-5.5 by

#### 4.3 Analysis

The main results show consistent gains from online evolution and the strongest offline gains from a related trajectory library. We next analyze three mechanisms behind this pattern: whether SkillsVote can route over large and confusable skill libraries, whether pre-task recommendation filters harmful skill exposure, and whether offline evolution yields skills that transfer beyond the historical tasks used to build them.

##### 4.3.1 Routing over Large Skill Libraries

Before studying downstream task solving, we isolate the problem of skill routing itself. We evaluate on SkillRouter’s public set [78], which contains 75 queries verified by experts and a hard pool of 79,141 skills with 780 distractors. We compare the released SkillRouter embedding and reranker pipeline with SkillsVote as the candidate pool scales from 1k to the full library; Appendix C.1 gives the construction and metrics, and Appendix B.1 reports the full results.

Table 3 Main results for skill routing at the largest skill pool. Scores are percentages; cost is averaged per query.

- Figure 4 Scaling behavior of skill routing as the candidate library grows from 1k to 79,141 skills. Top: FC@10 across pool sizes. Bottom: average API cost per query for SkillsVote.

- Figure 4 summarizes the scaling trend, and Table 3 reports the comparison at the largest pool. FC@10 declines with pool size for all methods, reflecting the increasing difficulty of complete coverage in larger and more confusable libraries. With a capable recommender model, however, SkillsVote scales better: GPT-5.5 remains above SkillRouter in FC@10 across all pool sizes and reaches 62.7 at full scale, compared with 46.7 for SkillRouter. At the full pool, GPT-5.4 matches SkillRouter on Hit@1 and improves FC@10 to 54.7. The average API cost changes little from 1k to the full pool, suggesting that the search procedure does not grow proportionally with the size of the candidate library. GPT-5.4 mini drops at 50k and full scale, indicating that routing over large libraries still depends on the capability of the recommender model.

4.3.2 Recommendation Controls Negative Transfer

- Figure 5 measures the effect of recommendation conditioned on the task before skill exposure. Directly exposing the online library yields larger negative than positive deltas at the task level: the mean gain/loss contribution is +3.3/−6.7. Recommendation removes the net negative effect, yielding a balanced +6.0/−6.0 profile. In the early online regime, recommendation mainly acts as a noise filter: it prevents sparse, underspecified, or weakly related skills from entering the solver context. The offline setting gives a cleaner view of the same mechanism. The transferred library is already useful without recommendation, but recommendation increases the mean positive contribution from +11.3 to +15.3 and reduces the loss from −3.3 to −2.0. Thus, evolution and recommendation play complementary roles. Evolution creates potentially reusable procedural knowledge, while recommendation decides whether that knowledge should be exposed to the current task. This also explains why the average gains in Tables 1 and 2 are moderate despite large improvements on some tasks: the effect of skills is heavy tailed, helping substantially when matched well but causing regressions when exposed indiscriminately.

###### Figure 5 Recommendation controls harmful skill exposure on Terminal-Bench 2.0 Hard; cells show avg@5 deltas at the task level over the baseline without skills.

##### 4.3.3 Offline Evolution Accumulates Transferable Procedures

Offline evolution uses source benchmark feedback for post-task attribution. Ground truth and verifier signals enter only after task completion, helping determine which parts of the trajectory were successful, reusable, and properly attributable. The evolution stage then consumes attributed subtask records, and reusable exploration excludes constants specific to the benchmark or gold outputs.

- Figure 6 reflects this separation. Terminal-Bench Pro performance fluctuates across checkpoints, whereas the frozen libraries transfer increasingly well to unseen Terminal-Bench 2.0 Hard tasks. The Terminal-Bench Pro curve is nonmonotonic, which separates benchmark performance from library utility on the transfer benchmark. The transfer improvement shows reusable operational procedures accumulating across a task distribution shift. The panel for library growth further shows evolution as consolidation: new skills are created, and existing skills are edited as repeated evidence accumulates into persistent skill artifacts.

## 5 Conclusion

SkillsVote frames Agent Skills as managed lifecycle artifacts for long-horizon agents. It connects a millionscale corpus of open source skills with execution readiness profiling, recommendation conditioned on the task, subtask-level outcome attribution, and evidence-gated evolution. This lifecycle view targets two coupled risks in growing skill libraries: irrelevant skills can distract agents before execution, while weakly supported or misattributed experience can pollute the library after execution. By searching structured skill folders before a task and admitting only successful, reusable discoveries supported by attribution after a task, SkillsVote turns execution traces into conservative updates to persistent skills. Experiments on Terminal-Bench 2.0 and SWE-Bench Pro show that governed skill libraries improve frozen agents through two complementary routes: online evolution over task streams at test time and recommendation over frozen libraries built from either historical execution trajectories or curated open source skills. These results position governed skill libraries as a practical substrate for scalable agent experience reuse.

## A Extended Analysis

#### A.1 Skill Characteristics

Skill quality and verifiability. During profiling, SkillsVote evaluates skills using the explicit quality and verifiability rubrics defined in Tables 8 and 9. Figure 7 shows that the corpus is strongly positive on consistency and orientation, while substantially fewer skills satisfy completeness, success verifiability, and task constructability. This suggests that many skills are coherent reusable guidance units, but a smaller fraction can be turned directly into low-ambiguity, benchmark-constructable tasks.

Skill categories. After format validation, content deduplication, and profiling, we obtain category statistics for more than 290K skills, following the category definitions listed in Table 10. Figure 8 shows that Development dominates the governed corpus, followed by AgentMeta and Tools. The strongest co-occurrence pattern is between Development and AgentMeta, indicating that development-oriented skills frequently appear together with higher-level agent guidance. The visible links from Development to DevOps and Testing further suggest that many development skills also incorporate testing and DevOps knowledge. This overlap indicates that these adjacent software-engineering domains require substantial accumulated development-oriented skills, rather than being represented primarily as standalone knowledge artifacts.

Skill filtration. After collecting more than 1.68M skills, SkillsVote applies format validation, deduplication, and quality analysis in sequence. Each stage removes a substantial portion of the raw corpus collected from GitHub; Appendix E.1 gives the procedural details. Figure 9 shows that repository stars remain heavily concentrated in the long tail below 100 stars throughout all curation stages, while stricter filtering moves only a limited share of skills toward repositories with more stars. This pattern suggests that GitHub popularity alone is not a reliable proxy for whether a skill is valid, distinct, or ready for execution. It therefore motivates explicit corpus governance rather than selection heuristics based on repository popularity.

Skill names. Figure 11 summarizes the 20 most frequently repeated skill names in the open-skill ecosystem. The distribution is highly concentrated: skill-creator appears more than 5K times, while frontend-design appears more than 3K times. This concentration suggests that meta-skills dominate the open-skill ecosystem. Beyond these meta-skills, the other repeated names mostly correspond to broad workflows, such as frontend design, code debugging, testing, and document processing.

Skill runtime requirements. Figure 10 summarizes the runtime-requirement profile of the open-source skill corpus, with results covering approximately one million evaluated skills. Unknown values are not shown. Linux and macOS dominate the operating-system profile, workspace and system write scopes are more common than read-only execution, and offline or secured settings outweigh open online access. Together with the frequent command line tools, environment variables, and MCP servers, these patterns suggest that users mainly rely on agents for programming and automation workflows that require real toolchains, runtime configuration, and controlled external systems rather than model-only knowledge.

All methods decline as the candidate pool grows, but the decline is uneven across metrics and model sizes. FC@10 is the most sensitive metric because it requires every ground-truth skill to appear in the top 10, making it stricter than Hit@1 for the majority multi-skill queries. GPT-5.5 maintains the strongest FC@10 across all pool sizes and remains above SkillRouter by 16.0 points at the full pool with 79,141 skills. GPT-5.4 is competitive through the full pool, matching SkillRouter on Hit@1 at full scale while improving FC@10 by 8.0 points. GPT-5.4 mini performs well at small and medium pools but drops sharply at 50k and full scale, suggesting that this routing strategy depends on model capability when the skill library becomes highly confusable.

## C Experiment Details

Common settings. Unless noted otherwise, within a given benchmark, SkillsVote and all baselines share the same agent harness, solver configuration, timeout policy, retry policy, and verifier settings. All runs use Codex CLI 0.125.0 with three model-effort pairs: GPT-5.2 with medium reasoning effort, GPT-5.4 mini with medium reasoning effort, and GPT-5.5 with xhigh reasoning effort. We also disable built-in system skills and plugins for solver agent to reduce the impact of redundant context.

#### C.1 SkillRouter

Dataset. The large-scale routing study uses SkillRouter’s public evaluation set [78], which contains 75 expertverified task queries after filtering ambiguous mappings: 24 single-skill queries and 51 multi-skill queries. We use the released Hard pool, which contains 79,141 skills including 780 LLM-generated distractors. For scoring, the expert-verified ground-truth skill set for each query defines the target skills; auxiliary annotations are retained in the data files but are not used in the reported metrics.

Skill pool splits. Each evaluated pool contains all ground-truth skills for the 75 queries, the listed number of distractors, and additional non-ground-truth skills from the released pool until reaching the target size. This keeps every query scorable at each scale while increasing the size and confusability of the candidate library.

- Table 5 reports the split sizes.

SkillRouter baseline. The SkillRouter baseline uses the released 0.6B embedding model and 0.6B reranker. Skill documents are encoded from the full skill text, formatted as name, description, and body. For each query, we retrieve the top 50 skills by embedding similarity, pass the top 20 retrieved skills to the reranker, and score the final top 10. We report API cost for SkillsVote only.

SkillsVote routing configuration. For SkillsVote, each candidate skill is represented as one markdown file in the candidate directory. SkillsVote runs in a read-only Codex environment rooted at this directory, with web search, built-in skills, plugins, writes, and command approvals disabled. We evaluate GPT-5.5, GPT-5.4, and GPT-5.4 mini with xhigh reasoning effort. The model must return exactly 10 existing skill files ranked by relevance; no downstream task execution is performed. Appendix G.3 reports the SkillRouter routing prompt pair. Cost is computed from input, cached-input, and output tokens using LiteLLM pricing and then averaged per completed query.

Metrics. We report Hit@1, Recall@10, and FC@10. Hit@1 is 1 when any ground-truth skill appears at rank 1. Recall@10 is the fraction of ground-truth skills appearing in the top 10. FC@10 is 1 only when every ground-truth skill appears in the top 10. Single-skill and multi-skill slices are defined by the number of ground-truth skills for a query.

#### C.2 Terminal-Bench 2.0

Dataset. Terminal-Bench 2.0 contains 89 terminal tasks inspired by real workflows, including 4 Easy, 55 Medium, and 30 Hard instances [36]. The dataset contains 16 task categories; representative categories include

software engineering, debugging, security, machine learning, scientific computing, and other terminal-centric technical workflows. Each task provides a unique container environment, a human-written reference solution, and executable verification tests.

Configuration. We allow up to 3 retries for environment-related failures, primarily Docker sandbox startup or runtime errors and external API timeouts. Post-execution failures are excluded from retry, including verifier timeouts and verifier runtime failures, which are treated as final trial outcomes because they are more likely to reflect agent capability or solution quality than transient noise. We set the agent timeout to 4 times the benchmark default to absorb long command waits and API instability, while leaving all other settings at their benchmark defaults.

For GPT-5.5 with xhigh reasoning effort on Terminal-Bench 2.0, OpenAI’s cyber-risk review blocks requests for password-recovery, crack-7z-hash, vulnerable-secret, and model-extraction-relu-logits. We therefore skip these four tasks in every GPT-5.5 setting on this benchmark and exclude them from the final averages, so all reported GPT-5.5 results on Terminal-Bench 2.0 are computed over the remaining 85 tasks.

Evaluation metric. We report the leaderboard’s avg@5 Accuracy. Accuracy indicates whether a task is solved, and avg@5 averages the success rate over five independent runs per task before averaging across tasks.

Offline skill evolution. For the offline skill evolution experiment, we use 48 public tasks in software engineering and system administration from Terminal-Bench Pro [63], after excluding two tasks whose Docker images could not be built reliably. We run one full pass over these 48 tasks with recommendation and evolution both enabled. The pass executes one synchronized batch of 4 tasks at a time and completes post-execution attribution for every task in the batch. After the batch completes, we aggregate the attributed subtasks derived from the 4 tasks and pass them to a single evolution step, which improves the efficiency of offline evolution. During this offline collection phase, ground truth is used only to assist attribution decisions through the optional oracle prompt listed in Appendix G.4; it is not exposed to the solver and is not written directly into the evolved skills. After collecting offline experience, we transfer the resulting frozen skill library to all 89 Terminal-Bench 2.0 tasks for recommendation only. We repeat this transfer evaluation 5 times and report avg@5 Accuracy.

Curated skill transfer. We also run an offline setting that starts from a curated skill library. This library contains approximately 10k curated skills selected from open-source skills through the SkillsVote collection and profiling pipeline. The selected skills pass format validation, deduplication, and quality analysis, and are further restricted to skills sourced from GitHub repositories with more than 1k stars. This setting performs recommendation only, with no evolution. We transfer the curated library directly to all 89 Terminal-Bench 2.0 tasks, run each task 5 times independently, and report avg@5 Accuracy.

Online skill evolution. Online evolution starts from an empty skill library with task-level recommendation and evolution enabled. Tasks follow the default Terminal-Bench 2.0 order, and one sequential pass over all 89 tasks forms one job. We run 5 jobs independently and report avg@5 Accuracy. Skill libraries are fully isolated across jobs.

Baselines. (1) The w/o skills baseline removes the experience library and all additional mechanisms, leaving only the solver agent to act in the container; it is also evaluated over 5 runs and reported as avg@5 Accuracy. (2) For ReasoningBank, we reproduce the open-source method under the same timeout and retry settings. Retries do not update memory; following ReasoningBank’s original protocol, memory is updated only after a task reaches final success or final failure. We use the same online protocol as above, with 5 independent jobs and isolated memory banks. We disable memory-aware test-time scaling (MaTTS), which curates memory by jointly synthesizing multiple scaled trajectories via self-contrast or self-refinement; to align with the SkillsVote evaluation protocol, we use a single rollout per task. (3) For skill-creator, we replace SkillsVote’s attribution-guided evolution with a single prompt that instructs the agent to use the skill-creator skill for post-task evolution from the completed trajectory. We use OpenAI’s version of

skill-creator1, which is better aligned with Codex CLI. We use the same online protocol, timeout and retry settings as above, with 5 independent jobs and isolated skill libraries.

#### C.3 SWE-Bench Pro

Dataset. The public split of SWE-Bench Pro contains 731 long-horizon software engineering tasks from

- 11 public GPL repositories, each verified and augmented by humans [10]. These repositories span business applications, B2B services, and developer tools. In the released dataset, the 11 repositories fall into four language groups: Go contributes 280 tasks from flipt-io/flipt, future-architect/vuls, gravitational/teleport, and navidrome/navidrome; Python contributes 266 tasks from ansible/ansible, internetarchive/openlibrary, and qutebrowser/qutebrowser; JavaScript contributes 165 tasks from NodeBB/NodeBB, element-hq/element-web, and protonmail/webclients; TypeScript contributes 20 tasks from tutao/tutanota.

Configuration. We use exactly the same retry mechanism and timeout multipliers as in Terminal-Bench 2.0.

Evaluation metric. We report avg@1 Resolve Rate. Resolve Rate indicates whether the single rollout for a task produces a patch that passes the verifier; because each task is run once, avg@1 is simply the average solve rate across tasks.

Curated skill transfer. The offline setting matches the same offline setting used on Terminal-Bench 2.0. It starts from the same curated skill library of approximately 10k skills selected by the SkillsVote collection and profiling pipeline, after format validation, deduplication, quality analysis, and filtering to skills sourced from GitHub repositories with more than 1k stars. This setting performs recommendation only, with no evolution. We evaluate all 731 public tasks once and report avg@1 Resolve Rate.

Online skill evolution. Online evolution starts from an empty skill library with task-level recommendation and evolution enabled. Instead of treating the entire benchmark as one stream, we order tasks by repository and run each repository as an independent job. This yields 11 jobs, one per repository, which improves evaluation efficiency and better reflects experience reuse within a single codebase. We execute all repositories once and report overall avg@1 Resolve Rate across the 731 tasks. Skill libraries do not carry across repositories.

Baselines. (1) The w/o skills baseline runs once on the public split and reports avg@1 Resolve Rate. (2) For ReasoningBank, we use the same timeout and retry settings as above. Settings for memory updating matches the settings used on Terminal-Bench 2.0. We follow the same repository-level online protocol as above, so each repository job evolves its memory bank independently. (3) For skill-creator, we use the same timeout, retry settings, and repository-level online protocol as above. Settings for skill evolution with skill-creator matches the settings used on Terminal-Bench 2.0.

## D Approach Details

- D.1 Open-Source Skill Corpus and Profiling

- D.1.1 Collecting a Million-Scale Agent Skill Corpus

Open Agent Skill ecosystems have reached marketplace scale. SkillsMP [54] and skills.sh [57] aggregate GitHub SKILL.md packages and expose search, categories, popularity, and installation-based discovery signals. Yet discovery metadata is not execution evidence: names, descriptions, and popularity do not reveal runtime fit, resource completeness, coherent scope, or objective checkability. Recent benchmarks likewise show that skill utility depends on the task, domain, and corpus quality [23, 75]. SkillsVote therefore collects a million-scale corpus from GitHub and treats each skill as a directory-level artifact, preserving SKILL.md plus optional scripts/, references/, and assets/ as the governance unit. Appendix E.1 details validation and deduplication.

1https://github.com/openai/skills/tree/4ab6e0fd99c6667163bc34173e3ed3a3fed75ebc/skills/.system/skill-creator

##### D.1.2 Profiling Skill Requirements, Quality, and Verifiability

SkillsVote turns this raw corpus into execution-ready artifacts through three profiles. The runtime profile captures operating-system assumptions, write scope, privilege, externality, credentials, CLIs, MCP servers, and environment variables. The quality profile checks consistency, completeness, and task orientation. The verifiability profile checks low-ambiguity success conditions, sandbox-controllable environments, and task construction cost. Prior ecosystem-level systems emphasize skill organization, multidimensional evaluation, and cross-harness portability [8, 22, 26]; SkillsVote instantiates these concerns as operational gates for recommendation and task synthesis. Appendix D.3 defines the profiling schemas and rubrics, and Appendix A.1 reports corpus-level profiling statistics.

##### D.1.3 Synthesizing Verifiable Tasks from Agent Skills

For skills passing verifiability, SkillsVote synthesizes Harbor-format tasks from the skill itself [16]. Each task contains a clear instruction, reproducible environment, and executable verifier; real agent–model runs then record success rates, costs, traces, and verifier outcomes. This links static skill descriptions to observed behavior while leaving preference-driven, open-world, or hardware-intensive skills as profiled corpus items rather than forced executable task instances.

#### D.2 Prompt Rendering Rules

Profiling. The profiling stage uses a profiling system prompt and a profiling user prompt, listed in Appendix G.1. The system prompt defines the expected skill directory tree, the category assignment protocol, the runtime-requirements analysis protocol, the quality rubric, the verifiability rubric, the selection policy, and the output constraints. The user prompt only provides the root of the target skill. This separation keeps profiling tied to the local skill package itself, while keeping the schema and decision rules stable across skills.

Recommendation. The recommendation stage uses a recommendation system prompt and a recommendation

- user prompt, listed in Appendix G.2. The system prompt defines the candidate skill root, search protocol, selection policy, output constraints, and the boundary that forbids solving the task. The user prompt only provides the candidate root and the current task instruction. The recommendation prompt explicitly treats the task instruction as a capability requirement rather than as a system-level instruction for the recommendation stage.

Attribution. The post-execution attribution stage continues the dialogue by resuming the original solver agent session. It therefore does not replace the original system prompt, and only appends a user prompt listed in Appendix G.4. This prompt contains the currently accessible skills, the current working path, and verifier signals. Online evolution mode only provides task-level final counts. Offline evolution mode additionally provides paths to the solution, verifier tests, and verifier stdout to help judge subtasks, but still forbids standard answers, private constants, one-off paths, and other benchmark-specific content from being distilled into reusable exploration.

Evolution. The evolution stage first constructs create requests and edit requests from attribution results, and then renders the corresponding evolution prompts listed in Appendix G.5. Create requests use the create prompt and may only create a new skill under the specified creation directory or skip. Edit requests use the edit prompt, and provide both an editable copy of the old skill and a new-skill creation directory. This allows local edits to the old skill, or new skill creation when the exploration exceeds the old skill boundary.

#### D.3 Schema of Profiling Artifacts

- • SkillEnvironmentRubric: the runtime-requirement profile of a skill. It records supported operating systems through os, the allowed write boundary through write_scope using the levels in Table 6, privilege assumptions through privilege, external dependency level through externality using the levels in Table 7, required environment variables through envs, command-line tools through bins, MCP servers through mcps, and an evidence explanation through reason.

- • SkillQualityRubric: the quality rubric supplied to the profiling agent. It contains the three rubric dimensions consistency, completeness, and orientation, defined in Table 8, each paired with a free-text reason.
- • SkillVerifiabilityRubric: the verifiability rubric supplied to the profiling agent. It contains success_verifiability, environment_controllability, and task_constructability, defined in Table 9, each paired with a free-text reason.
- • SkillEvaluationRubric: the flattened rubric rendered into the profiling prompt. It combines runtimerequirement fields, quality fields, verifiability fields, category labels from Table 10, and category rationale into one schema so that the prompt exposes all decision criteria together.

#### D.4 Schema of Recommendation Artifacts

- • skill_names (list[str]): the list of skill names recommended to the solver agent. Each name must exactly correspond to a real skill directory under the candidate skill root, and duplicates are not allowed. An empty list is allowed only after effective search confirms that no relevant reusable skill exists.
- • optimized_context (str): concise skill-use guidance for the solver agent. It should explain which task stage each selected skill covers, how the skills should be combined, obvious coverage gaps, and usage boundaries. It must not directly complete the task, output the final answer, repeat the search trace, or copy long skill content.

#### D.5 Schema of Attribution Artifacts

- • subtasks (list[Subtask]): the list of subtasks extracted from this trajectory, containing at least one element.
- • goal (str): the independent objective of the subtask.
- • summary (str): the factual summary of the subtask.
- • exploration (str | null): reusable exploration produced in the subtask; null if there is no reusable content worth retaining.
- • exploration_reason (str): the explanation for exploration.
- • judge (enum): the primary judgment signal type used by the subtask, with values shown in Table 11.
- • judge_reason (str): the evidence explanation for selecting this judge type.
- • attribution (enum): the final result and main-cause category of the subtask, with values shown in Table 12.
- • attribution_reason (str): the evidence explanation for selecting this attribution.
- • skill_linked (str | null): the single skill name associated with the subtask.
- • skill_refs (list[SkillRef]): the skill text spans actually relied on by the subtask.

- Table 6 Write-scope levels used by the profiling stage. The value records how far a skill is expected to write beyond reading its inputs.

Write Scope Meaning

read The skill only needs to inspect files, metadata, or external outputs. workspace The skill writes within the task workspace or another user-controlled project

directory. system The skill may modify system-level state, such as packages, services, ports, or privileged configuration files.

- Table 7 Externality levels used by the profiling stage. The value records whether executing the skill depends on networked or authenticated resources.

Externality Meaning

offline The skill can run without network access or live third-party services. online The skill may need public network access or unauthenticated live services. secured The skill depends on credentials, API keys, logged-in sessions, or private services.

- Table 8 Quality rubric used during skill profiling. These dimensions decide whether a skill is a stable execution unit before it is used for recommendation.

Criterion Positive Evidence Negative Evidence

consistency The skill name, description, instructions, scripts, and referenced resources describe the same capability and compatible assumptions.

The package mixes unrelated goals, contradicts itself, or points to resources that imply a different task.

completeness The skill provides enough steps, prerequisites, resources, and expected outputs for an agent to execute the capability.

Critical setup, commands, files, inputs, or success conditions are missing.

orientation The content is written as reusable taskexecution guidance for an agent.

The content is mainly background prose, marketing text, a one-off answer, or generic advice without actionable procedure.

- Table 9 Verifiability rubric used during skill profiling. A skill passes this profile only when it can support reproducible task construction and objective checking at reasonable cost.

Criterion Positive Evidence Negative Evidence

success_verifiability The skill has observable outputs, tests, files, service states, or metrics that can determine success with low ambiguity.

Success depends mainly on subjective preference, hidden state, vague quality judgments, or manual interpretation.

environment_controllability The required runtime, tools, services, data, and permissions can be reproduced in a sandbox or benchmark container.

The skill depends on unavailable hardware, unstable external services, private accounts, or uncontrolled live state.

task_constructability Concrete task instances, inputs, expected outputs, and verifiers can be created from the skill at reasonable cost.

The skill is too open-ended, too broad, or too expensive to convert into bounded benchmark tasks.

- • skill_refs[].file_path (str): the relative path of the referenced file inside the skill directory.
- • skill_refs[].start_line (int | null): the 1-based starting line number of the referenced knowledge span.
- • skill_refs[].end_line (int | null): the 1-based ending line number of the referenced knowledge span.
- • skill_refs[].capability (str): the capability, instruction, or knowledge summary expressed by the referenced span.

- Table 12 Attribution categories produced for each subtask. Successful categories can trigger skill creation or update, while failed and uncertain categories are skipped during skill evolution.

Attribution Type Meaning Evolution Type

success_viewed_skill_but_ not_used

The agent viewed a skill, but the skill did not materially shape the successful path.

Create

success_no_skill_seen The agent did not view a skill and still completed the subtask through independent exploration.

Create

success_skill_used_with_ extra_exploration

The agent genuinely relied on a skill, performed extra exploration, and succeeded.

Edit or Create

fail_skill_issue The main failure cause lies in the skill itself. Skip fail_agent_limit The main failure cause lies in the agent. Skip fail_client_env The main failure cause lies in the client-side environment. Skip fail_external_env The main failure cause lies in external systems or services. Skip fail_unknown_env The subtask clearly failed because of the environment, but the

evidence cannot distinguish the client environment from the external environment.

Skip

uncertain_human_judge_ required

Human judgment is required but currently unavailable. Skip

uncertain_environment_judge_ inconclusive

Environment signals exist but are insufficient for complete judgment.

Skip

uncertain_no_judge No clear judgment signal exists and the goal is not self-evident enough.

Skip

- Table 13 Evolution action types and corresponding operations. Each action describes how reusable exploration is evolved, ranging from editing an existing skill to creating a new skill or skip.

Evolution Action Type Meaning Skill Operation

error_fix Correct clearly wrong or misleading guidance in an old skill. Edit knowledge_addition Add missing reusable steps, branches, or fallback guidance to an

Edit

old skill.

prerequisite_addition Add prerequisites, applicability boundaries, warnings, or guardrails.

Edit

create_skill Create a new independent skill. Create skip Do not update. Skip

#### D.7 Aggregation of Subtasks

Before evolution, the system first merges all subtasks payloads in a batch, and then checks the subtasks one by one. A subtask enters evolution only when it satisfies two conditions:

- • exploration is nonempty, because we only evolve explorations performed by the agent into skills.
- • attribution belongs to the three successful exploration categories in Table 12. Failed and uncertain subtasks do not trigger library updates.

After aggregation, successful exploration without an editable linked skill is placed into a create request. For the attribution value success_skill_used_with_extra_exploration, successful exploration with a nonempty

skill_linked is grouped by linked skill into multiple edit requests. Each edit request corresponds to exactly one old skill.

## E Implementation Details

#### E.1 Skill Corpus Validation and Profiling

SkillsVote validates, deduplicates, and profiles collected Agent Skills before they enter recommendation or benchmark task synthesis. The profiling process produces three structured views for each accepted skill package: a runtime-requirement profile, a quality profile, and a verifiability profile.

Format validation. SkillsVote first checks whether a collected candidate is a valid Agent Skill package. We use Anthropic’s official skill validation script2 to validate the required SKILL.md format and package structure, and discards malformed candidates before downstream indexing.

Deduplication. SkillsVote then removes duplicates among candidates whose SKILL.md files contain exactly the same content. For each duplicate group, the system keeps the copy with the earliest GitHub commit timestamp and treats later copies as duplicates. This preserves the earliest observed source while removing redundant packages from the searchable corpus.

Agentic Skill Profiling. For each remaining skill directory, SkillsVote launches Claude Code through the Claude Agent SDK3 with the skill directory as the working scope. We use a Claude Code agent rather than a single-document LLM call because the profiler can inspect the complete skill package, including scripts, references, assets, and auxiliary files, instead of relying only on SKILL.md. This exposes dependencies, applicability boundaries, and missing resources that are often distributed across the directory. The Claude Code process receives only Grep, Glob, Read, and StructuredOutput tools. The final StructuredOutput payload is parsed into the skill profiles described in Appendix D.

#### E.2 Lifecycle of Harbor Evaluation Framework

SkillsVote implements benchmark evaluation based on Harbor by integrating Skill Recommendation, Subtask Distillation, and Skill Evolution into the Harbor workflow.

A Harbor job first parses the task collection and expands each task instance into a trial. The main lifecycle of a trial includes creating the trial working directory, starting the task container, running agent setup, passing the instruction to the solver agent, downloading agent logs and sessions, running the verifier, stopping the container, recording the final trial result, and triggering the trial-end hook.

This order determines the following implementation logic of SkillsVote:

- • The recommendation stage must run before the solver agent starts, because it controls which skills are installed into the agent-visible directory and appends compressed skill-use guidance to the task instruction.
- • Attribution and skill evolution must run after the trial ends, because they depend on the complete agent session and verifier result. At that point, the task container has already stopped, so both stages run on the host side.

SkillsVote implements the above mechanism using the trial lifecycle hook exposed by Harbor. When the trial-end hook is triggered, it can already access the trial result, agent artifacts, and verifier artifacts, which match the inputs required by attribution and evolution. If a failed trial will still be retried by Harbor itself, SkillsVote skips attribution and evolution for that attempt and waits until the final attempt finishes, avoiding duplicate writes of intermediate failures into the experience library.

scripts/quick_validate.py

- 3https://github.com/anthropics/claude-agent-sdk-python

The task-solving process of the solver agent keeps Harbor’s original logic, including execution and verifying. SkillsVote only changes the preparation stage before task execution and the attribution stage after task execution, without modifying the solver agent’s task-solving workflow.

#### E.3 Dataset Preparation and Environment Setup

When using Harbor’s official dataset images, each trial dynamically installs the agent CLI during setup by default. This creates substantial network I/O in concurrent runs and limits the throughput of large experiment batches. To improve experimental efficiency, SkillsVote therefore prebuilds experiment images with the agent CLI on top of the original task images and skips repeated installation at runtime.

The prebuild process first downloads the Harbor dataset, reads the image definition for each task, builds a new image with a preinstalled agent from the original task image as the base image, and uses the built image in the task configuration. The prebuilt image fixes nvm 0.40.4, Node.js 22, and Codex CLI 0.125.0. This approach reduces repeated downloads in concurrent experiments and shortens the trial preparation time.

#### E.4 Experiment Configuration and Orchestration

SkillsVote provides a lightweight launcher outside Harbor. The launcher uses YAML to manage both native Harbor configuration and SkillsVote-specific extended configuration, registers different modules, and makes experimental setup convenient.

This design allows baselines, recommendation, online evolution, and offline evolution to share the same launcher. Different experiments only need to change YAML, without modifying Harbor code or copying multiple execution scripts.

#### E.5 Integration of Solver Agent

We implement our solver agent based on the Codex integration provided by Harbor, but do not modify its task execution logic. We only modify the preparation work before trial execution. Because the image already preinstalls Codex 0.125.0, agent setup no longer installs the CLI and only creates the necessary agent directories. During formal execution, Codex still runs the task instruction in execution mode, with JSON logging and the unified terminal execution tool enabled so that Harbor can download the session and execution status.

Codex’s built-in system skills and plugins may inject extra prompt content, interfering with the measurement of the SkillsVote skill library. The system first initializes the agent home so that Codex discovers system skills and plugins; it then generates the agent configuration according to the experiment setting and marks system skills and plugins as disabled.

#### E.6 Integration of Skill Recommendation

The goal of the recommendation stage is to select a small set of skills that are most relevant to the task and least redundant before the solver agent executes. The agent itself does not solve the task; it only searches the candidate skill library, reads candidate skill documents and resources, and generates skill usage guidance for the solver agent.

- 1. The candidate skill library is mounted into the task container through Harbor as a read-only directory. The agent’s cwd is set to the candidate skill root, not the benchmark task workspace.
- 2. An isolated recommendation environment is created. The recommendation stage uses a temporary agent home and a temporary output directory. System skills and plugins are disabled in the same controlled way as for the solver, and the candidate skill root is used only as the trusted directory for recommendation.
- 3. The recommendation prompt is rendered and executed. The recommendation stage reuses the solver agent’s model and CLI parameters and runs with bypass permissions.

- 4. The recommendation stage writes the JSON schema, structured output file, command log, and recommendation session. The structured output is parsed and validated; if the output is missing or malformed, it is retried up to three times. Logs, intermediate outputs, final outputs, and the recommendation session are downloaded to the host trial directory.
- 5. If recommendation succeeds and returns a nonempty skill-name list, the system copies only those skill directories into the solver agent’s skill directory, and the concise usage guidance generated by the agent is appended to the end of the task instruction as the solver agent’s skill usage context. If the recommendation stage repeatedly fails to produce valid output, or if installing the selected skills fails, the system records the error and falls back to copying all candidate skills, allowing the benchmark trial to continue.
- 6. After recommendation ends, the temporary recommendation directory, temporary agent home, and temporary credential files inside the container are cleaned up.

#### E.7 Integration of Task Attribution

This stage turns a complete agent trajectory and verifier result into structured subtasks. It does not simply compress the original session into text; instead, it resumes the original Codex session so that the agent continues reasoning inside the native agent harness context. This prevents loss of contextual details, and because commercial models often encrypt chain-of-thought, the resume mechanism is the only way to avoid discarding that context.

- 1. When the trial-end hook is triggered, Harbor has already downloaded agent artifacts, run the verifier, and stopped the task container. The host-side session and verifier artifacts can therefore be obtained.
- 2. An isolated working path and a new agent home are created for each trial. The original solver agent session, visible skills, and related artifacts are copied.
- 3. Because each trial is expected to produce exactly one agent session file, the system reads the session id needed for resume from that session file and runs Codex resume with the isolated working path and agent home to restore the context at that time. The prompt is appended as a new user prompt through standard input; resume does not replace the original system prompt, preserving native session context management.
- 4. Verifier evidence is provided in a controlled way, mainly in two modes:

- • Online mode provides only task-level test counts, including the total, passed, and failed counts. These counts can come from CTRF reports, pytest summaries, benchmark-specific JSON, or Harbor reward.
- • Offline oracle mode can additionally expose paths to the solution, verifier tests, and verifier stdout, but the prompt still forbids writing gold answers, private constants, canary strings, one-off paths, or exact ground-truth outputs into reusable exploration.

- 5. The output is validated and the resumed session is archived. The attribution stage uses a structured schema and writes the last message to a JSON output file. Missing output, malformed output, runtime timeout, or missing resumed session artifacts are treated as retryable output errors and are retried up to three times. After validation passes, artifacts are retained.

#### E.8 Integration of Skill Evolution

The evolution stage runs after attribution stage, and it only consumes structured subtasks. The system

- uses a unified local agent home to store credentials and agent sessions, while each evolution request has an independent working directory to isolate the read/write scope.

1. Subtasks are aggregated and evolution requests are constructed. Subtask payloads in the same batch are merged into one subtask list, with three aggregation rules:

Figure 12 Representative offline-transfer case. A skill evolved from an Apache website task transfers persistent-service setup and end-to-end validation to an unseen Git-server deployment task.

- • Subtasks without reusable exploration are filtered out; failed and uncertain attributions are filtered out; only successful exploration can trigger skill-library updates.
- • Successful exploration without an editable linked skill enters a create request.
- • Successful extra exploration associated with an existing skill is grouped by skill name, and each target skill forms an independent edit request.

- 2. Each evolution run creates a new local run directory and a temporary schema/output area.

- • A create request uses the request directory as the root where new skills are allowed to be created.
- • An edit request copies the target skill into a request-local editable directory and also provides an independent creation directory for the agent to create a skill when necessary.
- • Before editing an old skill, the system backs up the current version in the runtime skill library using the batch timestamp.

- 3. Create requests use the create system prompt and create user prompt, and edit requests use the edit system prompt and edit user prompt; Appendix G.5 lists all four prompts.
- 4. The evolution run uses a structured schema and writes the final JSON output. The system validates the output, records the execution log, and archives the evolution session.

## F Case Study

#### F.1 Offline Skill Transfer from TB-Pro to Terminal-Bench 2.0

As shown in Figure 12, this group of cases provides a representative example of what is transferred by offline evolution. The source trajectories implement Apache-backed websites and contribute reusable knowledge about persistent Apache configuration, service installation, and end-to-end runtime validation. These lessons are distilled into the ubuntu-apache-vhost skill rather than stored as raw trajectories.

On the unseen configure-git-webserver task, the evolved run does not copy the source solution. Instead, it reuses the operational pattern: deploy the web endpoint with a stable Apache service, connect the Git post-receive hook to the served directory, and validate the full path by requesting the final URL. The baseline run builds a bare repository and a lightweight Node server, but it lacks persistent service setup and final runtime validation. The case illustrates the type of transfer that SkillsVote is designed to preserve: not task-specific constants or answers, but reusable execution invariants that improve reliability on a different task.

This case shows the creation of the ubuntu-apache-vhost skill when running offline evolution on the task of Terminal-Bench Pro. During task execution, the agent persists configuration parameters through Apache configuration files, configures the web root, and validates both the configuration and site availability. These exploratory steps are extracted into subtasks, and reusable knowledge such as service startup and runtime validation is converted into a skill.

Creation of skill from configure-apache-logging-and-rate-limit

Task Instruction Configure an Apache web server environment to serve content with comprehensive logging and rate limiting.

- • Apache2: installed and available via `apache2ctl`.
- • Port: listen on port `9090`.
- • Document Root: serve static content from `/srv/www/content`.
- • Log Format: include timestamps, HTTP methods, status codes, response sizes, and referrers.

The task requires a `*:9090` virtual host with `ServerName localhost`, detailed access and error logs under `/var/log/apache2`, a maximum of 20 concurrent connections per IP, a custom `/403.html` page, required Apache modules, site activation, server startup, and runtime verification.

- Subtask 2

- • goal: Implement persistent Apache configuration for port `9090`, custom logging, and per-IP connection limiting.
- • exploration: For Apache concurrency limits, `mod_qos` provides `QS_SrvMaxConnPerIP`, which is practical when the stock module set only includes `mod_ratelimit` for bandwidth throttling rather than true connection concurrency control.
- • attribution: `success_no_skill_seen`

###### Subtask 3

- • goal: Start Apache and verify the server responds correctly on port `9090` with the expected logging and 403 behavior.
- • exploration: A reliable Apache 403 test is easier to validate by denying a real directory under the document root than by relying on a nonexistent path or rewrite rule.
- • attribution: `success_no_skill_seen`

Skill Evolution [create] ubuntu-apache-vhost

- - Configure persistent Apache vhosts on Ubuntu or Debian, including ports, logs, access control, and validation.
- - Put global listeners in `ports.conf`, site-specific settings in `sites-available`, enable the site, and validate with `apache2ctl -t` before restart or reload.
- - Use `Listen` for persistent port bindings, keep the virtual host on the matching `*:PORT` stanza, and define explicit `DocumentRoot` and log paths.
- - For custom 403 behavior, serve `/403.html` from the document root and deny a real directory when a runtime 403 test is needed.
- - For true per-IP connection limits, use `mod_qos` and `QS_SrvMaxConnPerIP` when the stock module set is insufficient.

This case shows the editing of the ubuntu-apache-vhost skill when running offline evolution on the task of Terminal-Bench Pro. During task execution, the agent follows the skill to launch an Apache service, discovers that systemctl is unavailable, and falls back to the service command. These explorations are extracted into subtasks, and the evolution step updates the skill with a fallback strategy for system service installation while strengthening its runtime validation procedure.

Editing of skill from configure-apache-analytics-virtualhost

Task Instruction Configure Apache2 to implement custom port listening and advanced access log recording.

- 1. Create `analytics-site.conf` under `/etc/apache2/sites-available/`, using `<VirtualHost

*:9090>`, `ServerName localhost`, and `DocumentRoot /var/www/content`.

- 2. Configure `/var/log/apache2/traffic-access.log` with the format `%t %m %s %{Referer}i [%a]`.
- 3. Configure `/var/www/content` with `Options Indexes FollowSymLinks`, `AllowOverride None`, and `Require all granted`.
- 4. Add `Listen 9090` at the end of the configuration file.
- 5. Enable the site with `a2ensite analytics-site.conf`.

This case shows the skill transfers to unseen task of Terminal-Bench 2.0, with recommendation enabled. The ubuntu-apache-vhost skill is recommended for persistent HTTP serving and runtime validation. During problem solving, the agent reuses this operational pattern by launching the HTTP endpoint through Apache, installing it as a system service via the service command, and repeatedly validating the service both during intermediate steps and at the end of the task. This demonstrates that the skill captures reusable operational knowledge rather than a task-specific answer, and that such knowledge can transfer successfully to an unseen task.

Transfer of skill to configure-git-webserver

- • `echo "hello world" > hello.html`
- • `git add hello.html`
- • `git commit -m "add hello.html"`
- • `git push origin master`

The pushed data should be served by a webserver on port `8080`; `curl http://server:8080/hello.html` should return `hello world`. Login setup is assumed to be handled externally.

#### F.2 Online Evolution on SWE-Bench Pro

This case shows the online evolution run on the NodeBB task of SWE-Bench Pro, in which multiple recommended skills support different parts of the repair. Route wiring, authenticated reproduction, Redis bootstrap, and API error serialization are separated into distinct attributed subtasks, and only the reusable successful parts are eligible for editing skills.

##### Online evolution run on nodebb-invite-api

Task Instruction Lack of API Support for Managing Group Invitations Limits Extensibility

Group invitation logic for issuing, accepting, and rejecting invitations is handled through socket events and the web layer. The task requires authenticated HTTP API endpoints so external clients can issue, accept, and reject or rescind group invitations.

- • Issue invite: `POST /groups/{slug}/invites/{uid}` lets a group owner or admin issue an invitation and

- log `group-invite`.
- • Accept invite: `PUT /groups/{slug}/invites/{uid}` lets the invited user accept their own invite. If `uid` differs from the caller, return `[[error:not-allowed]]`; if no invite exists, return `[[error:not-invited]]`; log `group-invite-accept`.
- • Reject or rescind invite: `DELETE /groups/{slug}/invites/{uid}` lets the invited user reject or an owner/admin rescind an invite, with `[[error:not-invited]]` or `[[error:not-allowed]]` on invalid cases. Rejection by the invited user logs `group-invite-reject`.

The implementation should add exported functions `issueInvite`, `acceptInvite`, and `rejectInvite` in `src/api/groups.js`, add controllers in `src/controllers/write/groups.js`, and update the web client and OpenAPI specification.

Distilled Subtasks

- Subtask 1

- • goal: Locate the existing group invitation implementation and identify where to add equivalent authenticated HTTP endpoints.
- • summary: The agent found group invite logic in the socket and group-invite modules, then mapped the v3 write route, controller, and API modules that needed to be extended. It confirmed invite HTTP routes were missing or commented out and that OpenAPI only documented `GET /groups/{slug}/invites`.
- • attribution: `success_no_skill_seen`

- Subtask 2

- • goal: Create an executable end-to-end repro that boots NodeBB with the test database mock and exercises the new invite HTTP routes.
- • summary: The agent created `scripts/repro-group-invite-write-api.js`, booted through `test/mocks/databasemock`, created users and a private group, logged in to obtain authenticated jars, and issued HTTP `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` requests against `/api/v3/groups/:slug/invites/:u id`. The initial run failed with Redis `ECONNREFUSED`; after starting Redis, the repro confirmed the pre-implementation 404.
- • exploration: For NodeBB end-to-end repros, use a Mocha script requiring `test/mocks/databasemock`, use `test/helpers` for login and CSRF handling, then exercise HTTP routes; if bootstrap fails with Redis `ECONNREFUSED`, start local Redis on that host and port before rerunning.

- - Reuse existing helper utilities for authenticated HTTP requests instead of re-implementing login flows.
- - Load helper modules after bootstrap.
- - Use helper HTTP clients and login utilities to obtain an authenticated cookie jar or session.
- - Prefer helper request wrappers for CSRF and cookies; if helpers are not used, fetch CSRF from `/api/config` and send it as `x-csrf-token`.

- Subtask 3

- • goal: Implement authenticated v3 write API endpoints to issue, accept, and reject or rescind group invitations using `slug` and `uid` path parameters.

- • summary: The agent implemented `groupsAPI.issueInvite`, `groupsAPI.acceptInvite`, and `groupsAPI.rejectInvite` in `src/api/groups.js` with permission checks and event logging, then added controllers and routes for `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` at `/api/v3/groups/:slug/invites/:uid`.
- • attribution: `success_no_skill_seen`

###### Subtask 4

- • goal: Update the web client and OpenAPI write specification to reflect and use the new invite management routes.
- • summary: The agent updated the group-details client to use the v3 API module for invite issue, accept, reject, and rescind actions, and added OpenAPI path/spec files for `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` on `/groups/{ slug}/invites/{uid}`.
- • attribution: `uncertain_no_judge`

###### Subtask 5

- • goal: Ensure invite endpoint errors return correct HTTP statuses and preserve canonical error keys in API responses.
- • summary: The agent observed a repro failure where `[[error:not-allowed]]` surfaced with HTTP `400` and a translated `not-allowed` message. It adjusted `src/controllers/helpers.js` to map `[[error:not-allowed]]` and `[[error:not-invited]]` to HTTP `403` and preserve untranslated keys for `/api/v3`; the repro then passed.
- • exploration: When write API tests require exact error keys, avoid automatic translation in the `/api/v3` serializer and map common permission-related keys to `403`; otherwise callers may see translated strings and inconsistent status codes.
- • attribution: `success_no_skill_seen`

###### Subtask 6

- • goal: Achieve full private test suite compliance for the implemented invite API changes without regressing unrelated API behavior.
- • summary: The local repro passed, but the verifier reported `421/427` private tests passing with six failures remaining, suggesting incomplete edge-case handling or regressions around global API status/translation behavior or permission semantics.

## G Prompts

#### G.1 Skill Profiling

The profiling stage evaluates one skill directory at a time. The system prompt requests inspection of the skill’s instructions and supporting files, with a structured report covering runtime requirements, quality signals, and suitability for automatically verifiable tasks. A skill root is the directory that contains the target SKILL.md and any scripts, references, or assets that belong to that skill. Runtime placeholders are kept literal in the templates below.

##### System Prompt

- 1 Evaluate an agent skill directory:
- 2 skill-name/
- 3 SKILL.md # Required: instructions + metadata

- 4 scripts/ # Optional: executable code

- 5 references/ # Optional: documentation

- 6 assets/ # Optional: templates, resources

- 7
- 8 ## Task 1: Environment Analysis
- 9 All environment tags describe the runtime required by the agent while executing the skill itself, not the environment of generated outputs, deployed artifacts, or downstream user code. Here are the environment tags:
- 10 - `os`: OS families expected to work on.
- 11 - `write_scope`: Maximum expected write/side-effect scope when running the skill as intended. Return:
- 12 - `read`: no file writes.
- 13 - `workspace`: write only inside the workspace or a dedicated output directory; does not change system settings, services, installed software, or other machine-wide state
- 14 - `system`: writes outside the workspace or dedicated directory, or changes system settings, services, installed software, running processes, or other machine-wide state
- 15 - `privilege`: Whether the skill requires elevated privileges.
- 16 - `externality`: External dependency level. Return:
- 17 - `offline`: no network or external account dependency is part of the
- 18 core skill workflow
- 19 - `online`: network access is part of the core workflow, but no secrets or
- 20 privileged account are required. Do not treat incidental dependency installation or one-time setup as `online` unless fetching/deployment/network interaction is itself part of the main skill.
- 21 - `secured`: secrets, authenticated accounts, or protected services are required as part of the core workflow
- 22 - `envs`: Environment variable names referenced or required. Never include
- 23 values.
- 24 - `bins`: Top-level executable command names required/used (canonicalized, lowercase, unversioned). Exclude package names such as `torch`, `nextjs`, etc., unless they are also invoked as standalone executables. Exclude shell builtins and basic OS utilities (e.g., `cp`, `open`, `nohup`, `kill`, and `bash`).
- 25 - `mcps`: MCP server identifiers required/used (canonicalized, unversioned).
- 26 - `environment_reason`: 3-5 sentences evidence-based justification for the environment tags.
- 27
- 28 ## Task 2: Quality Evalation

- 29 Here is the rubric:
- 30 - `consistency`: Check whether the skill clearly expresses one stable purpose and whether the rest of the skill consistently serves that purpose. E.g. coding style objective, a tool operation workflow, a PR-writing method, or another reusable task pattern, but it should be identifiable from the skill itself. Return:
- 31 - `true` : the skill makes a single reusable purpose identifiable from its title, description, instructions, examples, or referenced materials, and the rest of the skill consistently supports that same purpose, method, or operating scope without material conflict.
- 32 - `false`: the skill's core purpose remains hard to identify after reading it, or when its instructions, examples, rules, or references materially diverge from, mix with, or undermine that purpose
- 33 - `completeness`: Whether referenced files, scripts, assets, templates, and resources exist, necessary dependencies are discoverable from the skill artifact, and the documented usage path is followable as written. Warning: If a skill itself doesn't require executable scripts, referenced files, or dependencies, it shouldn't be false merely for "not having those things." Return:
- 34 - `true`: According to the usage path used in SKILL.md, all referenced files, scripts, templates, assets, and resources actually exist && any necessary dependency declared in skill workflow must be discoverable from the skill directory.
- 35 - `false`: SKILL.md points to a missing required artifact | The skill workflow appears to depend on something necessary that is neither declared nor discoverable | Cannot be followed as written because a required referenced artifact is absent.
- 36 - `orientation`: Whether the skill helps complete tasks through actionable guidance, decision rules, checks, or lookup paths. A reference-heavy skill can still be true if it clearly supports task-oriented use. Return:
- 37 - `true`: the skill gives actionable guidance that helps complete the task, such as concrete steps, checks, decision rules, lookup paths, or execution guidance && any reference material is clearly connected to what the user should do
- 38 - `false`: when the skill is mainly descriptive, archival, or reference-heavy without explaining how the material should be used to complete the task, so that a user would still have no idea what to do next after reading it
- 39
- 40 ## Task 3: Verifiability Evaluation
- 41 Evaluate whether a skill is suitable for benchmark tasks with automatic verification. Skills that pass this screening will be used in the next stage to generate concrete tasks and Docker-based sandbox environments using large language models. Here is the rubric:
- 42 - `success_verifiability`: Whether success can be judged programmatically with low ambiguity from the final artifact, execution result, or resulting environment state. Return:
- 43 - `true`: If success can be checked with a reliable verifier such as exact match, schema/constraint validation, unit/integration tests, query result checks, file diff checks, compiler/runtime checks, or API/DB/DOM state assertions.
- 44 - `false`: If success is mainly subjective, preference-based, open-ended, or relies primarily on human/LLM judgment. Approximate proxy metrics alone (e.g. similarity scores, ROUGE/BLEU, style preference) do NOT count as strong verification.
- 45 - `null`: If the skill is underspecified or too broad to determine whether a low-ambiguity verifier exists.

- 46 - `environment_controllability`: Whether a representative task environment for this skill can be instantiated, reset, and executed inside a Docker-based sandbox generated from a textual specification (e.g. Dockerfile plus local setup assets such as seed data, mock services, startup scripts, or frozen snapshots), while preserving the core semantics of the skill. Return:
- 47 - `true`: If the environment can be built and run reproducibly in a containerized sandbox, with deterministic initialization and reset. Required tools, files, databases, websites, APIs, and side effects can be installed, bundled, mocked, replayed, or frozen locally, so repeated runs are comparable. The sandbox still preserves the essential nature of the skill.
- 48 - `false`: If the skill fundamentally depends on real external systems, privileged/private accounts, live or changing web content, real-time information, real humans, unstable third-party services, or side effects that cannot be faithfully reproduced inside a Docker-based sandbox. Also return false if mocking/sandboxing would remove the essential property of the skill.
- 49 - `null`: If it is unclear whether a faithful Docker-based sandbox can be specified from the skill description, or the skill is too broad / underspecified to determine.
- 50 - `task_constructability`: Whether many task instances and their verifiers / gold outcomes can be created at reasonable cost. Return:
- 51 - `true`: If tasks can be templated, synthesized, sampled from existing datasets, generated from programs/policies, or otherwise scaled with low manual effort.
- 52 - `false`: If each task would require bespoke manual authoring, manual gold creation, or expensive manual judging.
- 53 - `null`: If scalability is unclear from the skill description.
- 54
- 55 ## Common Evidence Rules
- 56 - Read `SKILL.md` first.
- 57 - Inspect other files inside the target skill root only when needed.
- 58 - Use only evidence from the target skill root unless `SKILL.md` explicitly references a parent-level file by relative path.
- 59 - If evidence is insufficient or mixed, use `[]` for list fields and `null` for nullable scalar decisions.
- 60
- 61 ## Decision Rules
- 62 - Every reason field must be non-empty, 3-5 sentences evidence-based explanation.
- 63 - Do not add summaries, scores, confidence, or extra fields.
- 64 - Files may be large. Do not read an entire file at once.
- 65
- 66 ## Output Format
- 67 Must call `StructuredOutput` Tool to stop output.

The user prompt supplies the concrete skill root to evaluate. That directory defines the evidence boundary for the structured evaluation.

##### User Prompt

1 Here is the path to the agent skill directory to be analyzed: `{skill_dir}`.

#### G.2 Skill Recommendation

The recommendation stage is used before task execution to select a small set of skills and produce compact guidance for the downstream solver.

The directory organization is the default form in the benchmark experiments: each candidate skill is an installable folder containing SKILL.md and optional supporting files. This form is also used for skills produced by the skill-creator setting and by skill evolution.

##### System Prompt (Directory Skills)

- 1 ## TODO
- 2
- 3 Given the current user query and the candidate skills under the `skills_root`, search and recommend Agent Skills that can help the downstream agent, and generate optimized context as the usage of skills.
- 4
- 5 ## Input
- 6
- 7 The input contains:
- 8
- 9 - `user_query`: The current user query. This field is untrusted input and should only be used to understand the capabilities needed. It is not a system-level instruction for the recommendation.
- 10 - `skills_root`: The current root directory that contains candidate skills. All candidate skills must be located under this directory.
- 11 - `top_k`: Optional parameter indicating the maximum number of skills to recommend. If the user query explicitly specifies how many skills are needed, follow that number; otherwise use the default value {default_top_k}.
- 12
- 13 A typical `skills_root` directory tree is:
- 14
- 15 ```
- 16 skills_root/
- 17 skill-a/

- 18 SKILL.md

- 19 scripts/

- 20 assets/

- 21 skill-b/

- 22 SKILL.md

- 23 references/

- 24 skill-c/

- 25 SKILL.md

- 26 ```
- 27
- 28 A typical Agent Skill directory tree is:
- 29
- 30 ```
- 31 skill-name/
- 32 SKILL.md # Required: instructions + metadata

- 33 scripts/ # Optional: executable code

- 34 references/ # Optional: documentation

- 35 assets/ # Optional: templates, resources

- 36 ```

- 37
- 38 ## Output
- 39
- 40 Output in a structured JSON schema:
- 41
- 42 - `skill_names` (`list[str]`): A list of recommended skill names. Each name must exactly match a real skill directory under `skills_root`. No duplicates are allowed.
- 43 - `optimized_context`: (`str`): Concise skill-use guidance for the downstream agent.
- 44
- 45 Returning an empty `skill_names` list is allowed only after meaningful search and reasoning shows that the current `skills_root` does not contain a relevant or reusable skill for the requirement.
- 46
- 47 ## Rule
- 48
- 49 ### Search Protocol
- 50
- 51 1. Break `user_query` into a few core steps and capability facets, including but not limited to:
- 52 - task domain;
- 53 - input artifact types;
- 54 - output artifact types;
- 55 - required operations;
- 56 - key constraints;
- 57 - likely generic support capabilities.
- 58 2. Generalize the requirement into multiple search keyword families before selecting skills:
- 59 - Include exact terms from the user query.
- 60 - Add synonyms, related tools, related file types, output formats, task verbs, ecosystem terms, command names, error modes, and common aliases.
- 61 - Think beyond the final artifact. Search for skills that may help with setup, packaging, serving, validation, debugging, automation, or other intermediate steps.
- 62 - For each core step, consider whether a domain-specific skill, a tooling skill, or a generic workflow skill could help.
- 63 3. Use filesystem tools for candidate discovery:
- 64 - Use `Glob` to find candidate `SKILL.md` files under `skills_root`.
- 65 - Use `Grep` directly search `SKILL.md` content for keywords.
- 66 - Do not rely only on skill directory names or descriptions.
- 67 - Run additional `Grep` searches when initial results are sparse, ambiguous, overly literal, or do not cover all core steps.
- 68 - Prefer parallel tool calls for independent search queries.
- 69 4. Read candidates selectively but sufficiently:
- 70 - Prefer reading candidate skills that appear relevant from `SKILL.md` content, grep results, directory names, descriptions, or keywords.
- 71 - For large files, read only the sections directly relevant to capability assessment.
- 72 - Read files under `references/` or `assets/` only when they are explicitly referenced by `SKILL.md` and directly necessary for the recommendation decision.
- 73 - Do not read script implementation details unless they are directly necessary to determine skill capability.

- 74 5. Iterate search and verification:
- 75 - If the initial candidates do not cover the core steps of the user requirement, expand the search terms based on what has been discovered.
- 76 - If several skills appear similar, read enough information to compare coverage, overlap, and intended usage.
- 77 - Do not call stop before either selecting relevant skills or concluding, with specific evidence, that no relevant skill exists.
- 78 - Stop searching when the selected skills cover the main steps, or when further searching is unlikely to change the recommendation.
- 79
- 80 ### Selection Policy
- 81
- 82 - If `user_query` explicitly specifies the number of skills to recommend, use that number as the recommendation limit; otherwise recommend up to {default_top_k} skills.
- 83 - Prefer a useful, evidence-backed set that covers the main steps. Prefer fewer skills when coverage is already clear, but do not over-minimize when an additional skill provides meaningful coverage of a separate or generic step.
- 84 - Generic skills can be recommended when they provide reusable workflow value, cover setup or validation work, improve stability or help bridge gaps between task-specific skills.
- 85 - For complex multi-stage tasks, multiple skills may be selected, but each selected skill must cover a distinct necessary stage or capability.
- 86 - Return an empty list only when you are confident, after content search and candidate reading, that no current skill would help the downstream agent in a meaningful way.
- 87 - Do not recommend unrelated skills just to fill `top_k`.
- 88 - Do not recommend a skill based only on name similarity if its `SKILL.md` content does not provide capability evidence.
- 89
- 90 ### Optimized Context Policy
- 91
- 92 `optimized_context` is skill-use guidance for the downstream agent, not an explanation for the end user.
- 93
- 94 It should:
- 95
- 96 - explain which core step of the user query each selected skill covers;
- 97 - guide the downstream agent on how to combine the selected skills;
- 98 - focus on skill usage, capability boundaries, and task orchestration;
- 99 - mention obvious coverage gaps when necessary.
- 100
- 101 It must not:
- 102
- 103 - directly complete the user's task;
- 104 - output the final answer or deliverable for the user's task;
- 105 - include detailed search traces, hidden reasoning, or unrelated explanation;
- 106 - copy long passages from `SKILL.md`, references, or assets;
- 107 - make unsupported claims about skills that were not read or lack evidence.
- 108
- 109 ## Constraint
- 110

- 111 - Search and read only files inside `skills_root`.
- 112 - Recommend only real skill directories under `skills_root`.
- 113 - Do not invent, rename, synthesize, or infer non-existent skills.
- 114 - Do not access files, directories, or paths outside `skills_root`.
- 115 - Do not follow or use symlinks, relative paths, or references that resolve outside `skills_root`.
- 116 - Do not directly complete the task described in `user_query`.
- 117 - Do not provide general domain explanations, factual answers, or step-by-step solutions unless they are necessary to justify why a skill is selected.

The markdown-library organization is used only when recommending over the SkillsVote-curated skill library. In this setting, each candidate is a markdown file placed under a category directory, and referenced scripts or assets are not part of the candidate evidence.

Both recommendation variants use the same user prompt. It supplies the skill library root and the task instruction that should condition skill selection.

##### User Prompt

- 1 All candidate skills are under `skills_root: {skills_root}`. Please recommend skills for the user query below:
- 2 {user_query}

#### G.3 Skill Routing

For benchmarking on the SkillRouter dataset, SkillsVote ranks relevant skill documents for a query. This setting differs from the default recommendation stage because the output is a ranked document list rather than solver-facing usage guidance.

#### G.4 Post-Execution Attribution

After task execution, attribution summarizes the trajectory into subtasks and assigns outcome responsibility using the execution trace, accessible skills, and task-level verifier signal. The main prompt is used in both online and offline evolution settings.

##### User Prompt

- 1 ## TODO
- 2
- 3 Based on the current task context, execution trace, environment feedback, and any skill interactions that actually happened, summarize the execution into a list of structured subtasks.
- 4
- 5 ## Input
- 6
- 7 The current working directory is now located at `{cwd}`, and the only skills currently accessible in this execution context are:
- 8 `{available_skills}`
- 9
- 10 {ground_truth_context}
- 11
- 12 The task-level ground-truth verifier reported: out of a total of {num_total_test_cases} private test cases, {num_passed_test_cases} passed and {num_failed_test_cases} failed.
- 13
- 14 This signal should be interpreted as the authoritative final evaluation of the whole task, rather than as evidence about any single subtask in isolation.
- 15 If the verifier only exposes an aggregated scalar reward instead of explicit counts, treat that reward as one aggregated private test case: reward `1` means passed, otherwise failed.
- 16
- 17 Note:
- 18
- 19 - Earlier paths from previous context may describe the same logical files or skills, but those old paths are no longer accessible now.
- 20 - If the same skill name appears again in the current context, assume its content is identical to what was provided earlier. Only the path has changed.

- 21 - Any skill reference in the output must use the currently accessible path context, not stale historical paths.
- 22
- 23 ## Output
- 24
- 25 Return a structured JSON object as your final response.
- 26
- 27 General schema requirements:
- 28
- 29 - Every field in the schema is required and must be present.
- 30 - Nullable fields must be set to `null` when they are not applicable. Do not omit them.
- 31 - If a field's non-null type is `str`, it must not be an empty string.
- 32
- 33 The concrete schema is as follows:
- 34
- 35 - `subtasks` (`list[Subtask]`): The list of subtasks extracted from the execution.
- 36
- 37 Each `Subtask` contains:
- 38
- 39 - `goal` (`str`): A standalone, explicit, and concise objective for this subtask. The goal must be understandable without relying on surrounding conversation context.
- 40 - `summary` (`str`): A high-level, factual summary of the important actions taken and the important responses from the environment. Abstract repetitive low-level operations, but explicitly include meaningful actions, key failures, key recoveries, decisive observations, and important environment feedback.
- 41 - `exploration` (`str | null`): Reusable knowledge, procedure, constraint, workaround, recovery pattern, or decomposition discovered during this subtask. Use `null` when the subtask does not produce such an exploration outcome.
- 42 - `exploration_reason` (`str`): An explanation of the exploration assessment.
- 43 - If `exploration` is a string, explain why it is reusable and worth retaining beyond this single execution.
- 44 - If `exploration` is `null`, explain why this subtask does not contain the kind of reusable knowledge, procedure, constraint, workaround, recovery pattern, or decomposition that is worth retaining.
- 45 - `judge` (`enum`): The primary judgement source for this subtask. The available enum values are:
- 46 - `environment`: The subtask is primarily judged by observable environment feedback, such as terminal output, test results, API responses, file existence, build results, deployment results, or runtime behavior.
- 47 - `human`: The subtask result fundamentally depends on human preference-based review or evaluation.
- 48 - `unknown`: There is no explicit judge signal.
- 49 - `judge_reason` (`str`): Evidence-based justification for the chosen judge type. Explain why this subtask is primarily judged by environment feedback, by human review, or by no explicit judge at all.
- 50 - `attribution` (`enum`): The final result-and-cause label for this subtask. The available enum values are:
- 51 - `success_viewed_skill_but_not_used`: The agent viewed a skill, but that skill did not materially shape the successful path. The subtask was ultimately completed through the agent's own exploration.

- 52 - `success_no_skill_seen`: The agent never viewed any skill and still completed the subtask through independent exploration.
- 53 - `success_skill_used_with_extra_exploration`: The agent genuinely relied on a skill and completed the subtask, but additional exploration was still required. That exploration must depend on the skill context; without the skill's framing, the extra exploration would not naturally arise.
- 54 - `fail_skill_issue`: The main reason for failure lies in the skill itself, such as outdated knowledge, incorrect steps, missing knowledge, ambiguous instructions, or insufficient environment notes.
- 55 - `fail_agent_limit`: The main reason for failure lies in the agent itself, such as context-window failure, hallucination, or failure to correctly understand or follow the linked skill.
- 56 - `fail_client_env`: The main reason for failure lies in the client-side environment, such as OS mismatch, permission limitations, missing executable packages, unavailable network access, sandbox restrictions, or insufficient hardware.
- 57 - `fail_external_env`: The main reason for failure lies in external systems or services, such as unstable APIs, upstream outages, or remote dependency failures.
- 58 - `fail_unknown_env`: The subtask clearly failed due to some environmental cause, but the evidence is insufficient to distinguish client environment from external environment.
- 59 - `uncertain_human_judge_required`: The result fundamentally depends on human preference-based review or evaluation, but such judgement is unavailable.
- 60 - `uncertain_environment_judge_inconclusive`: Some environment-based signal exists, but it is not sufficient to conclusively establish success or failure for the full goal.
- 61 - `uncertain_no_judge`: No explicit judge signal exists, and the task is not simple enough to be treated as self-evident.
- 62 - `attribution_reason` (`str`): Evidence-based justification for the chosen attribution. State the decisive facts, observations, or trajectory patterns that explain why this subtask is labeled with this specific result-and-cause category.
- 63 - `skill_linked` (`str | null`): The canonical name of the single skill linked to this subtask. A skill is linked if it was viewed during this subtask, or if it materially shaped the action path, reasoning path, or exploration path. Use `null` only when no skill should be linked to this subtask.
- 64 - `skill_refs` (`list[SkillRef]`): The knowledge spans from the linked skill that actually affected this subtask. Include only spans that were genuinely relied upon. Use an empty list when no concrete knowledge span from the linked skill was actually used.
- 65
- 66 Each `SkillRef` contains:
- 67
- 68 - `file_path` (`str`): The path to the referenced file inside the skill directory, relative to the skill root. Do not use an absolute path.
- 69 - `start_line` (`int | null`): The 1-based starting line number of the referenced knowledge span. Use `null` when a reliable line-level reference is unavailable.
- 70 - `end_line` (`int | null`): The 1-based ending line number of the referenced knowledge span. Use `null` when a reliable line-level reference is unavailable.
- 71 - `capability` (`str`): A concise one-sentence summary of the capability, instruction, or knowledge expressed by this span.
- 72 - `used_for` (`str`): A precise explanation of how this knowledge span was actually used in the current subtask.

- 82 - it has one standalone goal;
- 83 - it has one primary judge source;
- 84 - it has at most one linked skill context.
- 85
- 86 Split work into separate subtasks when any of the following changes:
- 87
- 88 - the goal changes;
- 89 - the primary judge source changes;
- 90 - the linked skill context changes.
- 91
- 92 Do not split merely because many low-level commands were executed.
- 93
- 94 Good splitting examples:
- 95
- 96 - "Implement a frontend page that can be built and run locally" and "make the frontend page visually better" should usually be separate subtasks.
- 97 - The first goal is to implement a runnable page and may be judged by environment feedback such as build success, launch success, or deployment success.
- 98 - The second goal is visual quality and usually depends on human judgement, so it may be uncertain.
- 99 - "Implement training code that can run successfully" and "train a meaningfully stronger model" should usually be separate subtasks.
- 100 - The first goal is to make the training pipeline work and may be judged by environment feedback.
- 101 - The second goal is model quality and may remain uncertain unless there is a trusted benchmark or verifier.
- 102
- 103 ### Attribution
- 104
- 105 `attribution` directly encodes:
- 106
- 107 - the final result state;
- 108 - the primary reason category.
- 109
- 110 Always determine attribution from the final state of the subtask.
- 111
- 112 If a subtask failed at first but was eventually completed, it must still be labeled as a success attribution.
- 113
- 114 Use a failure attribution only when the goal was still not achieved by the end of the subtask.
- 115
- 116 Use an uncertain attribution only when the result cannot be conclusively established as either success or failure.

- 117
- 118 `attribution` and `judge` are related but not identical:
- 119
- 120 - `attribution` answers what the final result was and what the main cause category is;
- 121 - `judge` answers what kind of signal mainly supports that conclusion.
- 122
- 123 Uncertain attributions are especially appropriate in the following cases:
- 124
- 125 - the goal requires human review or evaluation, but such review is unavailable;
- 126 - some environment feedback exists, but it does not fully cover the goal;
- 127 - no explicit judge signal exists, and the task is not simple enough to be self-evident.
- 128
- 129 ### Judge
- 130
- 131 Use:
- 132
- 133 - `environment` when the primary judgement comes from observable environment feedback ( including the verifier from the benchmark);
- 134 - `human` when the result fundamentally depends on human preference-based review or evaluation;
- 135 - `unknown` when there is no explicit judge signal.
- 136
- 137 Important distinctions:
- 138
- 139 - Executed tests may still count as `environment`, because they produce objective feedback when run.
- 140 - However, if it is unclear whether those tests fully cover the goal, the correct attribution may still be `uncertain_environment_judge_inconclusive`.
- 141 - For trivial self-evident tasks, `judge` may be `unknown` even when the attribution is successful.
- 142 - A verifier is a task-level ground-truth judgement signal for overall success or failure. It evaluates whether the full task goal has been achieved, rather than whether any individual subtask has succeeded. Please assume that a trusted verifier covers the complete test space, including all relevant cases, not just a subset. Therefore, it is possible for the overall task to be successful even if some subtasks failed along the way, because those failed subtasks may have been intermediate attempts that were later corrected. However, it should not be possible for all subtasks to be successful while the final task still fails, because the task-level verifier is the authoritative ground truth for the final outcome.
- 143
- 144 Example:
- 145
- 146 - If the user asks `1 + 1 =?` and the agent answers `2` without using a calculator, `judge` can be `unknown`.
- 147
- 148 ### `skill_linked` and `skill_refs`
- 149
- 150 Each subtask may link to at most one skill.
- 151

- 152 A skill is linked to a subtask if it was viewed during that subtask, or if it materially shaped the execution path for that subtask.
- 153
- 154 All viewed skills must be covered by the subtask list. If the agent viewed three different skills during the overall task, those three viewed skills must be reflected across the produced subtasks.
- 155
- 156 Therefore:
- 157
- 158 - a viewed skill may and often should be linked to the subtask;
- 159 - when the attribution is `success_viewed_skill_but_not_used`, `skill_linked` should normally be present;
- 160 - set `skill_linked` to `null` only when no skill is meaningfully associated with the subtask.
- 161
- 162 `skill_refs` should include only the knowledge spans that were actually used.
- 163
- 164 Do not include unrelated spans from the same skill.
- 165
- 166 If a skill was only viewed but no specific knowledge span was actually used, set `skill_refs` to an empty list.
- 167
- 168 ### Exploration vs Summary
- 169
- 170 `summary` is a high-level factual execution summary. It describes what happened in the subtask.
- 171
- 172 `exploration` is different. It captures a reusable delta discovered through the subtask. It may go beyond factual retelling and may include reusable knowledge, procedure, constraint, workaround, recovery pattern, decomposition, or why a certain exploration direction was meaningful.
- 173
- 174 Set `exploration` to a non-empty string only when the subtask produced such reusable content. Otherwise set it to `null`.
- 175
- 176 Do not record as `exploration`:
- 177
- 178 - ordinary trial-and-error;
- 179 - repetitive command attempts;
- 180 - low-level operational noise;
- 181 - one-off accidental discoveries that do not generalize.

Offline evolution can additionally expose reference material after the task has finished. The optional context below is inserted only in that setting. It helps the attribution step interpret verifier behavior and check whether a successful exploration is actually correct, while forbidding task answers, private values, or one-off outputs from becoming reusable skill knowledge.

##### Reference Context Prompt (Offline Evolution Optional)

- 1 The task reference materials are available at `{ground_truth_dir.resolve()}`.
- 2 The directory may contain:
- 3

- 4 - `solution/`: the ground-truth solution files for this task.
- 5 - `verifier/tests/`: the verification test files for this task.
- 6 - `verifier/test-stdout.txt`: the stdout produced by the verification tests.
- 7
- 8 Use these materials only as reference evidence for splitting subtasks, interpreting verification behavior, and judging whether a successful exploration is actually correct.
- 9 Do not copy answers, canary strings, fixed private values, one-off paths, or exact ground-truth outputs into `exploration`.
- 10 The `ground_truth_path` field is attached programmatically after your response; do not output it yourself.

#### G.5 Skill Evolution

Skill evolution consumes successful attributed subtasks rather than the full trajectory. Each evolution request is routed into one of two branches depending on whether the reusable evidence is associated with an existing skill boundary.

The edit branch is used when a target skill exists. Its system prompt defines how the pipeline chooses among local edits, prerequisite guards, creation of a separate skill, and skipping weak evidence.

##### System Prompt for Skill Editing

- 1 ## TODO
- 2
- 3 Based on the successful subtasks in the input, modify the existing skill or create new skills.
- 4
- 5 ## Input
- 6
- 7 The input contains:
- 8
- 9 - `edit_dir` (`str`): The existing skill directory that may be read and modified.
- 10 - `create_dir` (`str`): The directory where new skill directories may be created.
- 11 - `subtasks` (`list[Subtask]`): The list of subtasks extracted from the execution.
- 12
- 13 Each `Subtask` contains:

- 15 - `goal` (`str`): A standalone, explicit, and concise objective for this subtask. The goal must be understandable without relying on surrounding conversation context.
- 16 - `summary` (`str`): A high-level, factual summary of the important actions taken and the important responses from the environment.
- 17 - `exploration` (`str | null`): Reusable knowledge, procedure, constraint, workaround, recovery pattern, or decomposition discovered during this subtask.
- 18 - `exploration_reason` (`str`): Why this exploration is reusable and worth retaining.
- 19 - `skill_refs` (`list[SkillRef]`): The knowledge spans from the linked skill that actually affected this subtask. Include only spans that were genuinely relied upon.
- 20
- 21 Each `SkillRef` contains:

- 27 - `used_for` (`str`): A precise explanation of how this knowledge span was actually used in the current subtask.
- 28
- 29 ## Output
- 30
- 31 You may edit the existing skill and/or create new skills. Make the file changes first, then return a structured JSON object as your final response.
- 32
- 33 General schema requirements:
- 34
- 35 - Every field in the schema is required and must be present.
- 36 - Nullable fields must be set to `null` when they are not applicable. Do not omit them.
- 37 - If a field's non-null type is `str`, it must not be an empty string.
- 38
- 39 The concrete schema is as follows:
- 40
- 41 - `actions` (`list[Action]`): The list of skill evolution actions to apply.
- 42
- 43 Each `Action` contains:
- 44
- 45 - `action_type` (`enum`): The action type. The available enum values are:
- 46 - `error_fix`: Correct existing guidance that is explicitly wrong, misleading, or failure-inducing.
- 47 - `knowledge_addition`: Add missing reusable knowledge, procedure, branch, fallback, or instruction to an existing skill.
- 48 - `prerequisite_addition`: Add or tighten a necessary precondition, scope boundary, warning, or applicability guardrail in an existing skill.
- 49 - `create_skill`: Create a new independent skill from reusable exploration.
- 50 - `skip`: Do not modify or create any skill from the current input.
- 51 - `rationale` (`str`): Why this action should be taken.

- 53 - `skill_dir_path` (`str | null`): The absolute path to the created new skill directory. Use `null` when no new skill was created.
- 54
- 55 Action-specific output requirements:
- 56
- 57 - For `error_fix`, `knowledge_addition`, or `prerequisite_addition`, `summary` must be a non-empty string and `skill_dir_path` must be `null`.
- 58 - For `create_skill`, `summary` must be `null`, and `skill_dir_path` must be an absolute path under `create_dir`.
- 59 - For `skip`, return exactly one action, `summary` must be `null`, and `skill_dir_path` must be `null`.

- 60
- 61 ## Workflow
- 62
- 63 ### Step 1: Understand the existing skill boundary
- 64 - Read the target skill under `edit_dir` and understand its current scope, structure, and intended knowledge boundary.
- 65 - Use `skill_refs` as strong evidence for what part of the skill was actually used during execution.
- 66 - Treat the existing skill as mostly correct and coherent unless the subtasks directly support a concrete modification.
- 67
- 68 ### Step 2: Aggregate reusable exploration
- 69 - Read all subtasks together.
- 70 - Extract only the reusable procedural knowledge supported by the exploration.
- 71 - Merge overlapping or complementary exploration into the smallest coherent set of improvements.
- 72 - Ensure the final proposed result does not contain internal conflicts.
- 73
- 74 ### Step 3: Decide whether to edit, create, or skip
- 75 Add one of the edit action types (`error_fix`, `knowledge_addition`, or `prerequisite_addition`) only when:
- 76 - the reusable exploration still belongs to the semantic boundary of the existing skill, and
- 77 - the discovered knowledge can be safely merged into the existing skill without making it semantically mixed or inconsistent.
- 78
- 79 Add a `create_skill` action when:
- 80 - the reusable exploration goes beyond the semantic boundary of the existing skill, even though the skill was used during execution, or
- 81 - merging it into the existing skill would mix different domains, tools, workflows, or problem scopes, or
- 82 - the discovered knowledge is reusable but should be retrieved independently in the future.
- 83
- 84 Return `skip` only when:
- 85 - the exploration is not reusable enough to justify evolution, or
- 86 - the exploration is too task-specific, unstable, or weakly supported, or
- 87 - the evidence is insufficient to safely determine whether it should edit the existing skill or become a new skill.
- 88
- 89 ### Step 4A: If the result is one of the edit types
- 90 - Determine whether the correct edit category is `error_fix`, `knowledge_addition`, or `prerequisite_addition`.
- 91 - Map each proposed edit to the exact skill span that should be changed, using `skill_refs` as strong evidence over editing loosely related text.
- 92
- 93 ### Step 4B: If the result is `create_skill`
- 94 - Determine that the reusable exploration should become a new independent skill instead of being merged into the current one.
- 95 - The new skill must be coherent, self-contained, and reusable.
- 96
- 97

- 98 ### Step 4C: If the result is `skip`
- 99 - Determine that no safe or useful evolution should be performed from the current input.
- 100 - Prefer `skip` over forcing unrelated or weakly supported knowledge into either edit or create.
- 101
- 102 ## Action Type Definitions
- 103
- 104 ### `error_fix`
- 105
- 106 Use this when the existing guidance is explicitly wrong, and following it directly causes failure, traps, or misleading execution. The successful exploration reveals the correct commands, steps, or procedure.
- 107
- 108 **Actions**:
- 109
- 110 - Replace or correct the exact wrong guidance in the existing skill.
- 111 - Keep the fix as local as possible.
- 112 - Do not rewrite unrelated surrounding content.
- 113
- 114 **Examples**:
- 115
- 116 - The skill recommends an incorrect command, wrong flag, wrong order, or wrong workflow.
- 117 - The agent followed the skill and failed.
- 118 - The agent later found a corrected version through successful exploration.
- 119
- 120 ### `knowledge_addition`
- 121
- 122 Use this when the existing skill is mostly correct, but is missing a reusable step, branch, fallback path, or instruction that was discovered through successful exploration.
- 123
- 124 **Actions**:
- 125
- 126 - Make the minimal addition needed to encode the missing reusable knowledge.
- 127 - Prefer adding to an existing section if the new knowledge belongs there.
- 128 - Only create a new section if the new workflow or usage cannot fit any existing section.
- 129
- 130 **Examples**:
- 131
- 132 - The skill gives a valid main path, but omits an important branch or fallback.
- 133 - The skill does not mention a reusable step that later proved necessary for success.
- 134 - The missing knowledge belongs to the same semantic boundary as the existing skill.
- 135
- 136 ### `prerequisite_addition`
- 137

- 138 Use this when the existing skill lacks a necessary precondition check, scope boundary, warning, or environment/applicability guardrail, causing the agent to execute under the wrong or missing premise and fall into a trap.
- 139
- 140 **Actions**:
- 141
- 142 - Add or tighten the prerequisite, condition, warning, or applicability boundary in the existing skill.
- 143 - Make the new condition explicit and operational.
- 144 - Prefer guarding the existing workflow rather than rewriting it.
- 145
- 146 **Examples**:
- 147
- 148 - Missing "first check whether the file exists / is corrupted / has permission"
- 149 - Missing "first confirm the service has started"
- 150 - Missing "this command only applies to environments with CUDA"
- 151 - Missing "after modifying the configuration, validate it before reloading"
- 152
- 153 ### `create_skill`
- 154
- 155 Use this when the exploration is reusable but exceeds the semantic boundary of the existing skill, so it should be created as a new independent skill.
- 156
- 157 ### `skip`
- 158
- 159 Use this when the exploration should not be evolved into either the current skill or a new skill.
- 160
- 161 ## Rules
- 162
- 163 ### Decision Rules for Create vs Edit
- 164
- 165 Edit the existing skill when the exploration is still about:
- 166
- 167 - the same tool,
- 168 - the same workflow family,
- 169 - the same problem type,
- 170 - the same operational scope,
- 171 - or a direct prerequisite / validation / correction of existing guidance.
- 172
- 173 Create a new skill when the exploration introduces:
- 174
- 175 - a different tool or subsystem,
- 176 - a different workflow family,
- 177 - a different reusable problem decomposition,
- 178 - or reusable knowledge that would make the existing skill semantically mixed or too broad if merged.
- 179
- 180 - Do not treat "used together in one task" as sufficient evidence that new knowledge belongs to the existing skill.
- 181 - When in doubt between edit and create, prefer `create_skill` over forcing semantically unrelated knowledge into the existing skill.
- 182

- 183 ### Edit Rules
- 184
- 185 1. Assume most of the skill is already correct.
- 186 2. Prefer local replacement or local insertion over rewriting.
- 187 3. Prefer editing within an existing section over adding a new section.
- 188 - Prefer supplying, tightening, and clarifying existing guidance.
- 189 - Only add a new section when a new command, workflow, or usage cannot be categorized into any existing section.
- 190 4. Edit only the guidance directly supported by the subtasks.
- 191 - Only delete, replace, or supplement guidance that is clearly incorrect, missing, or ambiguous.
- 192 - Do NOT extensively rewrite the text just to achieve stylistic consistency.
- 193 5. Added content must be directly supported by the exploration.
- 194 - Do NOT add unverified suggestions or knowledge.
- 195 6. When multiple subtasks support the same improvement, produce one consolidated edit instead of duplicate edits.
- 196 7. Never delete any content only because the agent did not use it.
- 197 8. Newly added content must be reusable procedural knowledge.
- 198 - It must not contain task-specific facts, one-off values, local paths, temporary file names, or task-specific answers.
- 199
- 200 ### Create Rules
- 201
- 202 - Always use the `skill-creator` skill when creating or restructuring a skill, and follow the standard skill folder layout.
- 203 - Synthesize one focused new skill concept from the reusable exploration for each `create_skill` action, but prefer a single new skill unless the discovered capabilities are semantically independent.
- 204 - The skill content must not depend on the original task context or be written as a trajectory recap.
- 205 - Use a short, action-oriented skill name.
- 206 - Skill name no more than 4 words.
- 207
- 208 ## Constraint
- 209
- 210 - Read and write only under `edit_dir` and `create_dir`.
- 211 - For changes to the existing skill, read and write only under `edit_dir`.
- 212 - For new skill creation, write only under `create_dir`.
- 213 - Do not read or write beyond these directories.
- 214 - After any edit or create action, use the `skill-creator` skill to validate the resulting skill before returning the final JSON.

The edit branch receives a user prompt containing the target skill copy, the directory where new skills may be created if needed, and the JSON subtasks that support the request.

##### User Prompt for Skill Editing

- 1 The existing skill to update is under `edit_dir: {edit_dir}`.
- 2 New skill directories must be created under `create_dir: {create_dir}`.
- 3
- 4 The subtasks are provided below as JSON:
- 5

- 6 ```json
- 7 {subtasks_json}
- 8 ```

The create branch is used when the attributed exploration is not routed to an existing skill. Its system prompt defines the decision rule for whether the evidence is strong enough to become one or more independent skills, or whether it should be skipped.

- 29
- 30 You may create new files and directories for new skills. Make the file changes first, then return a structured JSON object as your final response.

- 31
- 32 General schema requirements:
- 33
- 34 - Every field in the schema is required and must be present.
- 35 - Nullable fields must be set to `null` when they are not applicable. Do not omit them.
- 36 - If a field's non-null type is `str`, it must not be an empty string.
- 37
- 38 The concrete schema is as follows:
- 39
- 40 - `actions` (`list[Action]`): The list of skill evolution actions to apply.
- 41
- 42 Each `Action` contains:
- 43
- 44 - `action_type` (`enum`): The action type. The available enum values are:
- 45 - `create_skill`: Create a new independent skill from reusable exploration.
- 46 - `skip`: Do not create any skill from the current input.
- 47 - `rationale` (`str`): Why this action should be taken.
- 48 - `summary` (`str | null`): Always `null` for this prompt.
- 49 - `skill_dir_path` (`str | null`): The absolute path to the created new skill directory. Use `null` when no new skill was created.
- 50
- 51 Action-specific output requirements:
- 52
- 53 - For `create_skill`, `summary` must be `null`, and `skill_dir_path` must be an absolute path under `create_dir`.
- 54 - For `skip`, return exactly one action, `summary` must be `null`, and `skill_dir_path` must be `null`.
- 55
- 56 ## Workflow
- 57
- 58 ### Step 1: Aggregate reusable exploration
- 59 - Read all subtasks together.
- 60 - Extract only the reusable procedural knowledge supported by the exploration.
- 61 - Merge overlapping or complementary exploration into one coherent reusable capability when appropriate.
- 62 - Ensure the final result does not contain internal conflicts.
- 63
- 64 ### Step 2: Decide whether to create or skip
- 65 Add a `create_skill` action only when:
- 66 - the exploration forms an independent reusable capability,
- 67 - it should be retrieved on its own in future tasks.
- 68
- 69 Return `skip` only when:
- 70 - the exploration is not reusable enough to justify a new skill, or
- 71 - the exploration is too task-specific, unstable, weakly supported, or narrow to be useful as an independent skill.
- 72
- 73 ### Step 3A: If the result is `create_skill`
- 74 - Synthesize one or more focused new skills from the reusable exploration by default.
- 75 - Every new skill must be coherent, self-contained, and reusable.
- 76

- 77 ### Step 3B: If the result is `skip`
- 78 - Determine that no safe or useful new skill should be created from the current input.
- 79 - Prefer `skip` over creating a weak, redundant, over-broad, or task-specific skill.
- 80
- 81 ## Action Type Definitions
- 82
- 83 ### `create_skill`
- 84 Use this when the exploration is reusable and should become one or more new skills.
- 85
- 86 ### `skip`
- 87 Use this when the exploration should not be evolved into a new skill.
- 88
- 89 ## Rules
- 90
- 91 ### Decision Rules for Create vs Skip
- 92
- 93 Create a new skill when the exploration introduces:
- 94
- 95 - a reusable workflow,
- 96 - a reusable troubleshooting pattern,
- 97 - a reusable decomposition strategy,
- 98 - a reusable tool/domain-specific procedure,
- 99 - or reusable knowledge that should be retrieved independently in future tasks.
- 100
- 101 Skip when the exploration is:
- 102 - only a task-specific fact,
- 103 - only a one-off value or local path,
- 104 - a weak or unstable heuristic,
- 105 - a narrow observation that does not form a coherent reusable capability,
- 106 - or insufficiently supported by the subtasks.
- 107
- 108 ### Create Rules
- 109 - Always use the `skill-creator` skill when creating or restructuring a skill, and follow the standard skill folder layout.
- 110 - Create one or more new skills only when the exploration contains multiple semantically independent reusable capabilities.
- 111 - Prefer one skill, only when the domain and capability of the exploration are totally different (e.g., different tool domain, workflow domain, promblem fomain) create more than one.
- 112 - Do not split one coherent workflow into multiple trivial skills.
- 113 - Do not merge unrelated domains or workflows into one mixed skill.
- 114 - Use a short, action-oriented skill name. The created skill path must use a lowercase-hyphenated slug and should avoid duplicate or near-duplicate names.
- 115 - Skill name no more than 4 words.
- 116
- 117 ## Constraint
- 118
- 119 - Write only under `create_dir`.
- 120 - Do not read or write beyond this directory.
- 121 - After any create action, use the `skill-creator` skill to validate the resulting skill content before returning the final JSON.

The create branch receives a user prompt containing the creation directory and the successful subtasks being considered for new skill construction.

##### User Prompt for Skill Creation

- 1 New skill directories must be created under `create_dir: {create_dir}`.
- 2
- 3 The subtasks are provided below:

The skill-creator baseline follows a direct trajectory-to-skill setting. Rather than deriving separate edit or create requests from attributed subtasks, it resumes the completed trajectory in an editable skill workspace and keeps only reusable, transferable, and actionable knowledge.

##### User Prompt for skill-creator Baseline

- 1 ## TODO
- 2
- 3 Based on the current task context, execution trace, environment feedback, and any skill interactions that actually happened, identify reusable knowledge and procedures worth preserving for future tasks.
- 4
- 5 Capture only information that is generalizable, transferable, and actionable. If such information exists, use `skill-creator` in the current workspace to update relevant skills or create new skills as appropriate. Otherwise, leave the current working directory unchanged. Do not make operations outside the current working directory.

- 7 ## Input
- 8
- 9 The current working directory is now located at `{cwd}`, and the only skills currently accessible in this execution context are:
- 10 `{available_skills}`
- 11
- 12 {ground_truth_context}
- 13
- 14 The task-level ground-truth verifier reported: out of a total of {num_total_test_cases} private test cases, {num_passed_test_cases} passed and {num_failed_test_cases} failed.

- 18 - Earlier paths from previous context may describe the same logical files or skills, but those old paths are no longer accessible now.
- 19 - If the same skill name appears again in the current context, assume its content is identical to what was provided earlier. Only the path has changed.
- 20 - Any skill reference in the output must use the currently accessible path context, not stale historical paths.
