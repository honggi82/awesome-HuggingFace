### Abstract

Dense retrievers exhibit positional bias, favoring documents whose query-relevant information appears near the beginning and degrading retrieval performance when the information appears later. While prior work on positional bias in dense retrievers has largely focused on architectural explanations, we study how the positional distribution of evidence in training data affects retrieval-level bias direction. To test this, we construct synthetic position-targeted training sets in which query-relevant evidence appears at the beginning, middle, or end of documents, and fine-tune eight architecturally diverse pretrained models under position-skewed and balanced training distributions. At the ranking level, we observe a strong directional pattern across the examined models: skewed training distributions favor evidence at the corresponding positions. Position-balanced training reduces positional sensitivity by 57–87% on position-aware benchmarks, with competitive mean retrieval performance in our controlled setting. Representation-level analyses further suggest that fine-tuning often reshapes learned positional preferences, although pre-existing architectural or pretraining-specific tendencies persist in some models. These results identify training-position distribution as a major controllable factor in retrieval-level position bias and suggest balanced data curation as a practical mitigation strategy.

### 1 Introduction

Dense retrievers (Karpukhin et al., 2020; Izacard et al., 2022) now serve as a core component in open-domain question answering and retrievalaugmented generation (Lewis et al., 2020; Jeong et al., 2024). Yet they exhibit a systematic position bias. Retrieval performance drops substantially when query-relevant information appears in the middle or end of a document rather than near the

beginning (Coelho et al., 2024; Zeng et al., 2025). A retriever that disproportionately favors early positions risks missing critical information, potentially degrading downstream tasks such as retrievalaugmented generation (Fayyaz et al., 2025). Understanding the source of this bias is therefore important to prevent such performance degradation.

Prior work has largely examined position bias empirically: it has been observed across training stages (Coelho et al., 2024), positional encodings (Lee et al., 2025), and pooling-token attention patterns (Schuhmacher et al., 2026). Zeng et al. (2026) further show that positional sensitivity does not correlate with architectural factors. The underlying cause in dense retrievers thus remains unclear. In autoregressive transformers, causal attention has been identified as a primary cause of position bias (Wang et al., 2025; Wu et al., 2025). Yet encoderbased dense retrievers—which lack causal masking—still exhibit strong primacy bias (Coelho et al., 2024; Zeng et al., 2025), indicating that architectural factors alone may not fully explain position bias in dense retrievers.

This raises a fundamental question: to what extent can retrieval-level position bias be changed by the positional distribution of fine-tuning data, beyond tendencies induced by architecture and pretraining? In this work, we hypothesize that training-position distribution is an important factor in shaping retrieval-level position bias in dense retrievers. Two forms of positional skew motivate this hypothesis: in training corpora, texts such as news articles place key information in early positions (Po¨ttker, 2003; Catena et al., 2019), and in retrieval fine-tuning data, such as MS MARCO, query-relevant passages are heavily concentrated in early document positions (Hofstätter et al., 2021; Coelho et al., 2024). Yet no prior work has directly manipulated training data to isolate its role.

To test this hypothesis, we construct positioncontrolled datasets in which query-relevant infor-

mation appears at the beginning, middle, or end of documents, and fine-tune eight architecturally diverse pretrained models—covering encoder and decoder architectures, multiple positional encodings, and different pooling strategies—on them. If models with fundamentally different positional processing nevertheless develop bias patterns that mirror the training distribution, this would suggest that architecture alone cannot fully explain the bias. We evaluate on position-aware benchmarks to measure positional sensitivity and on standard retrieval benchmarks to examine how these training distributions affect performance under conventional evaluation settings.

Our key finding is that retrieval-level position bias direction follows the training data distribution across all eight models, despite their architectural differences: begin-skewed data produces begin-favoring retrieval, mid-skewed data produces mid-favoring retrieval, and end-skewed data produces end-favoring retrieval. Position-balanced training reduces positional sensitivity on positionaware benchmarks while preserving competitive retrieval performance, suggesting that data curation can reduce position bias.

Our contributions are as follows:

- • We design a position-controlled data construction pipeline and release the datasets, enabling controlled experiments on the effect of training data on retrieval-level position bias.
- • We show that training data distributions shape the direction of retrieval-level position bias, with controlled experiments on eight architecturally diverse models revealing predictable shifts in bias direction.
- • We show that position-balanced training reduces positional sensitivity while preserving competitive retrieval performance, suggesting that position bias can be reduced through data curation.

### 2 Related Work

Position Bias in Dense Retrievers. Dense retrievers exhibit position bias, favoring evidence at the beginning of documents (Fayyaz et al., 2025; Lee et al., 2025; Zeng et al., 2025). Across retriever types, dense embedding and ColBERT-style models show performance degradation due to this bias, while BM25 and cross-encoder rerankers remain robust (Zeng et al., 2025). Zeng et al. (2026) evaluate embedding models on a position-aware benchmark

and find that most exhibit primacy bias, though positional sensitivity does not correlate with architectural factors—model size, vector dimension, attention mechanism, or pooling strategy. Similarly, Lee

- et al. (2025) report that the bias persists across positional encodings—APE, ALiBi, and RoPE. These findings show that position bias is widespread in dense retrievers, but they do not explain its cause.

Architectural Explanations. Prior studies have examined architecture-based explanations for position bias in dense retrievers, but they do not fully explain the observed bias patterns. Schuhmacher

- et al. (2026) link primacy bias to front-loaded selfattention in pooling-token embeddings of encoderbased models, though its generality across the diverse architectures used in dense retrieval has not been established. In autoregressive transformers, by contrast, Wu et al. (2025) prove that causal attention favors earlier tokens with deeper layers amplifying the effect, and Wang et al. (2025) show that RoPE favors nearby tokens through distancedependent attention decay. However, encoderbased dense retrievers, which lack causal masking, still exhibit strong primacy bias (Coelho et al., 2024; Zeng et al., 2025), and RoPE based decoder retrievers such as Qwen3-Embedding show primacy rather than recency bias (Zeng et al., 2025, 2026), indicating that architectural factors alone do not fully explain position bias in dense retrievers.

Training Data as a Source of Bias. Training data has also been implicated as a source of position bias. Coelho et al. (2024) show that position bias emerges during unsupervised contrastive pre-training and is amplified by MS MARCO fine-tuning, where relevant passages are disproportionately concentrated in early document positions. Similarly, Fayyaz et al. (2025) find that MS MARCO-trained models exhibit stronger position bias than unsupervised Contriever. Earlier work connects training data to position bias in rerankers: Hofstätter et al. (2021) show that rerankers trained on data with early-skewed answer positions inherit this bias. Across these studies, training data appears as a common factor, yet the evidence comes from observation rather than direct manipulation of the positional distribution. Our work addresses this gap by training eight architecturally diverse models on position-controlled datasets, providing direct evidence that training data distribution drives the direction of position bias in dense retrievers.

### 3 Method

Our approach has two components: a data construction pipeline that produces position-controlled training datasets (§3.1), and an experimental design that tests how changing the positional distribution of fine-tuning data affects retrieval-level position bias (§3.2).

#### 3.1 Position-Controlled Data Construction

We construct datasets where the location of queryrelevant information is controlled through a threestage pipeline: corpus preparation with lengthstratified binning, position-targeted query generation, and multi-reranker position verification.

- 3.1.1 Corpus Preparation We use English Wikipedia as our source corpus for its topical diversity and wide range of article lengths. Within each pool, we stratify articles by character count into five length bins (256–512, 512–1024, 1024–2048, 2048–4096, and 4096–8192), using character count rather than token count for tokenizer-agnostic consistency across models. Each document is divided into three equallength segments—beginning, middle, and endfollowing Zeng et al. (2025).
- 3.1.2 Position-Targeted Query Generation For each document, we generate queries targeting each of the three positional segments using personaconditioned prompting with GPT-4o-mini1, following Zhang et al. (2025). A persona is sampled from PersonaHub (Ge et al., 2025) to encourage diverse information needs; the model then generates a query answerable from only the target segment. This yields three query subsets—qbegin, qmid, and qend—where the same document appears in all three, each time paired with a different positiontargeted query. Details of the generation prompts are provided in Appendix A.
- 3.1.3 Multi-Reranker Position Verification The generation prompt asks the LLM to produce a query answerable from the intended target segment, but this constraint is not guaranteed: a generated query may also be answerable from a non-target segment or from multiple segments. To filter such cases, we verify each generated candidate with a panel of three cross-encoder rerankers: bge-reranker-v2-m3

1https://developers.openai.com/api/ docs/models/gpt-4o-mini

(Chen et al., 2024), gte-multilingual-reranker-base (Zhang et al., 2024), and jina-reranker-v2-basemultilingual2.

We use cross-encoder rerankers, rather than dense retrievers, as verifiers because fullinteraction rerankers have been shown to be more robust to evidence position than dense embedding models (Zeng et al., 2025). This reduces the risk that the filtering step itself inherits the position bias that we aim to study.

The verification rule requires unanimous agreement across rerankers. Let q be a generated query for document d, and let t ∈ P be its intended target position, where P = {begin,middle,end}. We denote the segment at position i by si.

For each reranker R ∈ R, we score each segment as

rR,i = R(q,si), i ∈ P. (1)

The candidate is retained only if every reranker scores the target segment at least δ higher than the strongest non-target segment:

rR,u ≥ δ, ∀R ∈ R. (2)

rR,t − max

u̸=t

The maximum is taken over the two non-target positions. Thus, even the least favorable reranker must prefer the intended target segment by at least the margin threshold δ.

All main experiments use a margin threshold of δ = 0.3. Appendix B reports filtering statistics under different margin thresholds and an independent segment-wise LLM audit. We refer to the candidates that pass this rule as the retained pool.

#### 3.1.4 Controlled Training Set Sampling

Applying the multi-reranker position-verification rule with margin threshold δ = 0.3 yields 481,236 retained candidate examples for training. Table 1 reports the retained pool by length bin and target position.

The retained pool is not position-balanced, so we do not train on it directly. Instead, we construct the final training sets by downsampling within length-position cells. The smallest retained lengthposition cell is the middle-position cell in the 4096– 8192 length bin, which contains 8,189 examples. This cell determines the sampling budget for the controlled training configurations defined in Section 3.2.

Table 1: Retained candidate examples by length bin and target position after the multi-reranker positionverification rule with margin threshold δ = 0.3, before downsampling.

This downsampling step ensures that the final training sets use the same number of examples from each length bin, rather than inheriting the uneven length and position counts of the retained pool. As a result, later comparisons are not driven by differences in training size or document length.

#### 3.2 Position-Controlled Experiment Design

Our experimental design tests whether retrievallevel position bias follows the positional distribution of training data across models with different architectural properties.

- 3.2.1 Model Selection and Initial Tendencies We select eight pretrained models without retrievalspecific fine-tuning, spanning encoder and decoder architectures, multiple positional encodings, and different pooling strategies. This diversity is central to our design: if models with fundamentally different positional processing develop bias patterns that mirror their training data, the bias cannot be attributed to any single architectural property.

Before retrieval fine-tuning, these models are not perfectly position-neutral at the representation level: encoder models show mild primacy tendencies, while decoder models show recency tendencies (Appendix C). This makes the test stricter: a data-driven effect should appear despite different initial tendencies, and in some configurations must reverse them.

- 3.2.2 Controlled Training Configurations Each model is fine-tuned as a dense retriever under four configurations that differ only in the targetposition distribution of training queries, expressed as begin:middle:end ratios. Three concentrated configurations—100:0:0 (begin; MB), 0:100:0 (middle; MM), and 0:0:100 (end; ME)—restrict all queries to a single target position. The uniform

configuration, 33:33:33 (MU), samples evenly across all three target positions.

Table 2: Overview of the eight pretrained models used in controlled fine-tuning. PE denotes positional encoding; Pool denotes the document-pooling strategy; Max Len denotes the maximum input length.

All four configurations are sampled from the δ = 0.3 retained pool using the per-bin budget defined in Section 3.1.4. Each concentrated configuration samples 8,189 examples from its target position in each length bin, yielding 40,945 training examples. The uniform configuration randomly samples 2,729 examples from each target position within each length bin, yielding 40,935 training examples. Thus, the configurations are matched in training scale and document-length distribution up to the integer split required by the uniform setting.

This yields 32 training runs: 8 base models × 4 training configurations. After training, we evaluate each model on position-aware benchmarks to measure how retrieval performance varies across target positions. If bias is data-driven, concentrated configurations should favor their respective target positions, while uniform training should reduce position sensitivity.

### 4 Experimental Setups

#### 4.1 Base Models

Table 2 lists the eight pretrained base models and their architectural properties. On the encoder side, we include BERT-base (Devlin et al., 2019), ModernBERT-base and ModernBERTlarge (Warner et al., 2025), and Longformerbase (Beltagy et al., 2020); on the decoder side, GPT-2-medium (Radford et al., 2019), BLOOM560M (Workshop et al., 2023), TinyLlamaNoPE (Wang et al., 2024), and Qwen3-0.6B (Yang et al., 2025). ModernBERT-base and large share the same architecture at different scales, enabling a within-architecture scale comparison. TinyLlamaNoPE, which lacks positional encoding, tests whether positional encoding is a necessary condition for bias emergence.

#### 4.2 Training Details

All eight models are fine-tuned as bi-encoder retrievers using InfoNCE loss with chunk-aware negatives: each batch is drawn from a single length bin so that all negatives share the same document length as the positive. We avoid hard negative mining, as mining strategies may introduce positiondependent confounds. All hyperparameters are held constant across the four configurations within each model; the only variable is the positional distribution of training data. Full training details are provided in Appendix D.

#### 4.3 Evaluation

We evaluate all trained models on three positionaware benchmarks: SQUAD-POSQ, FINEWEBPOSQ (Zeng et al., 2025), and POSIR (Zeng et al., 2026). Since FINEWEB-POSQ and POSIR contain longer passages, we evaluate these benchmarks only on models with sufficient context length: ModernBERT-base, ModernBERT-large, and Qwen3-0.6B. We additionally evaluate on four BEIR datasets (Thakur et al., 2021)—SciFact, HotpotQA, FEVER, and CLIMATE-FEVER—where the provided annotations allow us to identify the position of evidence, enabling analysis of how the training distributions affect performance under standard retrieval settings.

We report nDCG@10 computed separately for each positional subset (Ebegin, Emid, Eend). To summarize position sensitivity as a single scalar, we adopt the Position Sensitivity Index (PSI) proposed by Zeng et al. (2025):

min(s) max(s)

, where max(s) > 0 (3)

PSI = 1 −

and s = {sbegin,smid,send} are the metric scores across positional subsets. A PSI of 0 indicates perfect positional robustness; higher values indicate greater sensitivity. We interpret PSI alongside mean performance to ensure that low PSI does not merely reflect uniformly poor retrieval.

### 5 Experimental Results

Skewed training distributions induce corresponding retrieval-level positional preferences. Figure 1 shows a consistent directional effect: retrieval performance peaks near the position emphasized during fine-tuning. Begin-trained retrievers (MB) favor early evidence, mid-trained retrievers

(MM) favor middle evidence, and end-trained retrievers (ME) favor later evidence, consistently across all eight base models. In contrast, uniformly trained retrievers (MU) do not exhibit a comparable single-position preference; their position-wise curves are flatter, providing an initial indication that balanced training weakens the learned positional shortcut.

Representative cases illustrate the magnitude of this shift in both short- and long-passage positionaware benchmarks. On SQuAD-PosQ, Qwen30.6B scores 0.672 in the 0–100 position bucket under begin training but 0.415 under end training; in the 500–3120 bucket, the pattern reverses, with end training scoring 0.702 versus 0.407 for begin training. On FineWeb-PosQ, ModernBERTlarge follows the same pattern: when evidence appears at the beginning, the MB scores 0.778, compared with 0.475 for the ME; when evidence appears at the end, the ME scores 0.743, compared with 0.447 for the MB. The pattern also appears in TinyLlama-NoPE, indicating that explicit positional encodings are not required for retrieval-level position bias to emerge.

Overall, these results show that retrieval-level bias direction can be redirected by the positional distribution of fine-tuning data, indicating that architecture alone does not fix the observed bias direction. Appendix E.1 provides an additional mirror-reversal diagnostic that confirms the same directional effect under document reversal.

Position-balanced training reduces sensitivity to answer location. Table 3 shows a consistent pattern across the position-aware benchmarks: the MU is the least sensitive to evidence location. It achieves the lowest PSI for all eight models on SQuAD-PosQ and for all three evaluated models on FineWeb-PosQ, indicating that balanced training produces more stable retrieval performance across positions.

On SQuAD-PosQ, MU reduces PSI by 57–87% relative to the worst skewed configuration for every model. For example, GPT-2-medium drops from 0.592 under begin training to 0.080 under uniform training, Qwen3-0.6B drops from 0.409 under end training to 0.068, and Longformer-base drops from 0.331 under end training to 0.143. The same pattern holds on FineWeb-PosQ: ModernBERT-base drops from 0.476 to 0.108, ModernBERT-large from 0.426 to 0.116, and Qwen3-0.6B from 0.359 to 0.116.

- Table 3: Mean nDCG@10 and Position Sensitivity Index (PSI) across training configurations. The upper block reports SQuAD-PosQ for all eight models; the lower block reports FineWeb-PosQ for models with sufficient context length. Higher is better for nDCG@10; lower is better for PSI. Best values for each model and metric are in bold.

These results show that position-balanced training does not merely move the bias to a different evidence position. Instead, it makes retrieval performance more consistent across positions, so the model is less affected by where the relevant evidence appears.

Position-balanced training reduces sensitivity with competitive retrieval performance. Table 3 shows that the lower PSI of the MU consistently achieves the lowest PSI across position-

aware benchmarks. On SQuAD-PosQ, MU achieves the highest mean nDCG@10 for five of the eight models. For the remaining three models, its gap to the best skewed configuration is marginal (0.004–0.007). The pattern is even clearer

on FineWeb-PosQ, where MU achieves the highest mean nDCG@10 for all three evaluated models. Thus, position-balanced training reduces sensitivity to evidence location while maintaining competitive retrieval performance in this controlled setting.

These results also clarify the limitation of skewed training. A skewed model can perform well when the evidence appears at its trained position, but this gain often comes with larger drops at other positions. In contrast, MU avoids relying on a single evidence location, leading to more stable retrieval across positions competitive retrieval performance.

#### Early-skewed benchmark subsets can favor early-position priors. After evaluating models

BEIR subset MB MM ME MU SciFact 0.351 0.368 0.340 0.393 HotpotQA 0.338 0.192 0.165 0.284 FEVER 0.491 0.164 0.156 0.357 Climate-FEVER 0.153 0.125 0.109 0.154 Average 0.333 0.212 0.193 0.297

- Table 4: BEIR nDCG@10 averaged over all eight models. Best values are in bold; second-best values are underlined. Full results are reported in Table 14.

on controlled position-aware benchmarks, we test whether training-induced positional priors also affect performance under the standard BEIR evaluation setting, where evidence location is not controlled. Figure 9 shows that the four BEIR subsets differ in their evidence-location distributions. HotpotQA and FEVER are strongly concentrated near the beginning, Climate-FEVER is early-skewed but has a longer tail, and SciFact is broader and less early-concentrated.

Table 4 aligns with these distributional patterns. Across the four BEIR subsets and all eight base models, the begin-trained model MB achieves the highest average nDCG@10: 0.333, followed by MU at 0.297, MM at 0.212, and ME at 0.193. The advantage of MB over MU is largest on the most early-skewed subsets, with a gap of +0.134 on FEVER and +0.054 on HotpotQA. In contrast, this advantage disappears when evidence is less concentrated near the beginning: the gap reverses on SciFact and is nearly zero on Climate-FEVER.

These results suggest that standard benchmark scores can partly reflect evidence-location skew. When evaluation data place much of the relevant evidence near the beginning, a model with an earlyposition prior can obtain higher scores even if it is less robust to evidence appearing elsewhere. The BEIR results therefore indicate benchmark-specific gains rather than evidence-location robustness.

### 6 Analyses

Do query-document representations encode positional preference? We first test whether the ranking-level bias observed in Section 5 is reflected in query-document similarity. Following Coelho et al. (2024), we use MS MARCO query-document pairs and relocate the query-relevant evidence to ten uniformly spaced positions within the same document while keeping the remaining content fixed.

Table 5 shows that the highest-similarity position follows the fine-tuning distribution. For both

Uniform training produces a flatter pattern: the peak-to-lowest gap drops to 1.9 for ModernBERTbase and 5.5 for Qwen3-0.6B, much smaller than under the concentrated settings.

These results suggest that positional preference is reflected in query-document embedding similarities. Fine-tuning changes which evidence locations appear most similar to the query, rather than affecting only the final ranking output. Full results for all eight models are provided in Appendix F.

How does fine-tuning affect document representations? We next examine whether the document embedding itself reflects positional preference, independent of any query. For each document, we measure cosine similarity between the full-document embedding and embeddings of its ten equal-length segments. Because this analysis is query-free, it can be applied both before and after retrieval fine-tuning. Figure 3 shows ModernBERTbase and Qwen3-0.6B; full results are in Figure 7.

Before retrieval fine-tuning, the pretrained base models show only mild initial positional tendencies: ModernBERT-base is slightly closer to early segments, while Qwen3-0.6B is nearly flat across segments 1–9, with a final-segment spike likely caused by last-token pooling. After fine-tuning, however, the similarity profiles shift toward the training distribution. In Qwen3-0.6B, begin training raises similarity to segment 1 while lowering later non-final segments, end training reverses this pattern, and uniform training compresses the profile across positions. ModernBERT-base shows the same qualitative trend.

- Figure 3: Mean cosine similarity between full-document embeddings and segment embeddings (p1–p10) for ModernBERT-base and Qwen3-0.6B. Each column corresponds to one of ten equal-length document segments. Full results for all eight models in Figure 7.

These results show that retrieval fine-tuning can reshape document representations, not only querydocument matching scores. Although the base checkpoints may retain weak positional tendencies, retrieval fine-tuning largely redirects them toward the positional distribution of the training data.

These results suggest that the directional effect is not an artifact of a single pooling choice within ModernBERT-base. In this controlled ablation, changing the fine-tuning position distribution has a larger observed effect on retrieval-level bias direction than changing the pooling method.

Does the retrieval-level directional effect depend on pooling strategy? Finally, we examine whether the observed bias direction depends on the pooling strategy. We train ModernBERT-base under the same four positional training distributions using CLS, mean, max, and last-token pooling.

Figure 2 shows that, in this ModernBERT-base ablation, pooling changes absolute retrieval performance but the observed retrieval-level preference remains aligned with the fine-tuning position distribution. Across the four pooling choices tested, position-skewed training leads models to favor the corresponding positions on both SQuAD-PosQ and FineWeb-PosQ. Uniform training again yields a more position-balanced pattern.

### 7 Conclusion

We trained eight architecturally diverse dense retrievers on synthetic position-targeted data and found that skewed fine-tuning distributions induce corresponding ranking-level positional preferences. Representation analyses further suggest that finetuning can shift document embeddings toward emphasized evidence positions, while model-specific tendencies remain. Position-balanced training reduces positional sensitivity by 57–87% on controlled position-aware benchmarks with competitive retrieval performance, identifying trainingposition distribution as a major controllable factor for mitigating retrieval-level position bias.

### Limitations

This study focuses on a synthetic, position-targeted fine-tuning setting built from English Wikipedia with LLM-generated queries. Although we match training scale and document-length distributions across configurations, beginning-, middle-, and end-targeted examples use different target segments and generated queries. Thus, physical position may remain partially entangled with segment content, discourse role, query semantics, and difficulty. Our results should therefore be interpreted as evidence that training-position distributions strongly influence retrieval-level bias, not as proof that physical position alone is the sole cause.

Our retained pool is filtered by multiplee rankers and checked with a held-out model-based LLM audit, but it is not human-annotated. Residual labeling errors or verifier-induced biases may remain. In addition, our experiments use a controlled singleseed setup without hard-negative mining, early stopping, or extensive hyperparameter sweeps, so small mean nDCG differences should be treated as point estimates. Finally, we evaluate retrieval-level behavior on position-aware benchmarks and four evidence-annotated BEIR subsets, but not end-toend RAG or production retrieval systems; future work should test human-validated, multilingual, domain-specific, and downstream settings.

### Ethics Statement

This work constructs synthetic position-targeted retrieval data from English Wikipedia and LLMgenerated queries. We do not collect private user data, conduct human-subject experiments, or infer protected attributes. However, because Wikipedia contains articles about real individuals, organizations, and sensitive topics, derived examples may include public names or sensitive or offensive content from the source corpus. The artifacts are intended for research on retrieval robustness and position-aware evaluation, not for deployment decisions about individuals or groups. Any released data or code will document the source data, licenses or terms of use, intended use, and known limitations.

### A Qwen3-Embedding Style Query Generation

We adopt a two-stage generation pipeline following Zhang et al. (2025). Stage 1 selects a shared configuration (persona, difficulty, query length) for each document, and Stage 2 generates positionconditioned query–answer pairs using that configuration. For each document, the persona candidate set is retrieved from PersonaHub (Ge et al., 2025) by embedding similarity using BGE-M3 (top-k=20). Both stages use GPT-4o-mini with temperature T=1.0 and top-p=1.0.

- A.1 Prompt for Configuration Selection (Stage 1)

Given a document and a set of candidate personas, the model selects the most appropriate generation configuration. This configuration is shared across all three positional queries for the same document to keep persona, difficulty, and query length fixed across target positions. Here, {CHARACTERS} contains the 20 retrieved personas, each on a separate line. If any field fails to parse, the document is excluded from downstream processing.

- A.2 Prompt for Position-Conditioned Query Generation (Stage 2)

For each document–position pair, the model generates a query–answer pair using the shared configuration from Stage 1. The model receives both the full document and the target segment, and is instructed to produce a query answerable only from the target segment. The positional constraint is enforced at the prompt level but is not guaranteed by the generator. Generated pairs are subsequently validated through the multi-reranker filtering pipeline described in Section 3.1.3.

Stage 1 user prompt: configuration selection listing options

most appropriate configuration for generating a search query about

this passage. </task> <passage> {PASSAGE} </passage> <instructions> Based on the passage content, select:

- 2. Difficulty: The education level appropriate for understanding this

- 3. Query_Length: The appropriate length for the query

</instructions> <options> Character Candidates: {CHARACTERS} Difficulties: high_school, university,

Query_Lengths: short (under 10 words), medium (10--20 words), long (over 20 words)

</options> Output as JSON: {"Character": "

selected character description", " Difficulty": "selected difficulty",

"Query_Length": "selected length"}

###### Stage 2 user prompt: position-conditioned query generation listing options

SEGMENT within the document. The query should be answerable ONLY by the target

segment, not by other parts of the document. </task> <full_document> {FULL_DOCUMENT} </full_document> <target_segment position="{POSITION}"> {TARGET_SEGMENT} </target_segment> <configuration>

- - Your persona: {CHARACTER}
- - Difficulty level: {DIFFICULTY}
- - Target query length: {QUERY_LENGTH} </configuration> <requirements>
- - Generate a query from your persona's perspective
- - The query MUST require information specifically from the target segment to answer
- - The query should NOT be answerable using only the other parts of the document
- - Match the specified difficulty and length
- - The answer must be directly extractable from the target segment </requirements>

Output as JSON: {"query": "the generated search query", "answer": "the answer extracted from target segment", "reasoning": "brief explanation of why this query targets the specific segment"}

### B Reranker Filtering and Data Quality Audit

This appendix provides additional validation for the multi-reranker filtering step used to construct the position-controlled training data. The goal of this filtering step is to obtain a high-confidence retained pool of candidate examples whose generated queries are grounded in the intended target segment. The retained pool is not used directly as the final training distribution; instead, final training sets are constructed by downsampling within length-position cells, as described in Section 3.1.4.

We first define the consensus margin used for threshold analysis, then report filtering statistics under different margin thresholds. We next validate the retained candidates with an independent segment-wise LLM audit. Finally, we summarize how the final δ = 0.3 training sets are sampled from the retained pool.

#### B.1 Consensus Margin for Threshold Analysis

Section 3.1.3 defines the multi-reranker position verification using a margin threshold δ. For thresh-

old analysis, we summarize the same filtering rule with a scalar consensus margin. For a candidate example with query q, document d, and intended target position t, we define

mcons(q,d,t) = min R∈R

R(q,st) − max

R(q,su) ,

u̸=t

where R is the set of three rerankers and u ̸= t ranges over the two non-target positions.

The consensus margin is the smallest target-vsnon-target score gap among the three rerankers. A candidate passes margin threshold δ if and only if mcons(q,d,t) ≥ δ. Thus, mcons ≥ 0 means that all three rerankers rank the target segment above both non-target segments, while larger thresholds require stronger agreement that the query is grounded in the intended target segment.

We refer to candidates with mcons ≥ 0 as nonfailing candidates. The final training sets use the retained pool obtained with margin threshold δ = 0.3.

- Table 6: Cumulative multi-reranker filtering statistics for training candidates. Position columns report the number of retained candidates and their share within each thresholded pool. Increasing the margin threshold reduces coverage but requires stronger agreement that the generated query is grounded in the intended target segment.

#### B.2 Filtering Statistics and Retained-Pool Skew

We first quantify how many generated candidates remain under different cumulative margin thresholds. Table 6 reports the number of retained candidates, their fraction among all generated candidates, and the target-position composition of the retained pool.

The final threshold δ = 0.3 retains 481,236 candidates, including 62,904 middle-targeted and 82,682 end-targeted candidates. Although stricter thresholds make the retained pool increasingly begin-skewed, the δ = 0.3 pool still contains enough examples in every target position for controlled sampling.

Together, these statistics show that the δ = 0.3 retained pool is conservative under our modelbased verification criteria and higher-confidence than lower-margin strata, but not position-balanced or length-neutral. We therefore use it only as a source pool for controlled sampling, rather than as the final training distribution.

#### B.3 Segment-Wise LLM Audit

To independently validate that the reranker margin corresponds to segment-exclusive answerability, we conduct a held-out LLM audit. The audit uses a single binary judge prompt: for each candidate example, we pair the query independently with each of the three document segments and ask whether that segment contains the answer. The intended target position is not revealed to the judge. This audit is used only for post-hoc validation and is not part of the training-set construction pipeline.

- Figure 6 shows the exact binary prompt used for

all reported audit results. The reported quantitiesTargetYes, DistractorNo, and Exclusive—are aggregate metrics computed from independent segmentlevel yes/no judgments, not separate prompts.

Segment-level LLM audit prompt

[SYSTEM] You are a precise reading

comprehension evaluator. Given a question and a text segment, determine whether the segment contains the answer to the question.

[USER] Question: {question}

Text: {segment_text}

Does the text above contain the answer to the question? Respond in JSON: {"reasoning": "...", "answer": "yes|no"}

Figure 6: Binary segment-level prompt used for the LLM audit. Each query–segment pair is evaluated independently, and the audit metrics are computed by aggregating the resulting yes/no judgments across the target and non-target segments.

Let P = {begin,middle,end}. For candidate j, let tj ∈ P be the labeled target position. We let Jj,i ∈ {0,1} denote the binary LLM judgment for whether segment sj,i contains the answer to query qj, where Jj,i = 1 indicates yes and Jj,i = 0 indicates no. We also let J¯j,i = 1 − Jj,i, so J¯j,i = 1 means that segment sj,i is judged answerabsent. Let N be the number of audited candidate examples.

- 0.3 ≤ mcons 95.4% 97.0% 90.4%

- Table 7: Segment-wise LLM audit across nonoverlapping consensus-margin strata. Target Yes, Distractor No, and Exclusive are aggregate metrics computed from independent binary yes/no judgments. Exclusive requires the target segment to be judged as containing the answer and both non-target segments to be judged as not containing the answer. Higher values indicate better segment exclusivity.

We report three aggregate metrics:

Here, i ̸= tj ranges over the two nontarget positions. TargetYes measures whether the labeled target segment is judged answercontaining. DistractorNo measures whether the two non-target segments are judged answer-absent. Exclusive is the strictest metric: it requires the target segment to be judged answer-containing and both non-target segments to be judged answerabsent for the same candidate.

Table 7 reports the audit results across nonoverlapping consensus-margin strata. Unlike Table 6, which reports cumulative retained pools, this audit uses disjoint margin ranges so that lowermargin groups are not mixed with candidates that would also pass stricter thresholds. The final δ = 0.3 retained pool corresponds to the highestmargin stratum, mcons ≥ 0.3.

The exclusive rate increases monotonically across higher-margin strata, indicating that the reranker margin is an effective precision-control signal. Reranker-failed candidates have the lowest exclusive rate, while the mcons ≥ 0.3 group has the highest audited exclusivity. Combined with the retained-pool statistics in Table 6, this supports δ = 0.3 as a conservative high-precision setting: it yields the strongest audited segment exclusivity while still leaving enough candidates for controlled training-set construction.

Table 8: Final sampling budget from the δ = 0.3 retained pool. The smallest length-position cell is the 4096–8192 middle cell with 8,189 examples, which sets the per-bin budget for concentrated configurations. The uniform configuration samples 2,729 examples from each target position within each length bin, yielding 40,935 examples in total.

B.4 Final Sampling from the δ = 0.3 Retained Pool

The δ = 0.3 retained pool is used as a highconfidence source pool, not as the final training distribution. As shown above, the retained pool is begin-skewed and retention varies by length bin. To prevent these raw counts from becoming confounding factors, we construct final training sets by downsampling within length-position cells.

Table 8 reports the retained cell sizes and the sampling budget used for the final training configurations. The smallest retained length-position cell is the middle-position cell in the 4096–8192 length bin, which contains 8,189 examples. This cell sets the common per-bin sampling budget for concentrated configurations.

Each concentrated configuration samples 8,189 examples from its target position in each length bin, yielding 40,945 training examples. The uniform configuration samples 2,729 examples from each target position within each length bin, yielding 40,935 training examples. The slight difference in total size comes from the integer split of 8,189 examples into three target positions.

This sampling design prevents the final training sets from inheriting the uneven position and length counts of the retained pool. As a result, comparisons across training configurations are not driven by differences in training size or document-length distribution.

- Figure 7: Full-document–segment cosine similarity for all eight models across ten equal-length document segments. “Base” denotes pretrained base models before retrieval fine-tuning; “MB,” “MM,” “ME,” and “MU” denote retrievers fine-tuned under the corresponding training configuration. Columns p1–p10 denote segment positions.

### C Pre-Existing Positional Tendencies in Pretrained Models

As noted in Section 3.2.1, pretrained models are not strictly position-neutral at the representation level. To quantify these pre-existing positional tendencies, we compute cosine similarity between each fulldocument embedding and the embedding of each of its ten equal-length segments. Figure 7 (“Base” rows, denoting pretrained models before retrieval fine-tuning) reports the results for all eight models. Here, range denotes the maximum minus minimum similarity across the ten document segments.

The base checkpoints show weak, modelspecific tendencies rather than a consistent directional bias. Among encoders, Longformer-base is nearly flat (range 0.003), ModernBERT-base and ModernBERT-large show mild early preference (ranges 0.032 and 0.051), and BERT-base is shallowly U-shaped (range 0.042). Among decoders, GPT-2-medium is also nearly flat (range 0.016). BLOOM-560M, TinyLlama-NoPE, and Qwen3-0.6B show a spike at segment 10. Excluding segment 10, their profiles are almost flat, with ranges of 0.002, 0.008, and 0.024, respectively.

These initial tendencies are much smaller than the changes induced by retrieval fine-tuning. ModernBERT-base’s range increases from 0.032 before fine-tuning to 0.259 under begin training, and Qwen3-0.6B’s range over segments 1–9 increases from 0.024 to 0.125 under begin training and 0.065 under end training. Thus, the main experiments are conservative because the observed bias must arise despite weak, model-specific tendencies already present before fine-tuning.

### D Training Details

Table 9 lists the public base checkpoints used in our controlled fine-tuning experiments. All 32 model configurations are trained using the Sentence Transformers library (Wolf et al., 2020) with identical hyperparameters except for the learning rate, which varies by model scale. Table 10 lists the shared training configuration.

We set the learning rate to 4 × 10−5 for basescale models with fewer than 400M parameters (BERT-base, ModernBERT-base, Longformerbase, GPT-2-medium) and 2 × 10−5 for larger models (ModernBERT-large, BLOOM-560M, TinyLlama-NoPE, Qwen3-0.6B). All runs use the final checkpoint after three epochs with no early stopping or checkpoint selection.

We prepend an instruction prefix to all query inputs at both training and inference time: "query:

" for encoder-only models and "Retrieve a relevant passage: " for decoder-only models. No prefix is applied to document inputs.

Fine-tuning all 32 model configurations took approximately 6 hours on 8 NVIDIA A100-SXM480GB GPUs, or about 48 GPU-hours, excluding data generation, filtering, and evaluation.

### E Additional Experimental Results: PosIR

- Figure 8 reports position-wise nDCG@10 on the PosIR four selected subset domains: Subject Education, News Media, Law Judiciary, and Finance Economics. The same directional pattern observed on SQuAD-PosQ and FineWeb-PosQ also appears on PosIR: begin-trained retrievers (MB) favor earlier evidence, mid-trained retrievers (MM) peak around the middle, and end-trained retrievers (ME) improve toward later evidence. Uniformly trained retrievers (MU) produce a flatter curve, indicating lower sensitivity to the physical location of the reference evidence.

- Table 11 summarizes mean nDCG@10 and PSI.

The MU achieves the highest mean nDCG@10 for all three evaluated long-context models: 0.411 for ModernBERT-base, 0.423 for ModernBERTlarge, and 0.450 for Qwen3-0.6B. It also achieves the lowest PSI for all three models, reducing PSI relative to the worst skewed configuration by 73.5% for ModernBERT-base, 75.4% for ModernBERTlarge, and 55.8% for Qwen3-0.6B.

These results show that the main position-aware findings extend to PosIR. Position-skewed training still induces position-specific preferences, while position-balanced training reduces sensitivity to evidence location with higher mean nDCG@10 on the evaluated PosIR domains.

#### E.1 Mirror-Reversal Diagnostic on PosIR

The original PosIR evaluation measures retrieval performance as a function of the physical position of the reference evidence. As an additional counterfactual diagnostic, we reverse the document order while keeping the query and relevance label fixed. Specifically, each document is divided into five equal contiguous segments and reordered from 1,2,3,4,5 to 5,4,3,2,1.

We stratify queries by the original location of their reference evidence. Front-origin queries are those whose evidence appears in segment 1 or 2; back-origin queries are those whose evidence appears in segment 4 or 5; and mid-origin queries are those whose evidence appears in segment 3. After reversal, front-origin evidence is mirrored to the back, denoted F→B, while back-origin evidence is mirrored to the front, denoted B→F. Mid-origin evidence remains near the middle.

This setup lets us compare the same origin groups before and after their physical position changes. We define the reversal front–back gap as

∆rev = B→F − F→B.

Positive ∆rev indicates that the model performs better when originally back evidence is moved to the front; negative ∆rev indicates that the model performs better when originally front evidence is moved to the back.

- Table 12: Original and mirror-reversed PosIR performance for front- and back-origin queries. Queries are stratified by the original location of their reference evidence. Front-origin queries have evidence in segments 1–2; after reversal, this evidence moves to the back, denoted F→B. Back-origin queries have evidence in segments 4–5; after

reversal, this evidence moves to the front, denoted B→F. MB, MM, and ME denote retrievers trained on begin-, middle-, and end-concentrated configurations, respectively, and U denotes the uniform configuration. We define ∆rev = B→F − F→B, so positive values indicate a preference for evidence currently placed near the front after reversal, while negative values indicate a preference for evidence currently placed near the back.

F Evidence-Moving Analysis Full Results

- Table 13 reports the full position-wise cosine similarity for all eight models under the evidencemoving experiment described in Section 6. The table uses insertion positions p1–p10, where p1 denotes the earliest insertion position and p10 denotes the latest insertion position.

mid-trained Range is 4.7 and the uniform-trained Range is 5.4; this difference is small in absolute terms and both values are much lower than the begin- and end-trained ranges of 23.1 and 21.4 Overall, the uniform setting compresses the peakto-lowest cosine differences and weakens positionspecific preference.

The remaining three models exhibit modelspecific deviations from clean directional alignment. GPT-2-medium shows a persistent lateposition preference: cosine similarity peaks at p10 under the begin-, mid-, and end-trained configurations, suggesting that fine-tuning does not fully redirect this pre-existing or architecture-specific tendence. Under uniform training, however, the peak shifts to p2 and the Range decreases to 6.0. BERT-base aligns with begin and middle training, peaking at p1 under MM, but its end-trained configuration peaks at p6 rather than at p9 or p10, indicating incomplete alignment with the end-trained distribution. TinyLlama-NoPE aligns under begin and end training, peaking at p1 under MB and p10 under ME, but fails to shift under mid-training, where the peak remains at p1.

Five of the eight models—ModernBERT-base, ModernBERT-large, Longformer-base, BLOOM560M, and Qwen3-0.6B—show clear directional alignment with the fine-tuning distribution. In these models, MB models peak at p1, ME models peak at p9 or p10, and MM models peak in the middle range, between p3 and p5. These results indicate that the evidence location preferred in the embedding space generally follows the target-position distribution used during fine-tuning.

Uniform training produces the smallest or nearsmallest Range for all eight models. It yields the smallest Range for BERT-base, ModernBERTbase, ModernBERT-large, Longformer-base, GPT2-medium, TinyLlama-NoPE, and Qwern3-0.6B. The only exception is BLOOM-560M, where the

Table 13: Full evidence-moving cosine similarity across all eight models within each document (p1–p10). Bold marks the highest cosine (peak); underline marks the lowest cosine. Range is the cosine difference between peak and lowest (×103).

These model-specific deviations do not change the ranking-level conclusions in Section 5: across all eight models, position-skewed fine-tuning induces retrieval behavior aligned with the corresponding training-position distribution. Instead, Table 13 shows that the strength and exact embeddinglevel location of this prefernece can vary by architecture, with some models retaining residual positional tendencies even after controlled fine-tuning.
