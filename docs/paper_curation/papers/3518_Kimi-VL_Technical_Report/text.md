ABSTRACT

We present Kimi-VL, an efficient open-source Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) vision-language model (VLM) that offers advanced multimodal reasoning, long-context understanding, and strong agent capabilities—all while activating only 2.8B parameters in its language decoder (Kimi-VL-A3B).

Kimi-VL demonstrates strong performance across challenging domains: as a general-purpose VLM, Kimi-VL excels in multi-turn agent tasks (e.g., OSWorld), matching flagship models. Furthermore, it exhibits remarkable capabilities across diverse challenging vision language tasks, including collegelevel image and video comprehension, OCR, mathematical reasoning, multi-image understanding. In comparative evaluations, it effectively competes with cutting-edge efficient VLMs such as GPT-4omini, Qwen2.5-VL-7B, and Gemma-3-12B-IT, while surpassing GPT-4o in several key domains.

Kimi-VL also advances in processing long contexts and perceiving clearly. With a 128K extended context window, Kimi-VL can process diverse long inputs, achieving impressive scores of 64.5 on LongVideoBench and 35.1 on MMLongBench-Doc. Its native-resolution vision encoder, MoonViT, further allows it to see and understand ultra-high-resolution visual inputs, achieving 83.2 on InfoVQA and 34.5 on ScreenSpot-Pro, while maintaining lower computational cost for common tasks.

Building upon Kimi-VL, we introduce an advanced long-thinking variant: Kimi-VL-Thinking-2506. Developed through long chain-of-thought (CoT) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL), the latest model exhibits strong long-horizon reasoning capabilities (64.0 on MMMU, 46.3 on MMMU-Pro, 56.9 on MathVision, 80.1 on MathVista, 65.2 on VideoMMMU) while obtaining robust general abilities (84.4 on MMBench, 83.2 on V* and 52.8 on ScreenSpot-Pro). With only around 3B activated parameters, it sets a new standard for efficient yet capable multimodal thinking models.

# 1 Introduction

With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence, human expectations for AI assistants have transcended traditional language-only interactions, increasingly aligning with the inherently multimodal nature of our world. To better understand and interact with these expectations, new generations of natively multimodal models, such as GPT4o (OpenAI et al. 2024) and Google Gemini (Gemini Team et al. 2024), have emerged with the capability to seamlessly perceive and interpret visual inputs alongside language processing. Most recently, advanced multimodal models, pioneered by OpenAI o1 series (OpenAI 2024) and Kimi k1.5 (K. Team et al. 2025), have further pushed these boundaries by incorporating deeper and longer reasoning on multimodal inputs, thereby tackling more complex problems in the multimodal domain.

Nevertheless, development in large VLMs in the open-source community has significantly lagged behind their languageonly counterparts, particularly in aspects of scalability, computational efficiency, and advanced reasoning capabilities. While language-only model DeepSeek R1 (DeepSeek-AI, D. Guo, et al. 2025) has already leveraged the efficient and more scalable mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture and facilitated sophisticated long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, most recent open-source VLMs, e.g. Qwen2.5-VL (Bai et al. 2025) and Gemma-3 (Gemma Team et al. 2025), continue to rely on dense architectures and do not support long-CoT reasoning. Early explorations into MoE-based vision-language models, such as DeepSeek-VL2 (Zhiyu Wu et al. 2024) and Aria (D. Li et al. 2024), exhibit limitations in other crucial dimensions. Architecturally, both models still adopt relatively traditional fixed-size vision encoders, hindering their adaptability to diverse visual inputs. From a capability perspective, DeepSeek-VL2 supports only a limited context length (4K), while Aria falls short in fine-grained visual tasks. Additionally, neither of them supports long-thinking abilities. Consequently, there remains a pressing need for an open-source VLM that effectively integrates structural innovation, stable capabilities, and enhanced reasoning through long-thinking.

In light of this, we present Kimi-VL, a vision-language model for the open-source community. Structurally, Kimi-VL consists of our Moonlight (J. Liu et al. 2025a) MoE language model with only 2.8B activated (16B total) parameters, paired with a 400M native-resolution MoonViT vision encoder. In terms of capability, as illustrated in Figure 2, Kimi-VL can robustly handle diverse tasks (fine-grained perception, math, college-level problems, OCR, agent, etc.) across a broad spectrum of input forms (single-image, multi-image, video, long-document, etc.). Specifically, it features the following exciting abilities:

OCR (SPECIAL ASPECT RATIO)

- Figure 3: The model architecture of Kimi-VL and Kimi-VL-Thinking, consisting of a MoonViT that allows nativeresolution images, an MLP projector, and a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) language decoder.

- 1) Kimi-VL is smart: it has comparable text ability against efficient pure-text LLMs; without long thinking, Kimi-VL is already competitive in multimodal reasoning and multi-turn agent benchmarks, e.g., MMMU, MathVista, OSWorld.
- 2) Kimi-VL processes long: it effectively tackles long-context understanding on various multimodal inputs within its 128K context window, far ahead of similar-scale competitors on long video benchmarks and MMLongBench-Doc.
- 3) Kimi-VL perceives clear: it shows all-round competitive ability over existing efficient dense and MoE VLMs in various vision-language scenarios: visual perception, visual world knowledge, OCR, high-resolution OS screenshot, etc.

Furthermore, with long-CoT activation and reinforcement learning (RL), we introduce the long-thinking version of Kimi-VL, Kimi-VL-Thinking, which further substantially improves performance on more complex multimodal reasoning scenarios. Despite its small scale, Kimi-VL-Thinking offers compelling performance on hard reasoning benchmarks (e.g., MMMU, MathVision, MathVista), outperforming many state-of-the-art VLMs with even larger sizes. We further release and improved version of the thinking model, Kimi-VL-Thinking-2506. The improved version has even better performance on these reasoning benchmarks while retaining or improving on common visual perception and understanding scenarios, e.g. high-resolution perception (V*), OS grounding, video and long document understanding.

# 2 Approach

### 2.1 Model Architecture

The architecture of Kimi-VL consists of three parts: a native-resolution vision encoder (MoonViT), an MLP projector, and an MoE language model, as depicted in Figure 3. We introduce each part in this section.

MoonViT: A Native-resolution Vision Encoder We design MoonViT, the vision encoder of Kimi-VL, to natively process images at their varying resolutions, eliminating the need for complex sub-image splitting and splicing operations, as employed in LLaVA-OneVision (B. Li et al. 2024). We incorporate the packing method from NaViT (Dehghani et al. 2023), where images are divided into patches, flattened, and sequentially concatenated into 1D sequences. These

- Figure 4: The pre-training stages of Kimi-VL consume a total of 4.4T tokens after text-only pre-training of its language model. To preserve text abilities, all stages that update the language model are joint training stages.

preprocessing operations enable MoonViT to share the same core computation operators and optimization as a language model, such as the variable-length sequence attention mechanism supported by FlashAttention (Dao et al. 2022), ensuring non-compromised training throughput for images of varying resolutions.

MoonViT is initialized from and continually pre-trained on SigLIP-SO-400M (Zhai et al. 2023), which originally employs learnable fixed-size absolute positional embeddings to encode spatial information. While we interpolate these original position embeddings to better preserve SigLIP’s capabilities, these interpolated embeddings become increasingly inadequate as image resolution increases. To address this limitation, we incorporate 2D rotary positional embedding (RoPE) (J. Su et al. 2023) across the height and width dimensions, which improves the representation of fine-grained positional information, especially in high-resolution images. These two positional embedding approaches work together to encode spatial information for our model and seamlessly integrate with the flattening and packing procedures. This integration enables MoonViT to efficiently process images of varying resolutions within the same batch. The resulting continuous image features are then forwarded to the MLP projector and, ultimately, to the MoE language model for subsequent training stages. In Kimi-VL-A3B-Thinking-2506, we further continually train this MoonViT to authentically encode up to 3.2 million pixels from a single image, 4 times compared to the original limit.

MLP Projector We employ a two-layer MLP to bridge the vision encoder (MoonViT) and the LLM. Specifically, we first use a pixel shuffle operation to compress the spatial dimension of the image features extracted by MoonViT, performing 2×2 downsampling in the spatial domain and correspondingly expanding the channel dimension. We then feed the pixel-shuffled features into a two-layer MLP to project them into the dimension of LLM embeddings.

Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Language Model The language model of Kimi-VL utilizes our Moonlight model (J. Liu et al. 2025a), an MoE language model with 2.8B activated parameters, 16B total parameters, and an architecture similar to DeepSeek-V3 (DeepSeek-AI, A. Liu, et al. 2025). For our implementation, we initialize from an intermediate checkpoint in Moonlight’s pre-training stage—one that has processed 5.2T tokens of pure text data and activated an 8192-token (8K) context length. We then continue pre-training it using a joint recipe of multimodal and text-only data totaling 2.3T tokens, as detailed in Sec. 2.3.

### 2.2 Muon Optimizer

We use an enhanced Muon optimizer (J. Liu et al. 2025b) for model optimization. Compared to the original Muon optimizer (Jordan et al. 2024), we add weight decay and carefully adjust the per-parameter update scale. Additionally, we develop a distributed implementation of Muon following the ZeRO-1 (Rajbhandari et al. 2020) optimization strategy, which achieves optimal memory efficiency and reduced communication overhead while preserving the algorithm’s mathematical properties. This enhanced Muon optimizer is used throughout the entire training process to optimize all model parameters, including the vision encoder, the projector, and the language model.

### 2.3 Pre-Training Stages

- As illustrated in Figure 4 and Table 1, after loading the intermediate language model discussed above, Kimi-VL’s pre-training comprises a total of 4 stages consuming 4.4T tokens overall: first, standalone ViT training to establish a robust native-resolution visual encoder, followed by three joint training stages (pre-training, cooldown, and long-context activation) that simultaneously enhance the model’s language and multimodal capabilities. The details are as follows.

ViT Training Stages The MoonViT is trained on image-text pairs, where the text components consist of a variety of targets: image alt texts, synthetic captions, grounding bboxes, and OCR texts. The training incorporates two objectives: a SigLIP (Zhai et al. 2023) loss Lsiglip (a variant of contrastive loss) and a cross-entropy loss Lcaption for caption generation conditioned on input images. Following CoCa’s approach (J. Yu et al. 2022), the final loss function is

formulated as L = Lsiglip +λLcaption, where λ = 2. Specifically, the image and text encoders compute the contrastive loss, while the text decoder performs next-token prediction (NTP) conditioned on features from the image encoder. To accelerate training, we initialized both encoders with SigLIP SO-400M (Zhai et al. 2023) weights and implemented a progressive resolution sampling strategy to gradually allow larger size; the text decoder is initialized from a tiny decoder-only language model. During training, we observed an emergence in the caption loss while scaling up OCR data, indicating that the text decoder had developed some OCR capabilities. After training the ViT in the CoCa-alike stage with 2T tokens, we align the MoonViT to the MoE language model using another 0.1T tokens, where only MoonViT and MLP projector are updated. This alignment stage significantly reduces the initial perplexity of MoonViT embeddings in the language model, allowing a smoother joint pre-training stage as follows.

Joint Pre-training Stage In the joint pre-training stage, we train the model with a combination of pure text data (sampled from the same distribution as the initial language model) and a variety of multimodal data (as discussed in Sec. 3.1). We continue training from the loaded LLM checkpoint using the same learning rate scheduler, consuming an additional 1.4T tokens. The initial steps utilize solely language data, after which the proportion of multimodal data gradually increases. Through this progressive approach and the previous alignment stage, we observe that joint pre-training preserves the model’s language capabilities while successfully integrating visual comprehension abilities.

Joint Cooldown Stage The stage following the pre-training stage is a multimodal cooldown phase, where the model is continue trained with high-quality language and multimodal datasets to ensure superior performance. For the language part, through empirical investigation, we observe that the incorporation of synthetic data during the cooling phase yields significant performance improvements, particularly in mathematical reasoning, knowledge-based tasks, and code generation. The general text components of the cooldown dataset are curated from high-fidelity subsets of the pre-training corpus. For math, knowledge, and code domains, we employ a hybrid approach: utilizing selected pre-training subsets while augmenting them with synthetically generated content. Specifically, we leverage existing mathematical knowledge and code corpora as source material to generate question-answer (QA) pairs through a proprietary language model, implementing rejection sampling techniques to maintain quality standards (Yue, Qu, et al. 2023; D. Su et al. 2024). These synthesized QA pairs undergo comprehensive validation before being integrated into the cooldown dataset. For the multimodal part, in addition to the two strategies as employed in text cooldown data preparation, i.e. question-answer synthesis and high-quality subset replay, to allow more comprehensive visual-centric perception and understanding (B. Li et al. 2024; Tong et al. 2024; J. Guo et al. 2024), we filter and rewrite a variety of academic visual or vision-language data sources to QA pairs. Unlike post-training stages, these language and multimodal QA pairs in the cooldown stage are only included for activating specific abilities and henceforth facilitating learning high-quality data, thus, we keep their ratio at a low portion to avoid overfitting these QA patterns. The joint cooldown stage significantly improves both language and multimodal abilities of the model.

Joint Long-context Activation Stage In the final pre-training stage, we extend the context length of the model from 8192 (8K) to 131072 (128K), with the inverse frequency of its RoPE (J. Su et al. 2023) embeddings reset from 50,000

to 800,000. The joint long-context stage is conducted in two sub-stages, where each one extends the model’s context length by four times. For data composition, we filter and upsample the ratio of long data to 25% in each sub-stage, while using the remaining 75% tokens to replay shorter data in its previous stage; our exploration confirms that this composition allows the model to effectively learn long-context understanding while maintaining short-context ability.

To allow the model to activate long-context abilities on both pure-text and multimodal inputs, the long data used in Kimi-VL’s long-context activation consists of not only long text, but also long multimodal data, including long interleaved data, long videos, and long documents. Similar as cooldown data, we also synthesize a small portion of QA pairs to augment the learning efficiency of long-context activation. After the long-context activations, the model can pass needle-in-a-haystack (NIAH) evaluations with either long pure-text or long video haystack, proving its versatile long-context ability. We provide the NIAH recall accuracy on various range of context length up to 128K in Table 2.

### 2.4 Post-Training Stages

Joint Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) In this phase, we fine-tune the base model of Kimi-VL with instruction-based fine-tuning to enhance its ability to follow instructions and engage in dialogue, culminating in the creation of the interactive Kimi-VL model. This is achieved by employing the ChatML format (Openai, 2024), which allows for a targeted instruction optimization while maintaining architectural consistency with Kimi-VL. We optimize the language model, MLP projector, and vision encoder using a mixture of pure-text and vision-language SFT data, which will be described in Sec 3.2. Supervision is applied only to answers and special tokens, with system and user prompts being masked. The model is exposed to a curated set of multimodal instruction-response pairs, where explicit dialogue role tagging, structured injection of visual embeddings, and preservation of cross-modal positional relationships are ensured through the format-aware packing. Additionally, to guarantee the model’s comprehensive proficiency in dialogue, we incorporate a mix of multimodal data and pure text dialogue data used in Moonlight, ensuring its versatility across various dialogue scenarios.

We first train the model at the sequence length of 32k tokens for 1 epoch, followed by another epoch at the sequence length of 128k tokens. In the first stage (32K), the learning rate decays from 2×10−5 to 2×10−6, before it re-warmups to 1×10−5 in the second stage (128K) and finally decays to 1×10−6. To improve training efficiency, we pack multiple training examples into each single training sequence.

Long-CoT Supervised Fine-Tuning With the refined RL prompt set, we employ prompt engineering to construct a small yet high-quality long-CoT warmup dataset, containing accurately verified reasoning paths for both text and image inputs. This approach resembles rejection sampling (RS) but focuses on generating long-CoT reasoning paths through prompt engineering. The resulting warmup dataset is designed to encapsulate key cognitive processes that are fundamental to human-like reasoning, such as planning, where the model systematically outlines steps before execution; evaluation, involving critical assessment of intermediate steps; reflection, enabling the model to reconsider and refine its approach; and exploration, encouraging consideration of alternative solutions. By performing a lightweight SFT on this warm-up dataset, we effectively prime the model to internalize these multimodal reasoning strategies. As a result, the fine-tuned long-CoT model demonstrates improved capability in generating more detailed and logically coherent responses, which enhances its performance across diverse reasoning tasks.

Reinforcement Learning To further advance the model’s reasoning abilities, we then train the model with reinforcement learning (RL), enabling the model to autonomously generate structured CoT rationales. Specifically, similar as Kimi k1.5 (K. Team et al. 2025), we adopt a variant of online policy mirror descent as our RL algorithm, which iteratively refines the policy model πθ to improve its problem-solving accuracy. During the i-th training iteration, we treat the current model as a reference policy model and optimize the following objective, regularized by relative entropy

to stabilize policy updates:

[r(x,y,y∗)] − τKL(πθ(x)||πθ

(x)) , (1)

E(x,y∗)∼D E(y,z)∼π

where r is a reward model that justifies the correctness of the proposed answer y for the given problem x, by assigning a value r(x,y,y∗) ∈ {0,1} based on the ground truth y∗, and τ > 0 is a parameter controlling the degree of regularization.

Each training iteration begins by sampling a problem batch from the dataset D, and the model parameters are updated to θi+1 using the policy gradient derived from (1), with the optimized policy model subsequently assuming the role of reference policy for the subsequent iteration. To enhance RL training efficiency, we implement a length-based reward to penalize excessively long responses, mitigating the overthinking problem where the model generates redundant reasoning chains. Besides, we employ two sampling strategies including curriculum sampling and prioritized sampling, which leverage difficulty labels and per-instance success rates to focus training effort on the most pedagogically valuable examples, thereby optimizing the learning trajectory and improving training efficiency.

Through large-scale reinforcement learning training, we can derive a model that harnesses the strengths of both basic prompt-based CoT reasoning and sophisticated planning-enhanced CoT approaches. During inference, the model maintains standard autoregressive sequence generation, eliminating the deployment complexities associated with specialized planning algorithms that require parallel computation. Simultaneously, the model develops essential metareasoning abilities including error detection, backtracking, and iterative solution refinement by effectively utilizing the complete history of explored reasoning paths as contextual information. With endogenous learning from its complete reasoning trace history, the model can effectively encode planned search procedures into its parametric knowledge.

### 2.5 Infrastructure

Storage We utilize S3 (Amazon Web Services 2023) compatible object storage from cloud service vendors to store our visual-text data. To minimize the time between data preparation and model training, we store visual data in its original format and have developed an efficient and flexible data loading system. This system provides several key benefits:

- • Supports on-the-fly data shuffling, mixing, tokenization, loss masking and packing during training, allowing us to adjust data proportions as needed;
- • Enables random augmentation of both visual and text data, while preserving the correctness of 2D coordinate and orientation information during transformations;
- • Ensures reproducibility by strictly controlling random states and other states across different data loader workers, guaranteeing that any interrupted training can be resumed seamlessly—the data sequence after resumption remains identical to an uninterrupted run;
- • Delivers high-performance data loading: through multiple caching strategies, our system reliably supports training on large scale clusters while maintaining controlled request rates and throughput to the object storage.

Additionally, to ensure consistent dataset quality control, we developed a centralized platform for data registration, visualization, compiling statistics, synchronizing data across cloud storage systems, and managing dataset lifecycles.

Parallelism We adopt a 4D parallelism strategy—Data Parallelism (S. Li et al. 2020), Expert Parallelism (Fedus et al. 2022), Pipeline Parallelism (Y. Huang et al. 2019; Narayanan et al. 2021), and Context Parallelism (Jacobs et al. 2023; H. Liu et al. 2023)—to accelerate the speed of Kimi-VL . After optimizing parallel strategies, the resulting training throughput of our model is around 60% higher than a 7B dense VLM (e.g. VLMs based on Qwen2.5-7B).

- • Data Parallelism (DP). DP replicates the model across multiple devices, each processing different micro-batches. This setup allows larger effective batch sizes by simply increasing the number of devices.
- • Expert Parallelism (EP). EP distributes expert modules in the MoE layer across multiple devices. When combined with DP, experts on a given device can handle tokens from different DP groups, enhancing computational efficiency.
- • Pipeline Parallelism (PP). PP splits the model into multiple layer-based stages. To minimize pipeline bubbles, we allocate the Vision Tower (VT) and several decoder layers to the first stage, place the output layer and additional decoder layers in the last stage, and distribute the remaining decoder layers evenly across intermediate stages based on their time overhead.
- • Context Parallelism (CP). CP addresses long-sequence training by splitting sequences across different CP ranks in conjunction with flash attention (Dao et al. 2022). This substantially reduces peak memory usage and relieves the memory pressure from attention computations.

###### Response

<Think>Alright, I need to figure out who this manuscript belongs to and what it records based on the images provided. Let's start by analyzing the images carefully.

Please infer step by step who this manuscript belongs to and what it records

First, I'll look at the visual characteristics of the manuscript. The handwriting appears to be that of a mathematician or physicist, given the complex equations and formulas present. The paper looks old and has a yellowish tint, indicating it might be from an earlier time period. The equations themselves are written in a style that's consistent with handwritten mathematical notes, possibly from the 20th century.

[Figure 26]

Next, I'll examine the content of the manuscripts. Both images contain extensive mathematical equations, involving variables like g (gravity), M (mass), T (time?), and various indices and summations. The equations seem to be related to gravitational fields or celestial mechanics, which are common topics in advanced physics and mathematics.

Looking at the first image (Image 1), I can see equations involving partial derivatives and summations, which are typical in field theory or tensor calculus. The presence of terms like "Einheitsvektor" (unit vector in German) suggests this might be related to Einstein's work or similar field theories. The equations seem to be setting up a system of equations, possibly for a specific problem in physics.

The second image (Image 2) contains more numerical calculations and formulas. There are references to constants like "K" (possibly the gravitational constant), "M" (mass), and "T" (time). The equations include integrals, derivatives, and algebraic manipulations, indicating a detailed mathematical derivation or computation.

Now, considering the writing style and the content, I notice that the handwriting is somewhat messy but consistent, suggesting it's from a single author. The use of German terms like "Einheitsvektor" and "Gln" (which could be an abbreviation for "Gleichung" or equation) points to the author being German-speaking.

The first image seems to be a page from a mathematical manuscript, possibly from Einstein's work, given the style and content. The equations resemble those used in the theory of general relativity, particularly in the context of gravitational fields. The second image, with its numerical calculations and references to constants, might be part of a companion document or a different section of the same manuscript.

Putting this together, the manuscripts likely belong to Albert Einstein, given the style of the equations and the content related to gravitational fields and field theory. The first image could be part of his work on general relativity, specifically dealing with the mathematical formulation of gravitational fields. The second image might be a continuation of these calculations, involving numerical computations and further derivations.

To verify, I'll consider the following points:

- 1. The presence of German terms suggests a German-speaking author, which aligns with Einstein's background.
- 2. The complex mathematical content matches Einstein's known work in field theory and general relativity.
- 3. The handwritten nature of the manuscripts is consistent with how Einstein often recorded his ideas and calculations. Given these observations, I conclude that the manuscripts belong to Albert Einstein and record his work on gravitational field equations and related mathematical derivations, possibly from his research on general relativity or a related field in physics.</Think>

[Figure 27]

The manuscripts in the images belong to Albert Einstein, a renowned physicist known for his contributions to the theory of general relativity. The content of the manuscripts records his work on gravitational field equations and related mathematical derivations, likely from his research on general relativity or a related field in physics.

###### Key Observations:

- 1. Handwriting Style: The handwriting is consistent with Einstein's known style, characterized by careful, albeit slightly messy, mathematical notation.
- 2. Content Analysis:

- - The equations involve terms like partial derivatives, summations, and Greek letters (e.g., γ, g), which are typical in tensor calculus and field theory.
- - The first image shows equations that resemble Einstein's formulation of gravitational field equations, possibly related to the Einstein field equations in general relativity.
- - The second image includes numerical calculations, constants (e.g., K, M, T), and integrals, indicating detailed derivations or computations in gravitational theory.

- 3. German Terms: The presence of German terms like "Einheitsvektor" (unit vector) and "Gln" (equation) suggests Einstein, who was German-speaking.

Conclusion: These manuscripts are part of Einstein's research materials, documenting his mathematical and theoretical work on gravitational fields and field equations. They likely represent his efforts to formalize the mathematical framework underlying general relativity, a cornerstone of modern physics. Final Answer: The manuscripts belong to Albert Einstein and record his work on gravitational field equations and mathematical derivations in general relativity.

In this example, our model identifies the author as Albert Einstein based on handwriting style, content analysis, and language cues. It reasons that the manuscripts relate to gravitational field equations, consistent with Einstein’s contributions to general relativity.

Beyond these four parallel strategies, we incorporate ZeRO1 (Rajbhandari et al. 2020) and Selective Checkpointing Activation (T. Chen et al. 2016; Korthikanti et al. 2022) to further optimize memory usage. ZeRO1 reduces optimizer state overhead by using a distributed optimizer while avoiding extra communication costs. Selective Checkpointing Activation trades time for space by recomputing only those layers that have low time overhead but high memory consumption, striking a balance between computation efficiency and memory demands. For extremely long sequences, we expand recomputation to a broader set of layers to prevent out-of-memory errors.

# 3 Data Construction

### 3.1 Pre-Training Data

Our multimodal pre-training corpus is designed to provide high-quality data that enables models to process and understand information from multiple modalities, including text, images, and videos. To this end, we have also curated high-quality data from six categories – caption, interleaving, OCR, knowledge, video, and agent – to form the corpus.

When constructing our training corpus, we developed several multimodal data processing pipelines to ensure data quality, encompassing filtering, synthesis, and deduplication. Establishing an effective multimodal data strategy is crucial during the joint training of vision and language, as it both preserves the capabilities of the language model and facilitates alignment of knowledge across diverse modalities.

We provide a detailed description of these sources in this section, which is organized into the following categories:

Caption Data Our caption data provides the model with fundamental modality alignment and a broad range of world knowledge. By incorporating caption data, the multimodal LLM gains wider world knowledge with high learning efficiency. We have integrated various open-source Chinese and English caption datasets like (Schuhmann et al. 2022; Gadre et al. 2024) and also collected substantial in-house caption data from multiple sources. However, throughout the training process, we strictly limit the proportion of synthetic caption data to mitigate the risk of hallucination stemming from insufficient real-world knowledge.

For general caption data, we follow a rigorous quality control pipeline that avoids duplication and maintain high image-text correlation. We also vary image resolution during pre-training to ensure that the vision tower remains effective when processing images of both high- and low-resolution.

Image-text Interleaving Data During the pre-training phase, the model benefits from interleaving data for many aspects. For example, multi-image comprehension ability can be boosted by interleaving data; interleaving data always provides detailed knowledge for the given image; a longer multimodal context learning ability can also be gained by interleaving data. What’s more, we also find that interleaving data can contribute positively to maintaining the model’s language abilities. Thus, image-text interleaving data is an important part in our training corpus. Our multimodal corpus considered open-sourced interleave datasets like (Zhu et al. 2024; Laurençon et al. 2024) and also constructed large-scale in-house data using resources like textbooks, webpages, and tutorials. Further, we also find that synthesizing the interleaving data benefits the performance of multimodal LLM for keeping the text knowledge. To ensure each image’s knowledge is sufficiently studied, for all the interleaving data, despite standard filtering, deduping, and other quality control pipeline, we also integrate a data reordering procedure to keep all the image and text in the correct order.

OCR Data Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is a widely adopted technique that converts text from images into an editable format. In our model, a robust OCR capability is deemed essential for better aligning the model with human values. Accordingly, our OCR data sources are diverse, ranging from open-source to in-house datasets, encompassing both clean and augmented images, and spanning over single-page and multi-page inputs.

In addition to the publicly available data, we have developed a substantial volume of in-house OCR datasets, covering multilingual text, dense text layouts, web-based content, and handwritten samples. Furthermore, following the principles outlined in OCR 2.0 (Wei et al. 2024), our model is also equipped to handle a variety of optical image types, including figures, tables, geometry diagrams, mermaid plots, and natural scene text. We apply extensive data augmentation techniques—such as rotation, distortion, color adjustments, and noise addition—to enhance the model’s robustness. As a result, our model achieves a high level of proficiency in OCR tasks.

In addition to single-page OCR data, we collect and convert a large volume of in-house multi-page OCR data to activate the model’s understanding of long documents in the real world. With the help of these data, our model is capable of performing accurate OCR on a single image but can also comprehend an entire academic paper or a scanned book.

Knowledge Data The concept of multimodal knowledge data is analogous to the previously mentioned text pre-training data, except here we focus on assembling a comprehensive repository of human knowledge from diverse sources to further enhance the model’s capabilities. For example, carefully curated geometry data in our dataset is vital for developing visual reasoning skills, ensuring the model can interpret the abstract diagrams created by humans.

Our knowledge corpus adheres to a standardized taxonomy to balance content across various categories, ensuring diversity in data sources. Similar to text-only corpora, which gather knowledge from textbooks, research papers, and other academic materials, multimodal knowledge data employs both a layout parser and an OCR model to process content from these sources. While we also include filtered data from internet-based and other external resources.

Because a significant portion of our knowledge corpus is sourced from internet-based materials, infographics can cause the model to focus solely on OCR-based information. In such cases, relying exclusively on a basic OCR pipeline may limit training effectiveness. To address this, we have developed an additional pipeline that better captures the purely textual information embedded within images.

Agent Data For agent tasks, the model’s grounding and planning capabilities have been significantly enhanced. In addition to utilizing publicly available data, a platform has been established to efficiently manage and execute virtual machine environments in bulk. Within these virtual environments, heuristic methods were employed to collect screenshots and corresponding action data. This data was then processed into dense grounding formats and continuous trajectory formats. The design of the Action Space was categorized according to Desktop, Mobile, and Web environments. Furthermore, icon data was collected to strengthen the model’s understanding of the meanings of icons within software graphical user interfaces (GUIs). To enhance the model’s planning ability for solving multi-step desktop tasks, a set of computer-use trajectories was collected from human annotators, each accompanied by synthesized Chain-of-Thought (Aguvis (Yiheng Xu et al. 2024)). These multi-step agent demonstrations equip Kimi-VL with the capability to complete real-world desktop tasks (on both Ubuntu and Windows).

Video Data In addition to image-only and image-text interleaved data, we also incorporate large-scale video data during pre-training, cooldown, and long-context activation stages to enable two directions of essential abilities of our model: first, to understand a long-context sequence dominated by images (e.g. hour-long videos) in addition to long text; second, to perceive fine-grained spatio-temporal correspondence in short video clips.

Our video data are sourced from diverse resources, including open-source datasets as well as in-house web-scale video data, and span videos of varying durations. Similarly, to ensure sufficient generalization ability, our video data cover a

wide range of scenes and diverse tasks. We cover tasks such as video description and video grounding, among others. For long videos, we carefully design a pipeline to produce dense captions. Similar to processing the caption data, we strictly limit the proportion of the synthetic dense video description data to reduce the risk of hallucinations.

Text Data Our text pretrain corpus directly utilizes the data in Moonlight J. Liu et al. 2025a, which is designed to provide comprehensive and high-quality data for training large language models (LLMs). It encompasses five domains: English, Chinese, Code, Mathematics & Reasoning, and Knowledge. We employ sophisticated filtering and quality control mechanisms for each domain to ensure the highest quality training data. For all pretrain data, we conducted rigorous individual validation for each data source to assess its specific contribution to the overall training recipe. This systematic evaluation ensures the quality and effectiveness of our diverse data composition. To optimize the overall composition of our training corpus, the sampling strategy for different document types is empirically determined through extensive experimentation. We conduct isolated evaluations to identify document subsets that contribute most significantly to the model’s knowledge acquisition capabilities. These high-value subsets are upsampled in the final training corpus. However, to maintain data diversity and ensure model generalization, we carefully preserve a balanced representation of other document types at appropriate ratios. This data-driven approach helps us optimize the trade-off between focused knowledge acquisition and broad generalization capabilities.

### 3.2 Instruction Data

At this stage, the data is primarily aimed at enhancing the model’s conversational abilities and instruction-following capabilities. To cover as many scenarios as possible, we enrich the data across different domains. For non-reasoning tasks, including chart interpretation, agent grounding, OCR, image-grounded conversations, question-answering, writing, and text processing, we initially construct a seed dataset through human annotation. This seed dataset is used to train a seed model. Subsequently, we collect a diverse set of prompts and employ the seed model to generate multiple responses to each prompt. Annotators then rank these responses and refine the top-ranked response to produce the final version. For reasoning tasks like visual coding, visual reasoning, and math/science problems, where rule-based and model-based verifications are more accurate and efficient than human judgment, we utilize rejection sampling to expand the SFT dataset. The complete vanilla SFT dataset comprises approximately a 1:1 ratio of text tokens to image tokens.

### 3.3 Reasoning Data

Our reasoning data is meticulously constructed for activation and enhancement of the model’s multimodal reasoning capabilities during both the long-CoT supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning stages. Through developing a generation pipeline that resembles rejection sampling (RS) and prompt engineering, we collect and synthesize an amount of high-quality long-CoT data. Specifically, we first assemble a collection of QA data with ground truth annotations that require multi-step reasoning, such as mathematical problem-solving and domain-specific VQA. Subsequently, we sample multiple detailed reasoning trajectories for each question by leveraging a powerful long-CoT model Kimi k1.5 (K. Team et al. 2025) with curated reasoning prompts. In rejection sampling, we feed the true labels and model predictions into an off-the-shelf reward model for judgment. Wrong chain-of-thought responses are filtered out according to the model evaluation as well as some rule-based rewards, thus improving the reasoning data quality.

# 4 Evaluation

We begin by presenting our comprehensive model and conducting a comparative analysis with leading state-of-the-art (SoTA) solutions. Following this introduction, we proceed to assess various sub-capabilities of the model through detailed performance evaluations. This part examines how effectively the model handles different tasks and scenarios, providing insights into its strengths and limitations across diverse functional domains.

### 4.1 Comparison to the State-of-the-Art Models

Which of the four subgraphs in the figure is taken at the same place as subgraph 1?

The first picture (image 1) depicts a dense urban area with a mix of buildings, green spaces, and a distinctive circular structure (possibly a dome or observatory). To determine which sub-picture matches this location:

[Figure 34]

Image 4 shows a similarly dense urban environment with a large building complex featuring a central courtyard and a circular structure resembling the one in image 1. Both images share the same type of urban layout, building density, and green spaces. Image 3 includes a church spire (not present in image 1) and a more spread-out layout, making it distinct. Image 2 is clearly suburban with larger plots and fewer buildings, unlike the compact urban setting of image 1. Conclusion: Image 4 is the most likely candidate as it matches the urban density, building types, and the circular structure seen in image 1.

Answer: The fourth sub-picture (image 4) is in the same place as the first picture.

### 4.2 Kimi-VL-A3B-Thinking: A Reasoning Extension of Kimi-VL

Furthermore, we conduct a reasoning extension to empower Kimi-VL to reason with CoT and present a long-thinking version of the model, Kimi-VL-Thinking, through long-CoT activation and reinforcement learning. We validate its superior performance on several image benchmarks, as shown in Table 4.

Kimi-VL-Thinking significantly improves over the base Kimi-VL model, with gains of 2.6% on MathVista, 4.7% on MMMU, and 15.4% on MathVision, demonstrating its capability to leverage test-time computation for deeper reasoning and better handling of complex multimodal queries. In Table 4, Kimi-VL-Thinking further outperforms or rivals state-of-the-art thinking and non-thinking models: achieving 71.3% on MathVista, outperforming GPT-4o (63.8%) and GPT-4o-mini (56.7%); scoring 61.7% on MMMU, surpassing GPT-4o-mini (60.0%) and Qwen2.5-VL-7B (58.6%); and reaching 36.8% on MathVision, exceeding GPT-4o (30.4%) and Gemma-3-27B-IT (35.5%), even QVQ-72B (35.9%). While marginally behind some larger-scale models on select benchmarks, Kimi-VL-Thinking accomplishes these results with only 3B activated parameters—orders of magnitude fewer than its counterparts—underscoring its strong efficiency and effectiveness in multimodal reasoning.

Our Kimi-VL-Thinking model also exhibits strong test-time scaling properties, as shown in Figure 13. Specifically, increasing the max thinking token length at inference time consistently improves test-time accuracy across all three

###### Response

The requirement is to "Teach him the taste of fish and make him hungry." This implies that in addition to teaching someone how to perform a task or acquire a skill, it is also important to inspire and motivate them to continue learning and improving on their own. By making them hungry for more knowledge or experience, they will be more likely to seek out new challenges and opportunities for growth, which can lead to greater success and fulfillment in the long run.

benchmarks. For example, on MathVision, the accuracy rises steadily from 18.7% at 1k tokens to 36.8% at 16k tokens, and similar upward trend is also observed on MMMU, indicating that the model is able to utilize longer reasoning chains for better performance. However, not all benchmarks benefit equally from longer thinking lengths. On MathVista, performance saturates early, with accuracy reaching 70.9% at 4k tokens and no further significant gains observed as the token length increases to 16k. It suggests that for this task, the necessary reasoning depth is already captured within a relatively short context, and additional computation does not yield further improvements.

While Kimi-VL-A3B-Thinking shows excellent thinking abilities on hard reasoning tasks, we further provide the updated Kimi-VL-A3B-Thinking-2506§, a new reasoning variant that is not only smarter, but integrates key abilities of Kimi-VL-A3B-Instruct (perception, video, long-document, and OS-agent abilities) into this thinking model.

Kimi-VL-Thinking-2506 significantly improves reasoning efficiency while reducing token consumption. As shown in Table 4, Kimi-VL-Thinking-2506 achieves 56.9% on MathVision (+20.1% improvement on original Kimi-VL-Thinking), 80.1% on MathVista (+8.4%), 46.3% on MMMU-Pro (+3.2%), and 64.0% on MMMU (+2.1%), demonstrating nontrivial gains across multiple reasoning benchmarks. Meanwhile, while solving these hard reasoning problems, the 2506 version reduces the average output token length by around 20% (e.g., 2.9K → 2.4K on MMMU-val and 5.8K → 4.4K on MathVision), facilitating it to be more efficient and user-friendly for practical deployments.

§Tech Blog: https://huggingface.co/blog/moonshotai/kimi-vl-a3b-thinking-2506

Beyond extensive reasoning tasks, Kimi-VL-Thinking demonstrates stronger visual perception capabilities (Table 5). Compared to the previous non-thinking variant (Kimi-VL-A3B-Instruct), Kimi-VL-A3B-Thinking-2506 achieves competitive or superior results on general multimodal understanding benchmarks: 84.4% on MMBench-EN-v1.1, 70.4% on MMStar, 70.0% on RealWorldQA, and 78.4% on MMVet, underscoring its broader competence in vision-language tasks. In terms of token efficiency, the 2506 version only requires in average 180 tokens per answer when solving MMBench, 1/3 compared to the previous thinking model while improving 8.4% accuracy.

Kimi-VL-A3B-Thinking-2506 also extends its reasoning ability to video and long-context domains. It establishes new state-of-the-art results among open-source models on VideoMMMU (65.2%, 4% better than GPT-4o), a challenging video reasoning benchmark; it also maintains robust general video understanding performance with 71.9% on VideoMME, matching the long video understanding ability of Kimi-VL-A3B-Instruct. It also scores 42.1% (first open-source model matching GPT-4o) on MMLongBench-Doc (Table 5), a 10% improvement over the previous thinking model and

- 7% over the previous instruct model, demonstrating its robust ability on broader long-form visual inputs.

As mentioned in the method part, the continual training on MoonViT (3.2 million max input pixels) of Kimi-VLA3B-Thinking-2506 leads to substantial improvements on high-resolution perception and OS grounding benchmarks, achieving 83.2% on V* Benchmark (without external tools), 52.8% on ScreenSpot-Pro, and 52.5% on OSWorld-G (full set with refusal samples), showing huge improvements over both previous variants. We hope that this high-resolution multimodal reasoning model brings about interesting new capabilities in the real world.

# 5 Conclusion, Limitation, and Future Work

We introduce Kimi-VL, a VLM designed with a balanced approach to cover both multimodal and text-only pretraining/post-training, underpinned by an MoE-based architecture for scalable efficiency. Its 128K extended context window enables precise retrieval in lengthy texts and videos, while the native-resolution encoder MoonViT helps maintain high accuracy with low computational overhead in ultra-high-resolution visual tasks. Additionally, Kimi-VL-Thinking facilitates effective long-chain reasoning in complex image and video inference. Overall, Kimi-VL demonstrates robust adaptability and efficiency across multimodal, long-context, and high-resolution tasks, indicating substantial potential for future research and industrial applications.

However, Kimi-VL still faces several challenges:

- 1. Although the current model size performs effectively for many standard tasks, it remains too limited to address highly specialized or domain-specific problems, or problems that are strongly dependent on language abilities, restricting Kimi-VL’s ability to handle extremely complex scenarios.
- 2. While the reasoning capability is already strong for typical use cases, it has yet to reach its theoretical upper bound, particularly for intricate tasks requiring multi-step inference or deeper contextual understanding.
- 3. Despite providing a 128K extended context window, due to limited parameters in its attention layers (which is only comparable to a 3B model), its long-context abilities is still insufficient for certain advanced applications that involve extremely long sequences or high-volume contextual information.

In the future, we will tackle these challenges by scaling up the model size, expanding pre-training data, and enhancing post-training algorithms. Our next steps include optimizing Kimi-VL and releasing larger versions, as well as refining post-training and test-time scaling mechanisms for a better thinking model. These efforts will pave the way for more advanced applications in both research and industry.

# B Evaluation Details

### B.1 Image Benchmark

MMMU (Yue, Ni, et al. 2024) encompasses a carefully curated collection of 11.5K multimodal questions sourced from college exams, quizzes, and textbooks. These questions span six major academic fields: Art & Design, Business, Science, Health & Medicine, Humanities & Social Science, and Tech & Engineering.

MMBench-EN-v1.1 (Yuan Liu et al. 2023) is a fine-grained benchmark that contains 2974 multiple-choice questions, covering 20 ability dimensions. It incorporate perception and reasoning as the top-level ability dimensions in its ability taxonomy, leading to different levels of evaluation in various ability dimensions.

MMStar (Lin Chen et al. 2024) is an elite vision-indispensable multimodal benchmark comprising 1,500 challenge samples meticulously selected by humans. It is designed to benchmark 6 core capabilities and 18 detailed axes, aiming to evaluate the multimodal capacities of LVLMs with a carefully balanced and purified selection of samples.

MMVet (W. Yu et al. 2024) is designed based on the insight that the intriguing ability to solve complicated tasks is often achieved by a generalist model being able to integrate different core vision-language capabilities. It defines 6 core VL capabilities and examines the 16 integrations of interest derived from the capability combination.

RealWorldQA (x.ai 2024) is a benchmark designed to evaluate the real-world spatial understanding capabilities of multimodal models. It assesses how well the models comprehend physical environments.
