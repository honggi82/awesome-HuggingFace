Abstract—Online policy learning directly in the physical world is a promising yet challenging direction for embodied intelligence. Unlike simulation, real-world systems cannot be arbitrarily accelerated, cheaply reset, or massively replicated, which makes scalable data collection, heterogeneous deployment, and longhorizon effective training difficult. These challenges suggest that real-world policy learning is not only an algorithmic issue but fundamentally a systems problem. We present USER, a Unified and extensible SystEm for Real-world online policy learning. USER treats physical robots as first-class hardware resources alongside GPUs through a unified hardware abstraction layer, enabling automatic discovery, management, and scheduling of heterogeneous robots. To address cloud–edge communication, USER introduces an adaptive communication plane with tunnelingbased networking, distributed data channels for traffic localization, and streaming-multiprocessor-aware weight synchronization to regulate GPU-side overhead. On top of this infrastructure, USER organizes learning as a fully asynchronous framework with a persistent, cache-aware buffer, enabling efficient long-horizon experiments with robust crash recovery and reuse of historical data. In addition, USER provides extensible abstractions for rewards, algorithms, and policies, supporting online imitation or reinforcement learning of CNN/MLP, generative policies, and large vision–language–action (VLA) models within a unified pipeline. Results in both simulation and the real world show that USER enables multi-robot coordination, heterogeneous manipulators, edge–cloud collaboration with large models, and longrunning asynchronous training, offering a unified and extensible systems foundation for real-world online policy learning.

platforms are heterogeneous, networks are unstable, and experiments are long-running and frequently interrupted [17]. These properties make real-world online policy learning not merely an algorithmic challenge, but a systems problem that tightly couples physical execution, communication, and optimization.

Several system-level challenges limit scalable real-world learning. First, robots are often treated as external environments, which makes it hard to jointly schedule robots and accelerators in distributed deployments. Second, real-world online learning increasingly relies on cloud–edge infrastructures, particularly for large-scale VLA models, with rollout at the edge and training in the cloud. These components span heterogeneous and isolated network domains, causing bandwidth asymmetry and cross-domain latency [7]. Moreover, the physical world cannot be accelerated, making data efficiency the main bottleneck. Synchronous pipelines commonly used in simulation therefore result in poor learning

I. INTRODUCTION

A common paradigm in embodied intelligence is to train policies in simulation and then deploy them in the real world [25, 23]. However, unavoidable gaps in dynamics, sensing, and interaction often cause policies to degrade significantly after transfer [11, 25]. This has motivated increasing interest in learning policies directly in the physical world. Unlike simulation, real-world online learning cannot be arbitrarily accelerated, reset, or replicated. Robots operate in real time,

efficiency [3]. Third, embodied learning is moving toward data-driven training with high-dimensional visual streams and long horizons, which greatly increase data volume and experiment duration. However, existing buffers and pipelines remain memory-centric and short-lived, lacking support for persistence, recovery, and cross-stage data reuse [26].

These challenges call for rethinking real-world robot learning from a systems perspective. Practical physical-world learning should not rely solely on isolated algorithmic advances, but instead require unified abstractions and extensible infrastructure. In this paper, we present USER, a Unified and extensible SystEm for online Real-world policy learning.

At the system level, USER brings physical robots into the same abstraction layer as GPUs and other accelerators, allowing robots to participate as first-class hardware resources in distributed learning. With this unified hardware abstraction, heterogeneous robots can be automatically discovered, uniformly managed, and flexibly scheduled together with computing devices for diverse learning workloads. At scale, real-world learning further faces severe communication challenges across cloud–edge domains. USER addresses this with an adaptive communication plane that enables cross-domain connectivity via tunneling-based cloud–edge networking. To cope with bandwidth asymmetry, USER introduces distributed data channels to localize traffic and reduce unnecessary cross-domain transfers, and employs streaming multiprocessor(SM)-aware weight synchronization to regulate GPU-side communication overhead during training.

Beyond system architecture, USER organizes the real-world policy learning as a fully asynchronous learning framework, in which data generation, training, data transmission, and weight synchronization proceed independently rather than through tightly synchronized stages. To support long-horizon and data-intensive learning, USER introduces a persistentcache-aware buffer that enables streaming trajectory ingestion, recovery, and reuse across training phases. Unlike traditional memory-centric pipelines, this design allows experiments to run robustly for days or weeks, even under network fluctuations, robot resets, or temporary training pauses. On top of this framework, USER provides extensible abstractions for policies, algorithms, and rewards. Rewards can be specified via rules, human feedback, or learned reward models, while policies range from conventional CNN/MLP controllers to flow-based generative policies and large VLA models, and support both imitation and reinforcement learning algorithms. Together, USER enables researchers to explore diverse realworld learning paradigms without re-engineering the underlying system infrastructure.

Our contributions are summarized as follows:

- • A unified hardware abstraction that treats physical robots as first-class resources alongside accelerators, enabling automatic discovery, management, and scheduling of heterogeneous robots for real-world policy learning.
- • An adaptive communication plane with tunneling-based networking, distributed data channels, and SM-aware synchronization to support stable and efficient data exchange

- across heterogeneous and isolated network domains.
- • A fully asynchronous learning framework with a persistent and cache-aware buffer that supports streaming long-horizon data ingestion, recovery, and reuse beyond memory-centric pipelines.
- • Extensible abstractions for rewards, algorithms, and policies within a unified execution and data pipeline, enabling online imitation and reinforcement learning of CNN/MLP, generative, and large VLA policies in realworld settings.
- • An open-source implementation of USER that provides a reusable systems foundation for real-world online policy learning.

II. RELATED WORK

- A. Robot Learning Systems

The rapid progress of embodied intelligence has been driven by high-parallel simulators [19, 20, 29] and large-scale learning frameworks [21, 15, 10, 27]. However, these systems are simulation-centric and rely on synchronous pipelines. In realworld learning, the physical environment cannot be accelerated, making data efficiency the bottleneck and synchronous execution inefficient. To address this, USER adopts a fully asynchronous pipeline that lets robots execute continuously while learning runs in parallel. Beyond asynchrony, scaling real-world learning requires multi-robot parallelism with proper abstraction and communication. ROS2 [18] and Zenoh [6] offer connectivity but limited learning orchestration, while systems such as SERL [17] and Qt-Opt [13] mainly support single-robot or small-model settings.

We introduce a unified hardware abstraction that treats robots as first-class resources alongside accelerators, enabling discovery, scheduling, and management of heterogeneous robots for large-scale policy learning. On top of this, USER builds an adaptive cloud–edge communication plane for stable cross-domain training with large models. Compared with SOP [22], which targets homogeneous robots, USER emphasizes unified access to heterogeneous robots and a persistent, cacheaware buffer for long-horizon learning.

- B. Data Management for Long-Horizon Learning

High-performance, memory-centric replay buffers, exemplified by Reverb [5] and Flashbax [24], leverage volatile RAM to achieve extreme sampling throughput. However, this reliance on memory constrains their ability to support the management requirements of real-world policy learning systems characterized by long-horizon and massive visual data, particularly with the emergence of VLA models. While recent works such as LeRobot Dataset v3.0 [4] have attempted to facilitate efficient streaming access to static datasets via metadata, the systematic handling of large-scale dynamic data during active policy learning remains unresolved. To address this gap, USER proposes a persistence-cache-aware buffer that maintains high-throughput sampling capabilities while supporting asynchronous disk persistence, enabling arbitrarily large datasets with efficient revisiting of historical data, as

of robots and GPUs, to maximize flexibility in deployment. In USER, we typically deploy three types of nodes: rollout nodes equipped with GPUs for policy inference, robot nodes running on CPU-only machines for action execution at the edge, and training nodes with large-scale accelerators for centralized training. Nodes can be organized into node groups to capture this heterogeneity, where each group contains homogeneous hardware units, and a node may belong to multiple groups, depending on its hardware composition. In this manner, hardware scheduling policies can reason over homogeneous pools while still supporting a heterogeneous cluster.

Hardware Registration and Discovery. The HAL uses a pluggable checker interface to register and extend new hardware. Each hardware type supplies a HAL checker that defines (i) its type identifier, (ii) how to discover the hardware on a node, and (iii) what metadata is attached to each instance. This modularity isolates device-specific logic (GPU vendor tooling, robot connectivity checks, sensor discovery) from the rest of the system. At cluster initialization, USER constructs a global hardware inventory by launching a lightweight hardware probe process on each node and invoking the registered HAL checkers to discover available hardware. This discovery can either be automatic (typically for PCIe- or USB-connected devices like GPUs, cameras and space mouse), or configuration-driven (typically for IP-bound robots) due to the need for explicit bindings and safety checks. For physical robots, discovery includes optional validation like network reachability, presence of required cameras, and basic health checks, ensuring that only usable robots enter the schedulable pool. The resulting inventory exposes for each node the available units and their ranks, forming the substrate for subsequent scheduling.

III. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE DESIGN

With the emergence of real-world policy learning in embodied intelligence, supporting multi-robot and heterogeneous deployments becomes essential. The system architecture design of USER aims to provide unified and extensible system support for real-world policy learning over heterogeneous robots and distributed compute resources. At its core, USER virtualizes physical robots and accelerators as first-class, schedulable hardware, and connects them through a robust cloud-edge communication substrate. This design decouples learning logic from physical deployment details, enabling unified resource management, reliable cross-domain networking, and low-latency data exchange across multi-robot, multinode environments, as shown in Fig. 2. Together, the unified hardware abstraction layer and the adaptive communication plane constitute the infrastructure foundation for real-world policy learning in distributed and heterogeneous settings.

Hardware Scheduling. USER schedules robots and accelerators through a single rank-based placement interfaceeach component selects node groups and a set of resource ranks, where ranks resolve to accelerator or robot units within the nodes groups’ nodes. The scheduler then deterministically maps process ranks to these resource ranks (evenly sharing units or assigning multiple units per process) and launches each process with an explicit binding to only its assigned hardware (e.g., constrained visible GPU devices or injected robot endpoint configuration). This uniform mechanism enables heterogeneous placements in one job, such as training on one GPU pool while binding different subsets of rollout processes to different types of robots.

A. Unified Hardware Abstraction Layer

In pursuit of scalable real-world policy learning, the core idea of USER is to treat physical robots as accelerators (e.g., GPUs and TPUs) as first-class hardware resources. To this end, USER abstracts and manages all types of robots and accelerators uniformly as schedulable hardware units in a special hardware abstraction layer (HAL). The HAL provides unified interfaces for extending new types of hardware, automatically discovering available hardware resources, and scheduling hardware for different learning tasks.

B. Adaptive Communication Plane

Node and Hardware Abstraction. USER models a deployment as a cluster of nodes, each exporting a set of hardware units. A hardware unit is the scheduler’s atomic allocatable entity—a single GPU device, or a single physical robot, optionally bundled with its required peripherals such as cameras and a space mouse. Each unit is described by a lightweight, typed descriptor (hardware type and model) and configuration metadata such as robot network identity and sensor bindings. A node is inherently heterogeneous, potentially hosting multiple types of hardware units, like different types

Real-world policy learning runs over cloud–edge distributed compute resources, especially for large-scale VLA models, with rollout and robot nodes at the edge and training nodes in the cloud. USER’s adaptive communication plane addresses the resulting communication challenges across heterogeneous cloud–edge network domains. USER enables cross-domain connectivity via tunneling-based cloud–edge networking for data exchange across network boundaries. To handle uneven bandwidth between intra-domain and cross-domain communi-

cation, USER employs a distributed data channel to localize traffic and reduce unnecessary cross-domain transfer. In addition, USER introduces streaming-multiprocessor-aware weight synchronization to prevent NCCL-based communication from monopolizing GPU resources and degrading throughput.

Tunneling-based Cloud-Edge Networking. USER operates over cloud–edge compute resources across distinct administrative network domains (e.g., NATs, campus networks, factory VLANs) that are inherently isolated and do not support direct communication. To bridge this gap, USER builds its communication plane on a flattened TCP/IP substrate based on the UDP tunneling technology, enabling all robot, training and rollout nodes to establish bidirectional connections through the tunnel. The control plane uses Ray [21] for cluster membership and worker placement, while the data plane relies on TCP rendezvous to bootstrap point-to-point communication groups; critically, USER binds all control/data traffic to the tunnel interface to make heterogeneous deployments robust to multihomed hosts and to avoid accidentally routing traffic over slow or firewalled links.

Distributed Data Channel. In USER, data exchange among nodes is unified through a channel abstraction. A channel represents a dataflow conduit connecting system components and carries observations, actions, states, and intermediate results. Conventional centralized communication, where data is first sent to a cloud node and then redistributed to edge nodes, is simple to implement but incurs substantial cross-domain traffic in cloud–edge deployments. Under multi-robot or highfrequency real-world interaction, such designs suffer from high latency and poor stability [3, 7]. To address this, USER provides a distributed data channel: a named, first-in-firstout(FIFO) producer–consumer queue hosted by lightweight channel services and accessed via asynchronous put/get APIs. Channels are internally sharded across service instances based on data keys (e.g., robot IDs) to localize traffic within edge or cloud regions and reduce cross-domain transfer. They support multiple producers and consumers, enabling robots and rollout nodes to stream data without direct, synchronous coupling. This design minimizes cross-domain communication and balances load across channel services.

SM-Aware Weight Synchronization. In USER, when weight synchronization is performed via the NVIDIA Collective Communications Library (NCCL) and transferred directly between GPUs, it occupies GPU execution resources, because NCCL’s collectives execute as CUDA kernels that consume streaming multiprocessors (SMs). USER makes this contention explicit and controllable through a tunable configuration that caps the maximum number of NCCL CTAs (cooperative thread arrays) used during weight transfer. By throttling NCCL’s SM footprint, USER prevents background weight synchronization from monopolizing GPU execution resources and degrading rollout latency and throughput. This allows USER to sustain stable, low-latency rollouts under asynchronous weight updates.

IV. LEARNING FRAMEWORK DESIGN

Building on the system architecture design that virtualizes and connects heterogeneous robots and compute resources, the learning framework design of USER focuses on how data and computation are organized at runtime. Specifically, it defines a unified framework for real-world learning, including a fully asynchronous pipeline, persistent-cache-aware buffer, and extensible abstractions for policies, algorithms, and rewards.

- A. Fully Asynchronous Pipeline

In real-world policy learning, the primary bottleneck lies in data collection rather than computation [17]. Physical interaction cannot be accelerated, which makes it essential to keep robots executing continuously. Synchronous pipelines that tightly couple data generation and training are prone to cascading stalls: delays in training propagate to execution, forcing robots to pause and significantly reducing data efficiency.

As illustrated in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4, USER organizes realworld policy learning as a fully asynchronous pipeline. On the data generation side, multiple environment workers execute policies on physical robots through rollout workers, continuously streaming observations and actions without being blocked by optimization. In parallel, human operators can intervene via teleoperation to provide corrections or demonstrations, while a reward worker assigns supervision signals. All interaction data are asynchronously ingested into a persistentcache-aware buffer (Sec. IV-B), which includes a trajectory replay buffer for autonomous rollouts and a demonstration buffer for pre-collected data and human interventions.

On the training side, learning workers asynchronously sample mini-batches from these buffers to update model parameters, supporting both reinforcement and imitation learning. The updated weights are periodically synchronized back to rollout workers, closing the loop while maintaining uninterrupted robot execution.

- B. Persistent-Cache-Aware Buffer

Real-world embodied learning involves long horizons, nonstationary policies, and asynchronous pipelines. Training spans multiple sessions and policy versions, where network failures, restarts, and human intervention are common. Data collected under different policies must often be reused for off-policy updates or recovery, making short-lived, in-memory buffers inadequate for real deployments.

USER adopts a persistent, index-based buffer (Fig. 5) that decouples storage from memory. Trajectories are asynchronously written to disk, while the buffer stores lightweight indices with metadata such as policy version, timestamps, and episode IDs, enabling temporal- and policy-aware sampling over long horizons. To balance efficiency and memory, USER adds a bounded in-memory cache with FIFO replacement. New samples enter the cache first; when full, old entries are evicted but remain indexed on disk. Evicted samples are transparently reloaded when requested, preserving highthroughput sampling with bounded memory.

Unlike in-memory buffers that keep only recent data [5, 26], USER’s persistent and cache-aware design supports arbitrarily large datasets and retains historical data across evolving policies. Persistence also improves robustness through crash recovery and pipeline decoupling, enabling reliable longhorizon real-world learning beyond volatile memory-centric designs.

C. Extensible Policies, Algorithms, and Rewards

USER is agnostic to model architectures and learning algorithms, exposing unified interfaces that enable heterogeneous policies, optimizers, and reward mechanisms to share a single execution and data pipeline.

At the policy level, USER supports both lightweight and large-scale models. Lightweight policies include CNN- and MLP-based controllers, such as ResNet-style visual policies [9], and expressive flow-matching policies [16] that represent actions via continuous probability flows. At larger scale, USER

[Figure 102]

- Fig. 5: Persistent-Cache-Aware Buffer. USER adopts a persistent, index-based buffer. Recent data is stored in memory while historical data is persisted to disk, effectively balancing access efficiency with storage capacity.

integrates VLA models (e.g., π0/π0.5 architectures [2, 12]) that reason over multimodal inputs and output continuous actions. Despite structural and computational differences, all policies are deployed through a unified rollout abstraction.

At the algorithm level, USER supports multiple learning paradigms for robotics. These include off-policy RL such as Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) [8], sample-efficient RL for flow policies (e.g., SAC-Flow [28]), human-in-the-loop methods like RL with pretrained data (RLPD) [1], and imitationstyle updates for large models such as HG-DAgger [14]. Training workers interact with policies through standardized sampling and update APIs, making the optimization layer interchangeable.

Reward specification is also modular. USER supports (i) rule-based task rewards, (ii) human-provided labels, and (iii) learned reward models. Rewards can be attached during rollout or computed offline in post-processing, enabling flexible supervision under real-world constraints.

By unifying policy representations, algorithms, and reward sources, USER enables diverse real-world learning setups—from RL to imitation and human-in-the-loop learning—without re-engineering deployment, data handling, or execution pipelines.

V. EXPERIMENT

We evaluate USER on a suite of simulated and real-world embodied tasks to validate both its system architecture and learning framework design. Through five groups of experiments, we demonstrate how USER’s core components support extensible and reliable real-world online learning:

- 1) (Sec. V-A) Extensibility of the learning framework: USER achieves high performance across multiple tasks while accommodating diverse policies, algorithms, and reward sources within a unified pipeline.
- 2) (Sec. V-B) Unified hardware abstraction: USER enables training over multi-robot and heterogeneous robot fleets through its hardware abstractio layer.
- 3) (Sec. V-C) Adaptive communication plane: USER supports cross-domain edge–cloud collaborative training via its adaptive communication design.
- 4) (Sec. V-D) Persistent-cache-aware buffer: USER provides high-capacity and high-throughput storage for long-horizon data ingestion and reuse.

A. Main Results Experiment Setup

We design a suite of five real-world manipulation tasks to evaluate the extensibility of USER’s learning framework, as shown in Fig. 6: Peg Insertion, Charger, Cap Tightening, Pickand-Place, and Table Clean-up. All tasks are conducted on a Franka robotic arm. Detailed task descriptions are provided in Appendix B.

All experimental settings are summarized in Tab. I. Experiments with small policies, including CNN and flow-based models, are executed on a local workstation equipped with an RTX 4090 (24GB) GPU, while large VLA policies such as the π0 model are trained and evaluated on a server with 4 NVIDIA A100 (80GB) GPUs. We select four representative algorithms spanning online reinforcement learning and imitation learning: SAC, RLPD, SAC-Flow and HG-DAgger. We select appropriate reward source for each task from rule-based rewards, human-provided rewards, and learned reward models. Rule-

based rewards are used for fixed-position manipulation tasks and computed from the end-effector pose. Human rewards are binary, with operators assigning 1 for success and 0 otherwise. The reward model classifies success (1) or failure (0) from observations. Implementation details are in Appendix A.

Task Performance Fig. 7 summarizes RL results on multiple manipulation tasks. Figs. 7a and 7b report RLPD, SAC, and SAC-Flow on Peg-Insertion and Charger. Both achieve nearperfect success within 2000s with similar overall performance.

SAC performs worse on Charger, likely because higher precision and dense rewards induce suboptimal behaviors. We further evaluate RLPD on Pick and Place and Cap Tightening (Fig. 7c). Cap Tightening converges quickly, while Pick and Place involves richer object dynamics and needs longer training. Still, RLPD reaches success rates approaching 1.0 on all tasks. Unlike RL, imitation learning depends on human demonstrations and intervention. During HG-DAgger training of π0, operators ensure success in each episode. As intervention steps approach zero, the policy becomes fully autonomous. π0 is initialized with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and then trained online. Tab. II compares success before and after training, and Fig. 8 shows intervention steps and buffer growth. For short-horizon Pick-and-Place, HG-Dagger reaches a 96% success rate in ∼30 minutes using only ∼200 online samples.

Reward Model To train a reliable reward model, we formulate the reward model as a binary classifier with a pre-trained ResNet18 [9] backbone. Human operators collect 20 successful trajectories, each remaining stationary for 20 timesteps after task completion to accumulate sufficient positive samples. The final dataset for the reward model comprises

approximately 1,600 frames, with a success-to-failure ratio of roughly 1:3. Fig. 9 shows the results of a CNN policy trained with our reward model. Notably, our reward model achieves performance comparable to human rewards on the peg insertion task.

B. Advantages of a Unified Hardware Layer

With a unified hardware abstraction, USER enables online policy learning on real robots without platform-specific modification. We demonstrate that this design supports efficient multi-robot training and robust learning across heterogeneous embodiments.

[Figure 136]

[Figure 137]

- Fig. 10: Parallel training on two Franka robot arms. The unified hardware layer enables distributed data collection and multi-task learning within a single system framework.

Training with Multiple Robots We first evaluate USER in a multi-robot setting. Using the unified hardware abstraction, we concurrently train policies on two Franka robot arms executing different manipulation tasks. As shown in Fig. 10, both tasks converge within approximately 2500 seconds, matching the convergence speed of single-robot baselines. These results indicate that USER can effectively scale real-world training through parallel data collection, improving sample efficiency without degrading learning stability.

achieves full convergence (Fig. 11b). Compared to singlerobot baselines, heterogeneous training presents significant challenges due to variations in arm DoF, end-effector morphology, camera parameters, and target colors. Consequently, the training process requires approximately two hours to reach convergence.

C. Capability of the Communication Plane

In this section, we demonstrate the design of USER’s adaptive communication plane through both cross-domain and same-domain experiments.

Cross-Domain Communication We evaluate the effectiveness of the distributed data channel under a cross-domain deployment setting. The master node is located in City A and performs policy training, while two nodes in City B handle rollout and robot control, respectively. The two nodes in City B are connected via a high-bandwidth local network, whereas the connection between City A and City B spans thousands of kilometers and incurs high latency and limited bandwidth. This cross-domain deployment reflects a realistic cloud-edge setup, where communication between geographically distributed nodes is enabled via tunneled-based connections.

The first two rows of Tab. III report the cross-domain results. Across both configurations, the rollout and environment interaction times remain similar, as these operations are executed locally without cross-domain communication. In contrast, enabling distributed channels substantially reduces the communication overhead for transmitting observations and actions between the two nodes in City B. As a result, the total time required to generate a single episode is reduced by approximately 3× compared to the centralized baseline.

Same-Domain Communication We further evaluate USER in a same-domain setting, where all three nodes are connected via high-speed local networks. The third and fourth rows of Tab. III show the corresponding results. Even under this favorable condition, distributed channels consistently reduce communication overhead.

Notably, comparing the first and third rows of Tab. III shows that the two nodes in City B under cross-domain deployment achieve communication efficiency comparable to the all-samedomain setup, indicating that USER effectively exploits local high-bandwidth links while avoiding unnecessary crossdomain data transfers.

(b) Weight synchronization intervals do affect convergence behavior, where interval = 1 is the most unstable setting.

- D. Validation for Persistent and Cache-aware Buffer

USER’s buffer combines persistent storage with an inmemory cache to balance efficiency and capacity. Let s be the buffer size and c the cache size, with ratio r = c/s. We profile throughput under different cache ratios in Fig. 12a, showing that larger r improves throughput. We further evaluate throughput under varying buffer sizes (Fig. 12b). A pure inmemory buffer achieves the highest throughput but is memorylimited, while an in-disk buffer provides large capacity at less than half the throughput. Our design strikes a balance, achieving higher throughput than standard disk buffers while retaining large capacity.

- E. Asynchronous Design

To demonstrate the advantages of our synchronous framework over traditional synchronous systems, we first profiled the latency of individual stages in both configurations. As shown in Tab. IV, although per-stage latencies remain similar, the asynchronous system achieves significantly higher throughput via pipeline overlapping (Fig. 4). Specifically, for π0 and CNN models, USER’s asynchronous pipeline improves

Fig. 13a further illustrates the disparity in convergence speeds on the peg insertion task, CNN policy, with RLPD. The asynchronous pipeline significantly accelerates training, reducing the convergence time from 8000+ seconds to ∼ 1500 seconds.

Ablation for Policy Weights Synchronization Interval The weight synchronization interval is a critical design parameter in asynchronous systems. We conducted an ablation study on the peg insertion task using the RLPD algorithm with a CNN policy. As shown in Fig. 13b, small synchronization intervals (like 1 and 8) cause frequent in-episode weight updates. This induces policy non-stationarity, resulting in slower convergence or complete divergence. Conversely, larger synchronization intervals ensure a stable update.

VI. CONCLUSION

This paper presents USER, a unified and extensible system for real-world online policy learning. USER treats robots as first-class hardware resources alongside GPUs and integrates adaptive communication, persistent cache-aware buffering, and a fully asynchronous training pipeline into a single learning infrastructure. By remaining agnostic to policy architectures and optimization methods, USER supports diverse paradigms—from imitation learning and reinforcement learning to human-in-the-loop learning—deployed on heterogeneous robots within a unified pipeline. Experiments on both simulated and real-world benchmarks show that USER enables efficient policy learning over heterogeneous multi-robot fleets, provides robust edge–cloud cross-domain communication, and maintains high-capacity, high-throughput buffering for longhorizon training.

APPENDIX

- A. Algorithm Implementation Details

In this section, we first clarify the notation in reinforcement learning, and then provide the implementation details and hyperparameters for the four primary algorithms integrated into USER.

1) Problem Setting and Notation.: We consider a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) defined by (S,O,A,P,r,γ), where st ∈ S denotes the latent environment state, ot ∈ O the observation, at ∈ A the action, P(st+1 | st,at) the transition dynamics, r(st,at) the reward function, and γ ∈ (0,1) the discount factor. The policy πθ(at | ot) conditions only on observations.

All off-policy algorithms are trained using a replay buffer

- B that stores transitions of the form (ot,at,rt,ot+1). For notational simplicity, we omit the time index when it is clear from context and use (o,a,r,o′) to denote a generic transition sampled from B.

We denote the critic network by Qψ(o,a), the policy by πθ(a | o), and the corresponding target networks by Qψ¯.

2) SAC: Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) is an off-policy actorcritic algorithm based on the maximum entropy reinforcement learning framework. It optimizes a stochastic policy by maximizing both the expected return and the policy entropy:

T

t,at)∼ρπ r(ot,at) + αH(π(· | ot)) , (1)

E(o

J(π) =

t=0

where α is the temperature parameter controlling the strength of entropy H regularization.

Critic Update. The soft Q-function is trained by minimizing the Bellman residual:

LQ(ψ) = E(o,a,r,o′)∼B Qψ(o,a) −(r + γEa′∼πθ(·|o′)[Qψ¯(o′,a′) − α log πθ(a′ | o′)]) 2 ,

(2)

where a′ denotes an action sampled from the current policy at the next observation o′, and Qψ¯ is the target critic updated via exponential moving average(EMA).

Actor Update. The policy is updated by minimizing

θ(·|o) α log πθ(a | o) − Qψ(o,a) . (3)

Lπ(θ) = Eo∼B, a∼π

Due to the sample efficiency of off-policy learning, SAC has been widely adopted for RL in real-world. The specific hyperparameters used for our implementation, including the network architecture and entropy regularization settings, are summarized in Tab. V.

3) SAC-Flow: SAC-Flow extends SAC by parameterizing the policy using a continuous-time flow-based model. The policy is defined through a velocity network vθ that evolves a latent action variable. SAC-Flow reparameterized vθ as a gated (Flow-G) or transformer-decoded (Flow-T) architecture to stabilize gradients.

4) RLPD: RLPD combines offline demonstration data with online exploration to significantly improve sample efficiency. Balanced Sampling. At each update step, mini-batches are constructed by sampling transitions from both the online replay buffer Bonline and the demonstration buffer Bdemo at a fixed ratio:

## batch = {(s,a,r,s′)i ∼ Bonline ∪ (s,a,r,s′)j ∼ Bdemo}

Ensemble Critics with Layer Norm: To handle high UTD ratios, RLPD utilizes an ensemble of M Q-functions with Layer Normalization to stabilize the values:

Qψ¯j(s′,a′) − α log πθ(a′|s′))

Qtarget = r + γ( min

j=1,...,M

RLPD leverages offline demonstration data to guide policy learning and accelerate convergence, significantly improving sample efficiency. The hyperparameters of RLPD are provided in Tab. VII.

Gating Mechanism. At each timestep, the executed action is selected as

Behavior Cloning Objective. State-action pairs collected during intervention are stored in Dintervene, and the policy is updated via a behavior cloning (BC) loss:

## LBC(θ) = E(o,ah)∼Dintervene∪Ddemo ∥πθ(o) − ah∥2 . (8)

We utilize HG-DAgger to fine-tune π0 via human interventions. We first perform Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on a pre-collected dataset to initialize the π0 model, providing the policy with a non-zero initial success rate. The parameters of SFT and HG-DAgger are listed in Table VIII.

B. Task Implementation Details

In this section, we detail task settings and task-specific training configurations. Fig. 14 shows all five tasks used for evaluation.

1) Peg Insertion: The task requires the robot to perform high-precision insertion of a peg into its corresponding slot. The static pose of the slot enables straightforward success verification and automated resetting, making this task ideal for real-world RL.

Table IX reports the task-specific training settings for the Peg Insertion task. In this task, we use a single wrist camera as visual observation. The state observation includes the pose, velocity, force, torque of the end-effector (EE), and the gripper pose. The reward signal is derived directly from the distance between the end-effector and the target pose.

5) HG-DAgger: HG-DAgger is an interactive imitation learning algorithm designed for safe and efficient online finetuning. It relies on a human expert to monitor the policy and intervene when necessary.

2) Charger Plugging: The charger plugging task involves inserting a charger into a socket. This task presents a significant challenge in high-precision manipulation, defined by the narrow tolerance of the socket geometry, the sparsity of visual

features, and the visual occlusion during the approach phase. To address these challenges, we employ a desktop third-view camera for visual feedback.

Tab. X details task configurations and task-specific training settings. Given that the task necessitates sub-millimeter precision, we utilized a more constrained bounding box to focus the operational workspace.

3) Cap Tightening: The cap tightening task requires the policy to drive a pre-positioned cap toward a target configuration. For the required angular displacement spans multiple full rotations, the policy must learn a cyclic regrasping strategy to

facilitate continuous, multi-turn manipulation.

We equip a wrist camera and a stationary third-view camera to provide both egocentric and allocentric perspectives. This task requires higher rotation relative to translational displacement, so we employ an specific bounding box. Reward signals are sparsely provided by a human operator, who utilizes a foot-pedal interface to assign a binary success signal upon completion. Environment resets are managed manually as well. The detailed task settings are available in Tab. XI.

4) Pick-and-Place: The pick-and-place task requires the policy to successfully transfer objects between two trays. This task is characterized by a vast exploration space, posing significant challenges for sample efficiency. We employ a wrist cemera and a third-view camera at a 45-degree downward view. This combination ensures the policy to access to both fine-grained contact information and broad spatial context.

Following our human-in-the-loop framework, both reward signals and environment resets are mediated by a human operator, as detailed in Tab. XII.

5) Table Clean-up: The table clean-up task is a longhorizon, multi-stage manipulation task that requires a high degree of precision. The policy must execute a specific sequence: first, placing a marker into a container (orange box); second, nesting that container within a larger receptacle (white box); and finally, close a semi-transparent lid. Both the grasping of the orange container and the final lid-closure demand fluid, high-precision control and contact-rich interactions.

- C. Hardware Details

We conduct all experiments across two distinct robotic platforms: a 7-DoF Franka robot arm and a 6-DoF low-cost ARX robot arm (Fig. 15). This section provides a detailed description of the robotic hardware configurations.

- 1) Franka Robot Arm: Most of our experiments were con-

ducted using a Franka Emika Panda research arm. The Franka Emika Panda is a 7-DOF collaborative robot arm, widely utilized in robotics research for its high executing precision and integrated sensing capabilities. The robot arm features

highly sensitive torque sensors in all seven joints, providing force and torque inputs for the policy. We use Franka Control Interface (FCI) to control the robot via libfranka. We utilize external RealSense D435i cameras to provide perception.

RL involves interacting with the environment through trial and error. Consequently, we employ an impedance controller following SERL [17]. Compared to standard position controllers, impedance control offers significant advantages in contact-rich tasks. By regulating the dynamic relationship between interaction forces and motion, impedance controller effectively modeling the robot as a tunable mass-springdamper system. It allows the policy to exhibit inherent compliance during collisions rather than rigidly tracking trajectories, ensuring hardware safety during exploration.

Our RL policy sends control targets at 10 Hz for the low-level impedance controller to track at 1k Hz. A typical impedance control objective is

F = kp · e + kd · e˙ + Fff + Fcor,

where e = p − pref, p is the measured pose, and pref is the target pose. Fff is the feed-forward force, Fcor is the Coriolis force. To map this objective into the joint space, we compute the required torques using the Jacobian transpose. The resulting control law emulates a PD-controlled springdamper system, where the system tracks the equilibrium pref with stiffness and damping gains defined by kp and kd, respectively. The parameters of this impedance controller is detailed in Tab. XIV.

- 2) ARX arm: The ARX-R5 is a cost-effective, 6-DOF robot

arm. Due to the absence of force/torque sensors, we employ a simple PD position controller for operation. The RL policy sends position target at 10 Hz, and the position controller tracks in 200 Hz. The manipulator is equipped with a wrist fisheye camera, as illustrated in Fig. 15b.
