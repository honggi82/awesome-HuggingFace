### Abstract:

Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive results in developing generalist planning agents for diverse tasks. However, grounding these plans in expansive, multi-ﬂoor, and multi-room environments presents a signiﬁcant challenge for robotics. We introduce SayPlan, a scalable approach to LLM-based, large-scale task planning for robotics using 3D scene graph (3DSG) representations. To ensure the scalability of our approach, we: (1) exploit the hierarchical nature of 3DSGs to allow LLMs to conduct a semantic search for task-relevant subgraphs from a smaller, collapsed representation of the full graph; (2) reduce the planning horizon for the LLM by integrating a classical path planner and (3) introduce an iterative replanning pipeline that reﬁnes the initial plan using feedback from a scene graph simulator, correcting infeasible actions and avoiding planning failures. We evaluate our approach on two large-scale environments spanning up to 3 ﬂoors and 36 rooms with 140 assets and objects and show that our approach is capable of grounding large-scale, long-horizon task plans from abstract, and natural language instruction for a mobile manipulator robot to execute. We provide real robot video demonstrations on our project page sayplan.github.io.

## 1 Introduction

“Make me a coffee and place it on my desk” – The successful execution of such a seemingly straightforward command remains a daunting task for today’s robots. The associated challenges permeate every aspect of robotics, encompassing navigation, perception, manipulation as well as high-level task planning. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) [1, 2, 3] have led to signiﬁcant progress in incorporating common sense knowledge for robotics [4, 5, 6]. This enables robots to plan complex strategies for a diverse range of tasks that require a substantial amount of background knowledge and semantic comprehension.

For LLMs to be effective planners in robotics, they must be grounded in reality, that is, they must adhere to the constraints presented by the physical environment in which the robot operates, including the available affordances, relevant predicates, and the impact of actions on the current state. Furthermore, in expansive environments, the robot must additionally understand where it is, locate items of interest, as well comprehend the topological arrangement of the environment in order to plan across the necessary regions. To address this, recent works have explored the utilization of vision-based value functions [4], object detectors [7, 8], or Planning Domain Deﬁnition Language (PDDL) descriptions of a scene [9, 10] to ground the output of the LLM-based planner. However, these efforts are primarily conﬁned to small-scale environments, typically single rooms with pre-encoded information on all the existing assets and objects present. The challenge lies in scaling these models. As the environment’s complexity and dimensions expand, and as more rooms and entities enter the

Figure 1: SayPlan Overview (top). SayPlan operates across two stages to ensure scalability: (left) Given a collapsed 3D scene graph and a task instruction, semantic search is conducted by the LLM to identify a suitable subgraph that contains the required items to solve the task; (right) The explored subgraph is then used by the LLM to generate a high-level task plan, where a classical path planner completes the navigational component of the plan; ﬁnally, the plan goes through an iterative replanning process with feedback from a scene graph simulator until an executable plan is identiﬁed. Numbers on the top-left corners represent the ﬂow of operations.

scene, pre-encoding all the necessary information within the LLM’s context becomes increasingly infeasible.

To this end, we present a scalable approach to ground LLM-based task planners across environments spanning multiple rooms and ﬂoors. We achieve this by exploiting the growing body of 3D scene graph (3DSG) research [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]. 3DSGs capture a rich topological and hierarchicallyorganised semantic graph representation of an environment with the versatility to encode the necessary information required for task planning including object state, predicates, affordances and attributes using natural language – suitable for parsing by an LLM. We can leverage a JSON representation of this graph as input to a pre-trained LLM, however, to ensure the scalability of the plans to expansive scenes, we present three key innovations.

Firstly, we present a mechanism that enables the LLM to conduct a semantic search for a taskrelevant subgraph G by manipulating the nodes of a ‘collapsed’ 3DSG, which exposes only the top level of the full graph G, via expand and contract API function calls – thus making it feasible to plan over increasingly large-scale environments. In doing so, the LLM maintains focus on a relatively small, informative subgraph, G during planning, without exceeding its token limit. Secondly, as the horizon of the task plans across such environments tends to grow with the complexity and range of the given task instructions, there is an increasing tendency for the LLM to hallucinate or produce infeasible action sequences [17, 18, 7]. We counter this by ﬁrstly relaxing the need for the LLM to generate the navigational component of the plan, and instead leverage an existing optimal path planner such as Dijkstra [19] to connect high-level nodes generated by the LLM. Finally, to ensure the feasibility of the proposed plan, we introduce an iterative replanning pipeline that veriﬁes and reﬁnes the initial plan using feedback from a scene graph simulator in order to correct for any unexecutable actions, e.g., missing to open the fridge before putting something into it – thus avoiding planning failures due to inconsistencies, hallucinations, or violations of the physical constraints and predicates imposed by the environment.

Our approach SayPlan ensures feasible and grounded plan generation for a mobile manipulator robot operating in large-scale environments spanning multiple ﬂoors and rooms. We evaluate our framework across a range of 90 tasks organised into four levels of difﬁculty. These include semantic search tasks such as (“Find me something non-vegetarian.”) to interactive, long-horizon tasks with ambiguous multi-room objectives that require a signiﬁcant level of common-sense reasoning (“Let’s play a prank on Niko”). These tasks are assessed in two expansive environments, including a large ofﬁce ﬂoor spanning 37 rooms and 150 interactable assets and objects, and a three-storey house with 28 rooms and 112 objects. Our experiments validate SayPlan’s ability to scale task planning to large-scale environments while conserving a low token footprint. By introducing a semantic search pipeline, we can reduce full large-scale scene representations by up to 82.1% for LLM parsing and our iterative replanning pipeline allows for near-perfect executability rates, suitable for execution on a real mobile manipulator robot.1

## 2 Related Work

Task planning in robotics aims to generate a sequence of high-level actions to achieve a goal within an environment. Conventional methods employ domain-speciﬁc languages such as PDDL [20, 21, 22] and ASP [23] together with semantic parsing [24, 25], search techniques [26, 27] and complex heuristics [28] to arrive at a solution. These methods, however, lack both the scalability to large environments as well as the task generality required when operating in the real world. Hierarchical and reinforcement learning-based alternatives [29, 30], [31] face challenges with data demands and scalability. Our work leverages the in-context learning capabilities of LLMs to generate task plans across 3D scene graphs. Tasks, in this case, can be naturally expressed using language, with the internet scale training of LLMs providing the desired knowledge for task generality, while 3D scene graphs provide the grounding necessary for large-scale environment operation. This allows for a general and scalable framework when compared to traditional non-LLM-based alternatives.

Task planning with LLMs, that is, translating natural language prompts into task plans for robotics, is an emergent trend in the ﬁeld. Earlier studies have effectively leveraged pre-trained LLMs’ incontext learning abilities to generate actionable plans for embodied agents [4, 10, 9, 8, 32, 7, 33]. A key challenge for robotics is grounding these plans within the operational environment of the robot. Prior works have explored the use of object detectors [8, 7], PDDL environment representations [10, 9, 34] or value functions [4] to achieve this grounding, however, they are predominantly constrained to single-room environments, and scale poorly with the number of objects in a scene which limits their ability to plan over multi-room or multi-ﬂoor environments. In this work, we explore the use of 3D scene graphs and the ability of LLMs to generate plans over large-scale scenes by exploiting the inherent hierarchical and semantic nature of these representations.

Integrating external knowledge in LLMs has been a growing line of research combining language models with external tools to improve the reliability of their outputs. In such cases, external modules are used to provide feedback or extra information to the LLM to guide its output generation. This is achieved either through API calls to external tools [35, 36] or as textual feedback from the operating environment [37, 8]. More closely related to our work, CLAIRIFY [38] iteratively leverage compiler error feedback to re-prompt an LLM to generate syntactically valid code. Building on these ideas, we propose an iterative plan veriﬁcation process with feedback from a scene graph-based simulator to ensure all generated plans adhere to the constraints and predicates captured by the preconstructed scene graph. This ensures the direct executability of the plan on a mobile manipulator robot, operating in the corresponding real-world environment.

### 3.1 Problem Formulation

We aim to address the challenge of long-range task planning for an autonomous agent, such as a mobile manipulator robot, in a large-scale environment based on natural language instructions. This requires the robot to comprehend abstract and ambiguous instructions, understand the scene and generate task plans involving both navigation and manipulation of a mobile robot within an

Our focus is on integrating large-scale scenes into planning agents based on Language Models (LLMs) and solving the scalability challenge. We aim to tackle two key problems: 1) representing large-scale scenes within LLM token limitations, and 2) mitigating LLM hallucinations and erroneous outputs when generating long-horizon plans in large-scale environments.

Scene Representation: 3D Scene Graphs (3DSG) [11, 12, 14] have recently emerged as an actionable world representation for robots [13, 15, 16, 39, 40, 41], which hierarchically abstract the environment at multiple levels through spatial semantics and object relationships while capturing relevant states, affordances and predicates of the entities present in the environment. Formally, a 3DSG is a hierarchical multigraph G = (V,E) in which the set of vertices V comprises V1∪V2∪...∪VK, with each Vk signifying the set of vertices at a particular level of the hierarchy k. Edges stemming from a vertex v ∈ Vk may only terminate in Vk−1 ∪ Vk ∪ Vk+1, i.e. edges connect nodes within the same level, or one level higher or lower.

Figure 2: Hierarchical Structure of a 3D Scene Graph. This graph consists of 4 levels. Notes that the room nodes are connected to one another via sequences of pose nodes which capture the topological arrangement of a scene.

We assume a pre-constructed 3DSG representation of a large-scale environment generated using existing techniques [15, 13, 11]. The entire 3DSG can be represented as a NetworkX Graph object [42] and text-serialised into a JSON data format that can be parsed directly by a pretrained LLM. An example of a single asset node from the 3DSG is represented as: {name:

coffee_machine, type: asset, location: kitchen, affordances: [turn_on, turn_off, release], state: off, attributes: [red, automatic], position: [2.34, 0.45, 2.23]} with edges between nodes captured as {kitchen↔coffee machine}. The 3DSG is organized in a hierarchical manner with four primary levels: ﬂoors, rooms, assets, and objects as shown in Figure 2. The top level contains ﬂoors, each of which branches out to several rooms. These rooms are interconnected through pose nodes to represent the environment’s topological structure. Within each room, we ﬁnd assets (immovable entities) and objects (movable entities). Both asset and object nodes encode particulars including state, affordances, additional attributes such as colour or weight, and 3D pose. The graph also incorporates a dynamic agent

node, denoting a robot’s location within the scene. Note that this hierarchy is scalable and node levels can be adapted to capture even larger environments e.g. campuses and buildings

Scene Graph Simulator ψ refers to a set of API calls for manipulating and operating over JSON formatted 3DSGs, using the following functions: 1) collapse(G): Given a full 3DSG, this function returns an updated scene graph that exposes only the highest level within the 3DSG hierarchy e.g. ﬂoor nodes. 2) expand(node name): Returns an updated 3DSG that reveals all the nodes connected to node name in the level below. 3) contract(node name): Returns an updated 3DSG that hides all the nodes connected to node name in the level below. 4) verify_plan(plan): Forward simulates the generated plan at the abstract graph level captured by the 3DSG to check if each action adheres to the environment’s predicates, states and affordances. Returns textual feedback e.g. “cannot pick up banana” if the fridge containing the banana is closed.

### 3.3 Approach

We present a scalable framework for grounding the generalist task planning capabilities of pretrained LLMs in large-scale environments spanning multiple ﬂoors and rooms using 3DSG representations. Given a 3DSG G and a task instruction I deﬁned in natural language, we can view our framework SayPlan as a high-level task planner π(a|I,G), capable of generating long-horizon plans a grounded in the environment within which a mobile manipulator robot operates. This plan is then fed to a low-level visually grounded motion planner for real-world execution. To ensure the scalability of SayPlan, two stages are introduced: Semantic Search and Iterative Replanning which we detail below. An overview of the SayPlan pipeline is illustrated in Figure 1 with the corresponding pseudo-code given in Algorithm 1.

Semantic Search: When planning over 3DSGs using LLMs we take note of two key observations: 1) A 3DSG of a large-scale environment can grow inﬁnitely with the number of rooms, assets and objects it contains, making it impractical to pass as input to an LLM due to token limits and 2) only a subset of the full 3DSG G is required to solve any given task e.g. we don’t need to know about the toothpaste in the bathroom when making a cup of coffee. To this end, the Semantic Search stage seeks to identify this smaller, task-speciﬁc subgraph G from the full 3DSG which only contains the entities in the environment required to solve the given task instruction. To identify G from a full 3DSG, we exploit the semantic hierarchy of these representations and the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. We ﬁrstly collapse G to expose only its top level e.g. the ﬂoor nodes, reducing the 3DSG initial token representation by ≈ 80%. The LLM manipulates this collapsed graph via expand and contract API calls in order to identify the desired subgraph for the task based on the given instruction I. This is achieved using in-context learning over a set of input-out examples (see Appendix J), and utilising chain-of-thought prompting to guide the LLM in identifying which nodes to manipulate. The chosen API call and node are executed within the scene graph simulator, and the updated 3DSG is passed back to the LLM for further exploration. If an expanded node is found to contain irrelevant entities for the task, the LLM contracts it to manage token limitations and maintain a task-speciﬁc subgraph (see Figure 3). To avoid expanding already-contracted nodes, we maintain a list of previously expanded nodes, passed as an additional Memory input to the LLM, facilitating a Markovian decision-making process and allowing SayPlan to scale to extensive search sequences without the overhead of maintaining the full interaction history [5]. The LLM autonomously proceeds to the planning phase once all necessary assets and objects are identiﬁed in the current subgraph G . An example of the LLM-scene graph interaction during Semantic Search is provided in Appendix K.

Iterative Replanning: Given the identiﬁed subgraph G and the same task instruction I from above, the LLM enters the planning stage of the pipeline. Here the LLM is tasked with generating a sequence of node-level navigational (goto(pose2)) and manipulation (pickup(coffee_mug)) actions that satisfy the given task instruction. LLMs, however, are not perfect planning agents and tend to hallucinate or produce erroneous outputs [43, 9]. This is further exacerbated when planning over large-scale environments or long-horizon tasks. We facilitate the generation of task plans by the LLM via two mechanisms. First, we shorten the LLM’s planning horizon by delegating pose-level path planning to an optimal path planner, such as Dijkstra. For example, a typical plan output such as [goto(meeting_room), goto(pose13), goto(pose14), goto(pose8), ..., goto(kitchen), access(fridge), open(fridge)] is simpliﬁed to [goto(meeting_room), goto(kitchen), access(fridge), open(fridge)]. The path

planner handles ﬁnding the optimal route between high-level locations, allowing the LLM to focus on essential manipulation components of the task. Secondly, we build on the self-reﬂection capabilities of LLMs [17] to iteratively correct their generated plans using textual, task-agnostic feedback from a scene graph simulator which evaluates if the generated plan complies with the scene graph’s predicates, state, and affordances. For instance, a pick(banana) action might fail if the robot is already holding something, if it is not in the correct location or if the fridge was not opened beforehand. Such failures are transformed into textual feedback (e.g., ”cannot pick banana”), appended to the LLM’s input, and used to generate an updated, executable plan. This iterative process, involving planning, validation, and feedback integration, continues until a feasible plan is obtained. The validated plan is then passed to a low-level motion planner for robotic execution. An example of the LLM-scene graph interaction during iterative replanning is provided in Appendix L. Speciﬁc implementation details are provided in Appendix A.

## 4 Experimental Setup

We design our experiments to evaluate the 3D scene graph reasoning capabilities of LLMs with a particular focus on high-level task planning pertaining to a mobile manipulator robot. The plans adhere to a particular embodiment consisting of a 7-degree-of-freedom robot arm with a two-ﬁngered gripper attached to a mobile base. We use two large-scale environments, shown in Figure 4, which exhibit multiple rooms and multiple ﬂoors which the LLM agent has to plan across. To better ablate and showcase the capabilities of SayPlan, we decouple its semantic search ability from the overall causal planning capabilities using the following two evaluation settings as shown in Appendix C:

Semantic Search: Here, we focus on queries which test the semantic search capabilities of an LLM provided with a collapsed 3D scene graph. This requires the LLM to reason over the room and ﬂoor node names and their corresponding attributes in order to aid its search for the relevant assets and objects required to solve the given task instruction. We evaluate against a human baseline to understand how the semantic search capabilities of an LLM compare to a human’s thought process. Furthermore, to gain a better understanding of the impact different LLM models have on this graphbased reasoning, we additionally compare against a variant of SayPlan using GPT-3.5.

Causal Planning: In this experiment, we evaluate the ability of SayPlan to generate feasible plans to solve a given natural language instruction. The evaluation metrics are divided into two components: 1) Correctness, which primarily validates the overall goal of the plan and its alignment to what a human would do to solve the task and 2) Executability, which evaluates the alignment of the plan to the constraints of the scene graph environment and its ability to be executed by a mobile manipulator robot. We note here that for a plan to be executable, it does not necessarily have to be correct and vice versa. We evaluate SayPlan against two baseline methods that integrate an LLM for task planning:

LLM-As-Planner, which generates a full plan sequence in an open-loop manner; the plan includes the full sequence of both navigation and manipulation actions that the robot must execute to complete a task, and LLM+P, an ablated variant of SayPlan, which only incorporates the path planner to allow for shorter horizon plan sequences, without any iterative replanning.

We summarise the results for the semantic search evaluation in Table 1. SayPlan (GPT-3.5) consistently failed to reason over the input graph representation, hallucinating nodes to explore or stagnating at exploring the same node multiple times. SayPlan (GPT-4) in contrast achieved 86.7% and 73.3% success in identifying the desired subgraph across both the simple and complex search tasks respectively, demonstrating signiﬁcantly better graph-based reasoning than GPT-3.5.

While as expected the human baseline achieved 100% on all sets of instructions, we are more interested in the qualitative assessment of the common-sense reasoning used during semantic search. More speciﬁcally we would like to identify the similarity in the semantic search heuristics utilised by humans and that used by the underlying LLM based on the given task instruction.

We present the full sequence of explored nodes for both SayPlan (GPT-4) and the human baseline in Appendix F. As shown in the tables, SayPlan (GPT-4) demonstrates remarkably similar performance to a human’s semantic and common sense reasoning for most tasks, exploring a similar sequence of nodes given a particular instruction. For example, when asked to “ﬁnd a ripe banana”, the LLM ﬁrst explores the kitchen followed by the next most likely location, the cafeteria. In the case where no semantics are present in the instruction such

- as “ﬁnd me object K31X”, we note that the LLM agent is capable of conducting a breadthﬁrst-like search across all the unexplored nodes. This highlights the importance of meaningful node names and attributes that capture the relevant environment semantics that the LLM can leverage to relate the query instruction for efﬁcient search.

An odd failure case in the simple search instructions involved negation, where the agent consistently failed when presented with questions such as “Find me an ofﬁce that does not have a cabinet” or “Find me a bathroom with no toilet”. Other failure cases noted across the complex search instructions included the LLM’s failure to conduct simple distance-based and count-based reasoning over graph nodes. While trivial to a human, this does require the LLM agent to reason over multiple nodes simultaneously, where it tends to hallucinate or miscount connected nodes.

Scalability Analysis: We additionally analyse the scalability of SayPlan during semantic search. Table 2 illustrates the impact of exploiting the hierarchical nature of 3D scene graphs and allowing the LLM to explore the graph from a collapsed initial state. This allows for a reduction of 82.1% in the initial input tokens required to represent the Ofﬁce environment and a 60.4% reduction for the Home environment. In Figure 3, we illustrate how endowing the LLM with the ability to contract explored nodes which it deems unsuitable for solving the task allows it to maintain near-constant input memory from a token perspective across the entire semantic search process. Note that the initial number of tokens already present represents the input prompt tokens as given in Appendix J. Further ablation studies on the scalability of SayPlan to even larger 3DSGs are provided in Appendix H.

### 5.2 Causal Planning

The results for causal planning across simple and long-horizon instructions are summarised in Table 3 (left). We compared SayPlan’s performance against two baselines: LLM-As-Planner and LLM+P. All three methods displayed consistent correctness in simple planning tasks at 93%, given that this metric is more a function of the underlying LLMs reasoning capabilities. However, it is interesting to note that in the long-horizon tasks, both the path planner and iterative replanning play an important role in improving this correctness metric by reducing the planning horizon and allowing the LLM to reﬂect on its previous output.

The results illustrate that the key to ensuring the task plan’s executability was iterative replanning. Both LLM-As-Planner and LLM+P exhibited poor executability, whereas SayPlan achieved nearperfect executability as a result of iterative replanning, which ensured that the generated plans were grounded to adhere to the constraints and predicated imposed by the environment. Detailed task plans and errors encountered are provided in Appendix G. We summarise these errors in Table 3 (right) which shows that plans generated with LLM+P and LLM-As-Planner entailed various types of errors limiting their executability. LLM+P mitigated navigational path planning errors as a result of the classical path planner however still suffered from errors pertaining to the manipulation of the environment - missing actions or incorrect actions which violate environment predicates. SayPlan mitigated these errors via iterative replanning, however in 6.67% of tasks, it failed to correct for some hallucinated nodes. While we believe these errors could be eventually corrected via iterative replanning, we limited the number of replanning steps to 5 throughout all experiments. We provide an illustration of the real-world execution of a generated plan using SayPlan on a mobile manipulator robot coupled with a vision-guided motion controller [44, 45] in Appendix I.

## 6 Limitations

SayPlan is notably constrained by the limitations inherent in current large language models (LLMs), including biases and inaccuracies, affecting the validity of its generated plans. More speciﬁcally, SayPlan is limited by the graph-based reasoning capabilities of the underlying LLM which fails

- at simple distance-based reasoning, node count-based reasoning and node negation. Future work could explore ﬁne-tuning these models for these speciﬁc tasks or alternatively incorporate existing and more complex graph reasoning tools [46] to facilitate decision-making. Secondly, SayPlan’s current framework is constrained by the need for a pre-built 3D scene graph and assumes that objects remain static post-map generation, signiﬁcantly restricting its adaptability to dynamic realworld environments. Future work could explore how online scene graph SLAM systems [15] could be integrated within the SayPlan framework to account for this. Additionally, the incorporation of open-vocabulary representations within the scene graph could yield a general scene representation

- as opposed to solely textual node descriptions. Lastly, a potential limitation of the current system lies in the scene graph simulator and its ability to capture the various planning failures within the environment. While this works well in the cases presented in this paper, for more complex tasks involving a diverse set of predicates and affordances, the incorporation of relevant feedback messages for each instance may become infeasible and forms an important avenue for future work in this area.

## 7 Conclusion

SayPlan is a natural language-driven planning framework for robotics that integrates hierarchical 3D scene graphs and LLMs to plan across large-scale environments spanning multiple ﬂoors and rooms. We ensure the scalability of our approach by exploiting the hierarchical nature of 3D scene graphs and the semantic reasoning capabilities of LLMs to enable the agent to explore the scene graph from the highest level within the hierarchy, resulting in a signiﬁcant reduction in the initial tokens required to capture larger environments. Once explored, the LLM generates task plans for a mobile manipulator robot, and a scene graph simulator ensures that the plan is feasible and grounded to the environment via iterative replanning. The framework surpasses existing techniques in producing correct, executable plans, which a robot can then follow. Finally, we successfully translate validated plans to a real-world mobile manipulator agent which operates across multiple rooms, assets and objects in a large ofﬁce environment. SayPlan represents a step forward for general-purpose service robotics that can operate in our homes, hospitals and workplaces, laying the groundwork for future research in this ﬁeld.

## A Implementation Details

We utilise GPT-4 [3] as the underlying LLM agent unless otherwise stated. We follow a similar prompting structure to Wake et al. [5] as shown in Appendix J. We deﬁne the agent’s role, details pertaining to the scene graph environment, the desired output structure and a set of input-output examples which together form the static prompt used for in-context learning. This static prompt is both task- and environment-agnostic and takes up ≈3900 tokens of the LLM’s input. During semantic search, both the 3D Scene Graph and Memory components of the input prompt get updated at each step, while during iterative replanning only the Feedback component gets updated with information from the scene graph simulator. In all cases, the LLM is prompted to output a JSON object containing arguments to call the provided API functions.

We evaluate SayPlan across a set of two large-scale environments spanning multiple rooms and ﬂoors as shown in Figure 4. We provide details of each of these environments below, including a breakdown of the number of entities and tokens required to represent them in the 3DSG:

Ofﬁce: A large-scale ofﬁce ﬂoor, spanning 37 rooms and 151 assets and objects which the agent can interact with. A full and collapsed 3D scene graph representation of this environment are provided in Appendix D and E respectively. This scene graph represents a real-world ofﬁce ﬂoor within which a mobile manipulator robot is present. This allows us to embody the plans generated using SayPlan and evaluate their feasibility in the corresponding environment. Real-world video demonstrations of a mobile manipulator robot executing the generated plan in this ofﬁce environment are provided on our project site2.

Home: An existing 3D scene graph from the Stanford 3D Scene Graph dataset [11] which consists of a family home environment (Klickitat) spanning 28 rooms across 3 ﬂoors and contains 112 assets and objects that the agent can interact with. A 3D visual of this environment can be viewed

The robot is equipped with a LiDAR scanner to localise the robot both within the real world and the corresponding 3DSG. All the skills or affordances including pick, place, open and close were developed using the motion controller from [44] coupled with a RGB-D vision module for grasp detection, and a behaviour tree to manage the execution of each component including failure recovery. Future work could incorporate a range of pre-trained skills (whisking, ﬂipping, spreading etc.) using imitation learning [49, 50] or reinforcement learning [51, 52] to increase the diversity of tasks that SayPlan is able to achieve.

Refrigerate the orange left on the kitchen bench.

Long-Horizon Planning 15

Long Horizon planning queries requiring multiple interactive steps

Tobi spilt soda on his desk. Help him clean up.

- Table 6: List of evaluation task instructions. We evaluate SayPlan on 90 instructions, grouped to test various aspects of the planning capabilities across large-scale scene graphs. The full instruction set is given in Appendix C.

We evaluate SayPlan across 4 instruction sets which are classiﬁed to evaluate different aspects of its

- 3D scene graph reasoning and planning capabilities as shown in Table 6:

Simple Search: Focused on evaluating the semantic search capabilities of the LLM based on queries which directly reference information in the scene graph as well as the basic graph-based reasoning capabilities of the LMM.

Complex Search: Abstract semantic search queries which require complex reasoning. The information required to solve these search tasks is not readily available in the graph and has to be inferred by the underlying LLM.

Simple Planning: Task planning queries which require the agent to perform graph search, causal reasoning and environment interaction in order to solve the task. Typically requires shorter horizon plans over single rooms.

Long Horizon Planning: Long Horizon planning queries require multiple interactive steps. These queries evaluate SayPlan’s ability to reason over temporally extended instructions to investigate how well it scales to such regimes. Typically requires long horizon plans spanning multiple rooms.

The full list of instructions used and the corresponding aspect the query evaluates are given in the following tables:

#### Table 19: Causal Planning Evaluation. Task planning action sequences generated for a mobile manipulator robot to follow for both the simple and long-horizon planning instruction sets.

## H Scalability Ablation Study

In this study, we evaluate the ability of SayPlan and the underlying LLM to reason over larger-scale scene graphs. More speciﬁcally, as SayPlan’s initial input is a collapsed 3DSG, we explore how increasing the number of nodes in this base environment impacts the ability of the LLM to attend to the relevant parts of the scene graph for both semantic search and iterative replanning.

- Figure 8: Evaluating the performance of SayPlan’s causal planning capabilities as the scale of the environment increases. For the ofﬁce environment used in this study, we are primarily interested in the number of room nodes present in the collapsed form of the 3DSG.

We note here that all the failures that occurred across both semantic search and iterative replanning were a result of the LLM’s input exceeding the maximum token limits – in the case of GPT-4 this corresponded to 8192 tokens. With regard to the scalability to larger environments, this is an important observation as it indicates that the LLM’s reasoning capabilities or ability to attend to the relevant parts of the 3DSG is not signiﬁcantly impacted by the presence of ”noisy” or increasing number of nodes. One potential downside to larger environments however is the increased number of steps required before semantic search converges. As more semantically relevant ﬂoor or room nodes enter the scene, each one of these may be considered by the LLM for exploration.

## J Input Prompt Structure

Input prompt passed to the LLM for SayPlan. Note that the components highlighted in violet represent static components of the prompt that remain ﬁxed throughout both the semantic search and iterative replanning phases of SayPlan.

Agent Role: You are an excellent graph planning agent. Given a graph representation of an environment, you can explore the graph by expanding nodes to find the items of interest. You can then use this graph to generate a step-by-step task plan that the agent can follow to solve a given instruction. Environment Functions: goto(<pose>): Move the agent to any room node or pose node. access(<asset>): Provide access to the set of affordances associated with an asset node and its connected objects. pickup(<object>): Pick up an accessible object from the accessed node. release(<object>): Release grasped object at an asset node. turn_on/off(<object>): Toggle object at agent’s node, if accessible and has affordance. open/close(<asset>): Open/close asset at agent’s node, affecting object accessibility. done(): Call when the task is completed. Environment State: ontop_of(<asset>): Object is located on <asset> inside_of(<asset>): Object is located inside <asset> inside_hand: Object is currently being grasped by the robot/agent closed: Asset can be opened open: Asset can be closed or kept open on: Asset is currently on off: Asset is currently off accessible: The object is not accessible if it is inside an asset and the asset state is "closed". Environment API:

expand_node(<node>): Reveal assets/objects connected to a room/floor node. contract_node(<node>): Hide assets/objects, reducing graph size for memory constraints.

verify_plan(): Verify generated plan in the scene graph environment. Output Response Format: {chain_of_thought: break your problem down into a series of intermediate reasoning steps to help you determine your next command, reasoning: justify why the next action is important mode: "exploring" OR "planning" command: {‘‘command_name": Environment API call

"node_name": node to perform an operation on "plan": task plan if in planning mode}}

Example: <see Appendix K and L> Instruction: Natural language description of the task 3D Scene Graph: Text-serialised JSON description of a 3D scene graph Memory: History of previously expanded nodes Feedback: External textual feedback from scene graph simulator Ensure the response can be parsed by Python json.loads.
