ABSTRACT

Text embedding models serve as a fundamental component in real-world search applications. By mapping queries and documents into a shared embedding space, they deliver competitive retrieval performance with high efficiency. However, their ranking fidelity remains limited compared to dedicated rerankers, especially recent LLM-based listwise rerankers, which capture fine-grained query-document and document-document interactions. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective unified framework E2RANK, means Efficient Embedding-based Ranking (also means Embedding-to-Rank), which extends a single text embedding model to perform both high-quality retrieval and listwise reranking through continued training under a listwise ranking objective, thereby achieving strong effectiveness with remarkable efficiency. By applying cosine similarity between the query and document embeddings as a unified ranking function, the listwise ranking prompt, which is constructed from the original query and its candidate documents, serves as an enhanced query enriched with signals from the top-K documents, akin to pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) in traditional retrieval models. This design preserves the efficiency and representational quality of the base embedding model while significantly improving its reranking performance. Empirically, E2RANK achieves state-of-the-art results on the BEIR reranking benchmark and demonstrates competitive performance on the reasoning-intensive BRIGHT benchmark, with very low reranking latency. We also show that the ranking training process improves embedding performance on the MTEB benchmark. Our findings indicate that a single embedding model can effectively unify retrieval and reranking, offering both computational efficiency and competitive ranking accuracy.

- 1 INTRODUCTION

Text embedding and reranking are fundamental components in numerous natural language processing (NLP) and information retrieval (IR) applications, including web search, question answering, retrieval-augmented generation, and beyond (Karpukhin et al., 2020; Zhao et al., 2024). In general, most production IR systems adopt a two-stage architecture: a lightweight embedding retriever retrieves a small candidate set, which is then reranked by a more powerful reranking model (Matveeva et al., 2006). In the first stage, text embedding offers efficient similarity search abilities by mapping queries and documents into a shared low-dimensional vector space, enabling real-time and web-scale applications (Karpukhin et al., 2020). The advent of large language models (LLMs) has further improved the retrieval performance of these embedding models (Zhu et al., 2023; Ma et al., 2023; BehnamGhader et al., 2024).

However, a performance gap persists between embedding-based retrievers and state-of-the-art rerankers, particularly those using LLMs (Zhu et al., 2023). Specifically, listwise methods like RankGPT (Sun et al., 2023) can model fine-grained interactions within the entire candidate set and capture both query-document and document-document relationships, leading to rankings that better reflect human judgment and achieving state-of-the-art results across various benchmarks (Sun et al., 2023; Pradeep et al., 2023).

Despite their effectiveness, LLM-based listwise rerankers incur high computational costs and inference latency, limiting their deployment in real-time environments. The need to encode all candidates in a single pass introduces substantial prefilling delays, while autoregressive decoding further slows the process (Liu et al., 2025b). Therefore, some recent works tried to improve the efficiency of listwise rerankers by compressing the input documents (Liu et al., 2025b) and leveraging LLM’s output logits or attention patterns to avoid expensive auto-regressive generation (Reddy et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2024b; Zhang et al., 2025b).

Among the above works, an important observation is that the auto-regressive generation paradigm adopted by RankGPT (Sun et al., 2023) is not necessary for ranking, while the interaction between query and documents in the context is critical for ranking effectiveness (Chen et al., 2024b). Additionally, Liu et al. (2025b) shows that incorporating document embeddings in the ranking process is also helpful. Based on these, we naturally raise the following question: What if incorporating the interaction signals in embedding models for reranking?

Intuitively, this question can be addressed from two complementary perspectives. From the standpoint of dense retrieval, the listwise prompt integrating both the document and the query can be viewed as a form of pseudo relevance feedback (PRF) (Xu & Croft, 1996) query in traditional IR, which can enhance the quality of query embeddings (Yu et al., 2021). Conversely, from the perspective of listwise reranking, the rich contextual information encoded in the listwise prompt enables the use of simple cosine similarity in place of autoregressive decoding. In essence, the listwise prompt can be transformed into a single PRF-enhanced query embedding, allowing reranking to be efficiently performed via cosine similarity against precomputed document embeddings. This leads to a unified scoring mechanism and a unified model that seamlessly bridges retrieval and reranking.

We then introduce E2RANK (Efficient Embedding-based Ranking or Embedding-to-Rank) and propose a two-stage process to train the unified model, shown in Figure 1. First, we train an embedding model via contrastive learning, then continue to train it under a multi-task learning framework that jointly optimizes contrastive and ranking objectives. Specifically, we use the listwise prompt

- as a pseudo query and adopt the RankNet loss (Burges et al., 2005) for optimization. This multitask approach encourages the embedding space to capture both query-document relevance and full interactions. At inference time of reranking, we only compute cosine similarity between document embeddings and the optimized query representation derived from the listwise prompt. This unified design offers advantages for both efficiency and effectiveness. First, by operating in the embedding space instead of generation, it eliminates the computational overhead of LLM-based rerankers, enabling low-latency inference suitable for large-scale applications. Second, the full interaction between query and documents and richer training signals substantially enhances reranking quality.

We evaluate E2RANK on popular reranking and embedding benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art reranking performance on BEIR (Thakur et al., 2021) and exhibits a strong performance on reasoning-intensive benchmark BRIGHT (Su et al.,

2025), while notably improving inference efficiency. Additionally, trained solely on public data, our model preserves a competitive embedding performance on MTEB (Muennighoff et al., 2022), demonstrating the effectiveness of unifying retrieval and reranking.

Our contributions are summarized as follows:

- • We reinterpret the listwise prompt as a PRF query and propose a unified framework, E2RANK, for both retrieval and reranking.
- • We propose a two-stage training process to optimize the unified model for both retrieval and listwise reranking tasks.
- • Extensive experiments show that E2RANK achieves state-of-the-art reranking performance, with significantly lower latency than existing LLM-based rerankers, while maintaining competitive retrieval performance on MTEB.

Large Language Model For Document Reranking Large language models (LLMs) like GPT4 (OpenAI, 2024) and Qwen-3 (Yang et al., 2025) have significantly advanced information retrieval, achieving state-of-the-art performance in document ranking tasks across multiple benchmarks (Sun et al., 2023; Zhu et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2024c). Existing methods generally fall into three prompting paradigms: pointwise, pairwise, and listwise. Pointwise methods evaluate each query-document pair independently, offering efficiency but lacking cross-document comparisons (Liang et al., 2022; Sachan et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2023a; Liu et al., 2024b). Pairwise methods compare document pairs for a given query to determine relative relevance (Qin et al., 2023). Listwise methods instead consider the entire candidate set simultaneously and generate a ranking list based on global relevance signals (Sun et al., 2023; Pradeep et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2024a). Recent studies further improve listwise reranking by refining prompting strategies or the method of outputting the ranking list (Reddy et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2025b; Chen et al., 2024b; Zhang et al., 2025b).

Text Embedding Models Text embeddings map queries and documents into a shared semantic space and serve as a foundation component in modern search systems. Based on pre-trained language models such as BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) and T5 (Raffel et al., 2020), they significantly improved retrieval performance over traditional methods (Karpukhin et al., 2020; Ni et al., 2021; Zhao et al., 2024), and approaches like GTE (Li et al., 2023b), E5 (Wang et al., 2022), and BGE (Xiao et al., 2023) further boosted quality via large-scale contrastive learning. More recently, LLMs have emerged as powerful backbones due to their strong semantic understanding and generalization capabilities. Representative methods include LLM2Vec (BehnamGhader et al., 2024), E5-Mistral (Wang et al., 2023), NV-Embed (Lee et al., 2025), and Qwen3-Embedding (Zhang et al., 2025c), which explore architectural modifications, training data construction, or advanced training strategies. Instruction following and in-context learning abilities of text embeddings are also studied (Su et al., 2022; Li et al., 2024a). Additionally, GritLM (Muennighoff et al., 2024) unified the embedding model and generative model through multi-task learning.

Compared to previous work, our work unifies the embedding and listwise reranking ability, which share a similar objective, in a single embedding model, considering both effectiveness and efficiency.

Pseudo Relevance Feedback for Dense Retrieval Pseudo Relevance Feedback (PRF) is an important concept in classic IR. Specifically, it is an automatic query expansion technique widely used in classic IR (Xu & Croft, 1996; Manning, 2008). After an initial retrieval, the system assumes that the top-K retrieved documents are relevant, extracts informative terms from these documents, and uses them to expand the original query for a second round of retrieval. Recent studies show the effectiveness of incorporating PRF in dense retrievers. ANCE-PRF (Yu et al., 2021) consumed the query and the top retrieved documents to learn a better query encoder, but is less robust for strong models (Li et al., 2022; 2023a). Other works leveraged PRF in rerankers, but were limited in pointwise cross-encoders and needed to generate keywords for query expansion (Li et al., 2024b; Weller et al., 2024). Compared to previous work, we first interpret and systematically study PRF in the framework of LLM-based listwise reranking instead of merely retrieval and without additional query-augmented techniques, and also demonstrate its effectiveness in this context through training under a ranking objective.

- 3 METHODOLOGY

We first review embedding-based retrieval and LLM-based listwise reranking, then present our key insight: listwise prompts can be treated as pseudo relevance feedback queries, then the cosine similarity of embeddings could be a unified ranking function, leading to a unified model E2RANK. Finally, we detail the training of E2RANK.

- 3.1 PRELIMINARY

For a LLM-based decoder-only text embedding model f and any document d, we append the special end-of-sequence token [EOS] at the end of the input sequence, and the hidden state at the position of [EOS] from the final decoder layer is taken as the sequence embedding: ed = f(d,[EOS])[−1]. Further, given a query q, we append the instruction I in front of the query to ensure its instructionfollowing abilities (Su et al., 2022) and obtain the embedding eq = f(I,q,[EOS])[−1]. The relevance between the query and the document is measured by the cosine similarity between their corresponding embeddings, denoted as s(q,d) = cos(eq,ed).

While the embedding model learning encodes the semantic information of a single document in the embedding space, it has not been optimized to capture nuanced differences between multiple documents. In contrast, LLM-based listwise rerankers (e.g., RankGPT (Sun et al., 2023)) use a listwise prompt that includes the query and the entire candidate set, formulated as qˆ = (I,d1,...,dk,q), where {di}ki=1 is candidate documents set. The model is then asked to output a text form permutation (e.g., “[2] > [1] > [3]...”) of the documents in decreasing order of relevance. While effective, this approach requires auto-regressive decoding or full-sequence encoding over long inputs, leading to high computational cost and latency. Moreover, the decoding process is inherently sequential and difficult to parallelize. Meanwhile, some work proposed that the auto-regressive decoding may not be necessary for listwise reranker; however, the listwise prompt containing the interaction between query and documents in the context is the most important (Chen et al., 2024b; Zhang et al., 2025b).

- 3.2 LISTWISE PROMPTS AS PSEUDO RELEVANCE FEEDBACK QUERY

Inspired by these observations, we propose to reinterpret the listwise prompt as a pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) query. Therefore, we can formulate the listwise reranking and retrieval in a unified framework. Specifically, instead of generating a ranking list auto-regressively, we start from an embedding model and use the cosine similarity of embeddings as a unified ranking function for both retrieval and reranking. Formally, for the listwise prompt, we obtain its embedding

eqˆ = f(I,d1,...,dk,q)[−1], (1) and compute s(ˆq,di) = cos(eqˆ,ed

i

) as the score for reranking. The instructions we use is similar to “Given a query and some relevant documents, rerank the documents”, detailed in the Appendix C. It should be noted that, different from text embedding, we apply chat templates for listwise prompt.

This design allows us to exploit listwise information for effectiveness without sacrificing efficiency at inference time. First, the listwise prompt provides the model with additional contextual PRF signals, allowing it to refine the query representation by implicitly leveraging document-document and query-document relationships. Second, both retrieval and reranking reduce to simple cosine similarity computations in the shared embedding space, and the document embeddings can be reused. Finally, PRF-based design enables feeding only partial candidates in LLM inputs for the full ranking, for example, including only top-20 documents in the PRF query to rerank top-100, which can further improve the efficiency.

- 3.3 TRAINING THE UNIFIED EMBEDDING AND LISTWISE RERANKING MODEL

We propose training E2RANK in two stages: first, training an embedding model, then endowing it with listwise reranking capacity.

- Stage I We start from training an LLM-based decoder-only text embedding model. In the training process, we employ standard contrastive learning to align relevant query–document pairs while pushing apart irrelevant ones. Specifically, for a training query qi, there is one positive document

d+i and a set of negative documents D−. Given a batch of N instances, we minimize the InfoNCE loss (Izacard et al., 2021):

N

e(s(q

, (2)

LInfoNCE = −

log

j∈D− e(s(qi,dj)/τ)

i=1

where τ is a temperature hyperparameter, which is set to 0.03 during training. This embedding training stage ensures that the base embedding model learns strong semantic representations suitable for large-scale retrieval.

- Stage II To incorporate the listwise reranking capabilities into the embedding model, we continue training the model using a multi-task learning framework. Basically, we include the contrastive learning with InfoNCE loss to maintain the embedding capacity of the model and a new learningto-rank loss function, RankNet (Burges et al., 2005) loss, which is a pairwise loss that measures the correctness of relative orders, for listwise ranking ability. The RankNet loss is defined as follows:

N

1 N

j<rk log(1 + e(s(q

LRankNet =

1r

i=1 dj∈D dk∈D

where D is the same set of documents as used in contrastive learning (including both positive and negative). τ is set to 0.1 in RankNet loss to scale the similarity score. rj is the rank of document dj among D, and the smaller the rank, the more relevant. For example, rj = 2 means dj ranks second among |D| documents. Following (Sun et al., 2023; Pradeep et al., 2023), we can leverage a powerful LLM to generate the full ranking permutation and obtain a set of pairwise relative relevance orders. The final training objective of stage II combines retrieval and reranking losses:

L = LInfoNCE + λLRankNet, (4) where λ is a hyperparameter that balances the two tasks, which is set to 2.0 based on our prior experiments.

- 4 EXPERIMENTS

- 4.1 EXPERIMENTAL SETUP

Base LLMs We conduct our main experiments with open-weight, instruction-tuned LLMs from the Qwen3 family (Yang et al., 2025) across different sizes, including 0.6B, 4B, and 8B.

Training Datasets At Stage I, we use the public portion of the E5 training dataset (Wang et al., 2023) with roughly 1.5 million samples, curated by Springer et al. (2025). For the second stage training, we use some of the retrieval datasets from the above mixture, as well as 2 additional public Chinese retrieval datasets from BGE-M3 training dataset (Chen et al., 2024a). We further sample instances from these datasets and construct hard negatives for each query, resulting in about 87k training samples each with 1 query, 1 positive, and 15 negatives. We also leverage Qwen3-32B for labeling the ranking permutation. For more details about the datasets, please refer to Appendix B.

Implementation Details We train the embedding model with full parameters for 1 epoch with a batch size of 512, using a learning rate of 5e-6. At the second stage, we continue to train the model for 700˜ steps with a batch size of 128, and the number of negatives is 15. We provide other hyperparameters in Appendix C.

- 4.2 RERANKING PERFORMANCE

Datasets Following Sun et al. (2023), we use TREC DL dataset (Craswell et al., 2020) and a subset of BEIR (Thakur et al., 2021) for evaluation of general reranking ability. Specifically, we conduct evaluations on 8 datasets of BEIR that contain a relatively small number of queries, including TREC Covid, NFCorpus, Touch2020, DBPedia, SciFact, Signal1M, TREC News, and Robust04. Since the rise of reasoning-intensive ranking for complex retrieval-augmented tasks like DeepResearch, we also evaluate E2RANK on BRIGHT (Su et al., 2025). We use BM25 as the first-stage retriever for TREC DL and BEIR and use ReasonIR (Shao et al., 2025) with GPT4 reason-query for BRIGHT. For all benchmarks, we rerank the top-100 candidate documents and use NDCG@10 as the metric.

Baselines In order to achieve a fair and direct comparison, we used the same base LLM to compare RankGPT-like listwise rerank with E2RANK, and finetune Qwen3 on the training data provided by Pradeep et al. (2023), denoted as RankQwen3. More training details will be provided in Appendix C. For RankQwen3, we use a sliding window strategy of window size 20 and step 10; while for our model, we only feed the top-20 documents to the listwise prompt and use its embedding to rerank the top-100. We believe that this direct comparison between E2RANK and RankQwen3 without the influence of base LLMs can provide richer insights.

For reference, we also report other baseline results on TREC DL and BEIR, including cross-encoders monoBERT (Nogueira et al., 2019), monoT5 (Nogueira et al., 2020), and RankT5 (Zhuang et al., 2023), as well as listwise LLM-based rerankers ListT5 (Yoon et al., 2024), RankZephyr (Pradeep

- et al., 2023), and RankGPT (Sun et al., 2023). As for the baselines of BRIGHT, we compare E2RANK with reasoning rerankers with parameters less than 14B, including Rank-R1 (Zhuang et al., 2025), Rank1 (Weller et al., 2025), JudgeRank (Niu et al., 2024), Rearank (Zhang et al., 2025a), ERank (Cai et al., 2025), and ReasonRank (Liu et al., 2025c). Note that only RankGPT and JudgeRank are zero-shot; others are all fine-tuned, and most reasoning rerankers are trained with RL.

E2RANK consistently outperforms RankQwen3. We present the direct comparison with RankQwen3 on general reranking tasks in Table 1. Our proposed E2RANK demonstrates a clear and consistent advantage over the directly comparable RankQwen3 baseline across all model sizes on general reranking tasks, especially for the 0.6B model with an average gain of +4.06 NDCG@10, while E2RANK-4B and E2RANK-8B show smaller but stable improvements on average. As model size grows, both RankQwen3 and E2RANK improve over BM25, but E2RANK-8B achieves the best overall performance.

E2RANK achieves competitive rerank accuracy across other strong baselines. Table 2 presents broader comparisons on the TREC DL and BEIR benchmarks, and our models compete effectively with a diverse array of state-of-the-art rerankers. Compared to fine-tuned pointwise rerankers such as monoBERT and monoT5, our approach achieves significantly higher average scores, and even surpasses strong listwise baselines like RankZephyr and ListT5 on BEIR benchmarks. Notably, while RankGPT-4o remains the strongest zero-shot model, our fine-tuned 8B model secures the top performance on the DL20 dataset (71.16) and achieves the highest overall BEIR average (54.35), surpassing even much larger zero-shot models like RankGPT-4o and establishing our approach as a powerful and efficient alternative to existing fine-tuned and zero-shot methods.

Efficiency Analysis. We conduct the efficiency analysis on the Covid dataset using a single NVIDIA A100 80G GPU. The Covid dataset contains 50 test queries, and the average length of documents tokenized by Qwen3 tokenizer is approximately 350. We implement the evaluation code using vLLM (Kwon et al., 2023), a highly-efficient LLM inference infrastructure. As shown in

- Figure 1 (b), E2RANK significantly reduces inference latency across all model sizes compared to RankQwen3, achieving up to about 5× speedup at 8B while maintaining superior ranking performance. Even E2RANK-8B model is faster than RankQwen3-0.6B. Since RankQwen3 uses a sliding window strategy, it can’t use the batch inference techniques for inference, while full ranking is less effective. In contrast, E2RANK inherits the advantages of the embedding model, supports batch inference, and can encode document embeddings offline, further reducing online reranking latency. The detailed results of reranking latency are listed in Appendix D, Table 12 and 13.

E2RANK demonstrates strong performance on the BRIGHT benchmark. On the challenging BRIGHT benchmark, E2RANK delivers robust performance, as shown in Table 3. Without any RL or reasoning process, E2RANK-8B attains a highly competitive average score of 33.4, surpassing RankQwen3 and most reasoning rerankers and only underperforming ReasonRank trained on synthetic reasoning data, validating the strong generalization capabilities.

- 4.3 EMBEDDING ABILITY

Benchmark and Baselines We evaluate E2RANK on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) (Muennighoff et al., 2022). Specifically, we mainly evaluate its English v1 version, a collection of 56 datasets covering seven types of embedding tasks: classification, clustering, pairwise classification, reranking, retrieval, sentence similarity (STS), and summarization. We also leverage its English v2 version for quick evaluation and ablation studies, which is smaller and cleaner with 41 tasks. We compare our models with recent advanced open source text embedding models that are trained on public datasets, including Instructor-xl (Su et al., 2022), BGE-large-en-v1.5 (Xiao et al., 2023), GritLM (Muennighoff et al., 2024), E5 (Wang et al., 2023), EchoEmbedding (Springer et al., 2025), and LLM2Vec (BehnamGhader et al., 2024)

Results Table 4 presents the performance of E2RANK on the MTEB(Eng, v1) benchmark. When leveraging only the public dataset, E2RANK demonstrates strong embedding capabilities, while E2RANK-8B shows slight performance advantages on average compared to previous advanced models. Notably, compared with the variant with only contrastive learning, distilling from richer ranking signals will bring consistent and significant enhancements in retrieval tasks (↑ 1.58 for E2RANK8B), demonstrating the effectiveness of the ranking objective. Noticed that here we focus on general and pure embedding ability, so we do not use the listwise prompt for reranking tasks.

- 4.4 UNIFIED AND END-TO-END RETRIEVAL AND RERANKING

We also perform end-to-end ranking to evaluate if the single E2RANK model could be a unified model in the search paradigm. Specifically, we use E2RANK first to retrieve the top-100 candidate documents and then use it to rerank these documents further.

The results in Table 5 indicate that using a single E2RANK model for both retrieval and reranking leads to consistent improvements across different model scales and datasets. Notably, as the model size increases from 0.6B to 8B parameters, we observe progressive gains in end-to-end ranking performance on all benchmarks. Additionally, reranking consistently enhances the initial retrieval performance, with the E2RANK-8B achieving the best performance of 55.08 nDCG@10 on BEIR after reranking. These results demonstrate the viability of using a single unified model for both stages of the search pipeline, thereby reducing system complexity and latency while maintaining strong performance.

- 4.5 ABLATION STUDY

We evaluate the effectiveness of different training strategies and conduct ablation studies using the Qwen3-0.6B model on TREC DL20, BEIR, BRIGHT, and MTEB(eng, v2). The reranking settings and metrics are the same as in Section 4.2. The results shown in Table 6 indicate that the full training strategy achieves the best or highly competitive performance across all datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of the integrated design. For the last three lines, we use query-only embedding instead of listwise prompt for evaluation since they are not trained on it.

The first-stage contrastive learning is crucial for foundational query-document alignment and embedding ability. Its removal causes consistent performance degradation, especially on MTEB. This confirms that initial large-scale contrastive learning provides an essential foundation for subsequent ranking tasks.

The RankNet loss is the most critical element for effective ranking. Removing the RankNet loss causes the most severe performance collapse, particularly on BEIR and BRIGHT. This underscores that the pairwise ranking objective is indispensable for learning complex relevance ordering patterns.

Rank of Document

Figure 3: Score distribution of using listwise (with 20 documents) and non-listwise prompts.

The listwise prompts with documents as PRF contribute meaningfully to ranking effectiveness. If retaining the ranknet loss but removing the listwise prompt, the ranking performance will still be greatly affected (last line). This indicates that the reranking ability is mainly from the listwise prompt with PRF signals, but not the richer training labels.

- 4.6 ANALYSIS

In order to understand the reranking behaviors of E2RANK, we conduct a further analysis.

Influence of number of input documents in the listwise prompts. Figure 2 shows that when the number of input documents is small (less than 20), incorporating more documents into the listwise prompt consistently improves ranking performance. This trend can be interpreted as additional documents enriching the query with pseudo-relevance signals, allowing the model to capture the fine-grained relevance. Notably, the gains plateau after around 20 documents, indicating that the marginal benefit of adding more feedback signals diminishes once the prompt already captures sufficient relevance context, and may even bring negative benefits on different datasets.

Similarity score distribution. Figure 3 further analyzes how this pseudo relevance feedback affects the ranking behavior by comparing similarity score distributions between listwise and non-listwise settings. Specifically, we sort the reranking scores of 100 documents from high to low, and take the average of all queries for the rank position. We can see that the listwise prompts yield consistently higher similarity scores for top-ranked documents while maintaining a steeper decline for lower-ranked ones, suggesting sharper discrimination between relevant and irrelevant documents. In contrast, the query-only setting produces a flatter score distribution. This demonstrates that listwise prompts with PRF enhance E2RANK ’s ability to allocate higher scores to truly relevant documents.

Influence of different first-stage retrievers. We evaluate the E2RANK’s reranking ability under different first-stage retrievers, and detail the results in Appendix D, Table 21. Across all retrievers, E2RANK consistently improves the performance, demonstrating its generalization ability and robustness while adapting to varying initial retrieval qualities as a reranker. Additionally, this also indicates that better search results as better PRF can lead to better ranking performance.

- 5 CONCLUSION

In this paper, we propose E2RANK, a unified framework that enables a single text embedding model to perform both efficient retrieval and high-quality listwise reranking, by reformulating the listwise reranking prompt as a pseudo relevance feedback query. Extensive experiments demonstrate that E2RANK can be an independent reranker and achieve state-of-the-art reranking performance on BEIR and strong results on BRIGHT, while significantly reducing inference latency compared to existing RankGPT-like listwise rerankers. Moreover, E2RANK maintains competitive embedding capabilities on the MTEB benchmark. Our work highlights the potential of single embedding models to serve as unified retrieval-reranking engines, offering a practical, efficient, and accurate alternative to complex multi-stage ranking systems.

We only used large language models (LLMs) as auxiliary tools for grammar checking, language polishing, and logo generation. All outputs were carefully reviewed by the authors, who take full responsibility for the final manuscript.

- B TRAINING DATASET DETAILS

Dataset composition We mainly leverage the public portion of the E5 dataset (Wang et al., 2023). Specifically, for the training at Stage I, we use the sampled version with around 1.5 million samples in total, which is constructed by Springer et al. (2025) and is also used by LLM2Vec (BehnamGhader

- et al., 2024). The mixture consists of ELI5, HotpotQA, FEVER, MIRACL, MS MARCO passage ranking and document ranking, NQ, NLI, SQuAD, TriviaQA, Quora Duplicate Questions, Mr.TyDi, DuReader, and T2Ranking. Each query in the datasets has only one positive and one negative.

As for the training at Stage II, since we need more negatives to meet the training objective, the E5 dataset cannot fully meet our requirements. Therefore, we used the dataset from BGE-M3 (Chen et al., 2024a), where each query contains multiple negatives. Specifically, we mainly used the retrieval dataset from the intersection of the E5 dataset and BGE-M3 dataset, including HotpotQA, MIRACL, MSMARCO passage, NQ, TriviaQA, DuReader, and T2Ranking. In addition, we have added two widely used Chinese retrieval datasets, cMedQAv2 and MMarco Chinese, which are included in the BGE-M3 dataset. Due to the length division of the BGE-M3 dataset, we only used the parts with document lengths less than 500. Meanwhile, we filtered queries containing fewer than 15 negative examples and further downsampled the dataset. In the end, we obtained a mixed dataset containing approximately 157k samples, with each instance containing one query, one negative, and fifteen negatives.

Figure 4: Dataset distribution for training.

Producing full ranking labels using Qwen3-32B We leverage Qwen3-32B (disabled thinking mode) (Yang et al., 2025) to generate the full ranking labels for the Stage II training data. The process is similar to RankZephyr’s (Pradeep et al., 2023). Specifically, we use the instruction in Table 8 to have the model generate a ranking list in text form, and then parse the text. Then, we filter the results with the wrong output formations, which is only a very small portion of the entire dataset. The instruction used for each dataset is adapted from BehnamGhader et al. (2024), which can be found in Table 7.

Interestingly, we calculate the “accuracy” of model annotation, which refers to the frequency at which the model places the “golden positive” in the dataset at the top of its ranking. The results are shown in Figure 5. We can see that the LLM’s judgment and actual annotation of the most relevant

documents are not always consistent. Especially in the MS MARCO dataset, the consistency rate only barely exceeds half. Previous work discussed and compared using the golden label and using a reranker for labeling, but they didn’t leverage LLMs (Zhang et al., 2023b). Since the construction of the dataset is not the focus of this article, we will not discuss this discovery in detail and will leave higher-quality dataset construction schemes for future work.

- C IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS In this section, we provide a detailed introduction to our training settings.

- Stage I training All models are trained with full parameters, DeepSpeed Zero3, brain floating point (BF16) quantization, and gradient checkpointing to optimize GPU memory consumption. We train on 8 NVIDIA A100 80G GPUs with an effective batch size of 512 for 1 epoch using a maximum sequence length of 512 tokens. We use a learning rate of 2 × 10−5 and a linear learning rate warm-up for the first 300 steps.
- Stage II training For the training data, it is important to note that we do not use the full datasets introduced in Appendix B for training. Instead, for each dataset, we only sample at most 10,000 instances, leading to around 87k training instances actually.

Dataset Instruction(s)

DuReader Given a Chinese search query and some relevant documents, rerank the documents that answer the query HotpotQA Given a multi-hop question and some relevant documents, rerank the documents that answer the question MIRACL Given a question and some relevant Wikipedia documents, rerank the documents that answer the question MSMARCO Passage Given a web search query and some relevant documents, rerank the documents that answer the query NQ Given a question, retrieve Wikipedia passages that answer the question T2Ranking Given a Chinese search query and some relevant documents, rerank the documents that answer the query TriviaQA Given a question and some relevant Wikipedia documents, rerank the documents that answer the question

The instructions for the listwise prompt are listed in Table 9.

We train all models on 8 NVIDIA A100 80G GPUs with an effective batch size of 128 for 1 epoch (each instance contains multiple documents). We use DeepSpeed Zero3, BF16, and gradient checkpointing to optimize GPU memory consumption. For documents, we use a maximum length of 1024. We also use in-batch negatives. We use a learning rate initialized at 5 × 10−6 with a linear scheduler and a warmup ratio of 0.03.

Training RankQwen3 We fine-tune the Qwen3 model on the GPT-4 labeled listwise ranking dataset provided by Pradeep et al. (2023). The dataset contains 40k samples, and we train the model for 1 epoch with a batch size of 16 per device, leading to an effective batch size of 64. For different sizes, we adjust the gradient accumulation steps to fit the batch size. We use DeepSpeed and BF16 mixed precision for acceleration. The learning rate is initialized at 5 × 10−6 with a linear scheduler and a warmup ratio of 0.03. The training is performed on 4 NVIDIA A100 80G GPUs. We use LLM4Ranking Framework (Liu et al., 2025a) for training and evaluation.

Evaluation details We use the following instruction for the evaluation of all reranking tasks:

<|im start|>user Given a web search query and some relevant documents, rerank the documents that answer the query: Documents:

- [1] {document 1}
- [2] {document 2}

... [N] {document N} Search Query: {query} <|im end|> <|im start|>assistant <think>\n\n</think>\n\n

SummEval Given a news summary, retrieve other semantically similar summaries

In fact, based on our experiments, different instructions have a very small impact on performance, at least not statistically significant. So this will not affect the experimental results of the paper.

Instructions used for evaluation of MTEB When evaluating MTEB, we use the same instructions as Zhang et al. (2025c). The list of instructions for each task is listed in Table 10.

- D ADDITIONAL EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

Full comparison on BEIR with baselines We present all detailed results of baselines in Table 11, which is an extended version of Table 2. We report the results of reasoning-intensive rerankers, however, not all of them perform well on these general reranking tasks. In addition, we use the same training dataset with E2RANK to train a cross-encoder style pointwise reranker, using the same RankNet loss. We believe that the reason why them do not perform so well is due to insufficient training data. This comparison between the pointwise model and E2RANK also demonstrates the effectiveness of listwise reranking.

- Table 11: Full results on BEIR. For reasoning rerankers, the results are borrowed from Liu et al. (2025c) and only contain 7 datasets, excluding Touche2020.

Detailed efficiency analysis We listed the detailed latency results in Table 12 and Table 13. For E2RANK, we calculate the latency of encoding documents separately from other latencies, because if we use E2RANK as the retrieval model at the same time, the embedding of the document can be reused to avoid duplicate encoding.

Results of using different first-stage retrieval models We evaluate the reranking performance of E2RANK on TREC DL19 and DL20 using different first-stage retrieval models, including popular dense embedding models Contriver (Izacard et al., 2021), BGE-base (Xiao et al., 2023), and Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B (Zhang et al., 2025c), as well as an effective neural sparse retrieval model SPLADE++ED Formal et al. (2022). The full results are shown in Table 21.

Additionally, we also report the reranking results on BRIGHT, using BM25 and the original query for first-stage retrieval, as presented in Table 22.
