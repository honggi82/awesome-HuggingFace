Abstract—Training large language models (LLMs) encounters challenges in GPU memory consumption due to the high memory requirements of model states. The widely used Zero Redundancy Optimizer (ZeRO) addresses this issue through strategic sharding but introduces communication challenges at scale. To tackle this problem, we propose AMSP, a system designed to optimize ZeRO for scalable LLM training. AMSP incorporates three flexible sharding strategies: Full-Replica, Full-Sharding, and PartialSharding, and allows each component within the model states (Parameters, Gradients, Optimizer States) to independently choose a sharding strategy as well as the device mesh. We conduct a thorough analysis of communication costs, formulating an optimization problem to discover the optimal sharding strategy. Additionally, AMSP optimizes distributed LLM training by efficiently overlapping communication with computation. Evaluations demonstrate up to 52% Model FLOPs Utilization (MFU) when training the LLaMA-based model on 1024 GPUs, resulting in a 1.56 times improvement in training throughput compared to newly proposed systems like MiCS and ZeRO++.

I. INTRODUCTION

Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in various tasks, with the relationship between model size and performance often following a powerlaw relationship. Despite the prevailing trend of training giant models like GPT-3 with 175 billion parameters, recent studies indicate that optimal performance may be achieved with smaller models trained on larger datasets [1]. Emerging LLMs like LLaMA [2], featuring 7 billion to 30 billion parameters.

Training LLMs significantly demands on GPU memory, primarily due to the substantial memory consumption of model states, encompassing parameters (P), gradients (G), and optimizer states (OS). Additional memory is allocated for activations and temporary buffers. For instance, when training LLaMA-7B, a substantial 112GB of memory is required for model states, surpassing the capacity of an 80GB NVIDIA A100 GPU. To address this challenge, ZeRO, implemented in Deepspeed [3] and PyTorch FSDP [4], introduces a sharding strategy to alleviate redundant memory allocations. ZeRO1 distributes optimizer states across GPUs, ZeRO-2 further shards gradients and ZeRO-3 extends this approach to parameters, gradients, and optimizer states. This strategic sharding optimizes memory usage, enabling efficient training of large models within GPU constraints. ZeRO could work in cooperation with 3D parallelism [5] and has become widely adopted in distributed LLMs training.

ZeRO heavily relies on collective communication for effective model states management, introducing challenges in largescale LLM training due to the substantial transmission cost. In our experiments, training a LLaMA-7B model on 8 GPUs using ZeRO-1 achieves a model FLOPs utilization (MFU) of 63%, but scaling to 1024 GPUs with the same batch size results in a significant performance reduction, with the MFU dropping to 36%. The costly communication of ZeRO can be attributed to three primary factors: 1) a significant bandwidth discrepancy between inter-node and intra-node networks, 2) an increase in collective communication latency as the communication scale grows, and 3) the use of a small micro-batch size per GPU on numerous GPUs, exacerbating the computeto-communication ratio imbalance.

Several approaches have been proposed to reduce the communication overhead of ZeRO with improved memory utilization. ZeRO++ [6] achieves this by maintaining a secondary parameters shard within small subgroups, effectively reducing communication latency when collecting them. MiCS [7] shards all model states components within subgroups and replicates them across subgroups, reducing communication scale and consequently reducing communication latency, leading to enhanced training performance. Despite these efforts, when scaling LLM training to a large extent, ZeRO++ and MiCS exhibit suboptimal speedup ratios due to two factors. Firstly, the inflexible model states sharding mechanism results in suboptimal communication costs. This limitation is evident in the case of MiCS, where scaling LLaMA-7B training from 8 GPUs to 1024 GPUs leads to a significant decrease in model training performance, even falling below the efficiency of ZeRO-1. Secondly, the inefficiency of the overlap mechanism poses a challenge. For instance, an efficient implementation of MiCS with a streamlined communication-computation overlap can outperform DeepSpeed-MiCS by a factor of 2× during the training of LLaMA-13B on 1024 GPUs.

We propose AMSP for reducing the communication overhead of ZeRO for training LLMs at scale. To achieve this goal, AMSP incorporates three flexible sharding strategies—FullReplica, Full-Sharding, and Partial-Sharding—allowing each component within the model states (P, G, OS) to independently choose a sharding strategy. The introduced sharding factors (s0p × s1p,s0g × s1g,s0os × s1os) control the number of GPUs and the device mesh over which the tensors are sharded. Given this flexibility, we analyze the memory consumption

and communication costs for each sharding dimension. Then, we formulate an optimization problem aimed at discovering optimal sharding factors that minimize communication costs while adhering to the constraint of GPU memory capacity. AMSP implements an execution engine tailored for training LLMs, incorporating these flexible sharding factors to achieve optimized communication efficiency during training.

AMSP further optimizes distributed LLM training by efficiently overlapping communication with computation. When parameters sharding is enabled, AMSP employs a strategy to prefetch parameters for the next layer using AllGather during the forward pass, while simultaneously performing current layer computations. In the backward pass, AMSP strategically schedules ReduceScatter operations for gradient synchronization within each parameters sharding subgroup, avoiding conflicts and ensuring that computations continue without waiting for communications to finish. Additionally, with activation re-computation, AMSP carefully manages the additional forward computation in the backward pass, retaining prefetched parameters for immediate use. These overlapping strategies collectively reduce GPU idle time and significantly enhance the training performance of LLMs.

Extensive evaluations show a significant system performance of AMSP on training LLaMA-based models. On 1024 Nvidia Ampere GPUs, the MFU of AMSP is 51%, 52%, and 42% on LLaMA-7B, LLaMA-13B, and LLaMA-30B training. In comparison, MiCS demonstrates lower MFU values at 35%, 33%, and 29% for the same models, ZeRO++ shows the least MFU among the three, with MFU rates at merely 4%, 6%, and 5% for the 7B, 13B, and 30B models, respectively. Compared to MiCS and ZeRO++, AMSP improves the training throughput by a factor of 1.4−12.7 on 1024 GPUs for training LLaMAbased models. AMSP1 has been used for training InternLM [8] on thousands of GPUs. Our efforts also encompass an exhaustive study characterizing a six-month development workload trace of LLM collected from our GPU datacenter [9].

II. BACKGROUND

We provide a brief introduction to the essential background of LLM training and the associated challenges to improve performance. Table I gives notations used in this work.

A. LLM Architecture

LLMs like GPT-3 [10] and LLaMA [2] widely adopt the Transformer [11] architecture with multiple layers. Each Transformer layer comprises a list of modules, such as linear, multi-head-attention (MHA), and norm modules. The input and output dimensions for each Transformer layer are denoted as B × S × H, where B represents the micro-batch size, S indicates the sequence length, and H is the hidden dimension. The relationship between the model size of LLMs and their performance is typically governed by a power-law relationship. While there has been a trend to train giant models like GPT3 with 175B parameters, existing studies suggest that optimal model performance may be attained with smaller models

trained on larger datasets [1]. As illustrated in Table II, recently introduced LLMs like LLaMA and InternLM typically feature 7B to 30B parameters.

- B. Distributed LLM Training

Efficiently training LLMs at scale in GPU clusters involves utilizing 3D parallelism. Data Parallelism (DP) divides input data into chunks, distributing them across GPUs, where each GPU independently computes gradients, later synchronized through AllReduce communication [12]. Tensor Parallelism (TP) distributes parameters across GPUs along specific dimensions for parallel training. Megatron-LM employs TP to partition linear layers along the row or column dimension, integrating collective communication operations for consistent results [5]. Pipeline Parallelism (PP) evenly divides a model’s Transformer layers into multiple stages, distributing them across GPUs. A scheduler splits an input batch into micro-batches, alternating between forward and backward computations [13] [14]. Two consecutive pipeline stages exchange intermediate data through point-to-point communication.

- C. ZeRO

Training LLMs results in significant memory consumption, largely due to the occupation of GPU memory by model states, which comprise tensors containing parameters (P), gradients (G), and optimizer states (OS). The remaining memory is allocated to activations and temporary buffers. In the context of a model with Φ parameters, employing mixed precision training alongside the Adam optimizer [15], it necessitates 2Φ, 2Φ, and 12Φ bytes of GPU memory for P, G and OS, respectively. As an illustrative example, the LLaMA-7B model requires 112GB of memory for its model states, exceeding the memory capacity of an NVIDIA A100 GPU (80GB). As shown in Figure

cost across large-scale clusters presents a challenge, as it cannot be easily mitigated through computation-communication overlapping. When training a LLaMA-7B model on 8 GPUs using ZeRO-1, the model FLOPs utilization (MFU) attains 63% in our test-bed. Scaling the training to 1024 GPUs with the same batch size results in a notable performance reduction, with the MFU dropping to 36%. Similarly, scaling LLaMA13B training from 8 GPUs to 1024 GPUs with ZeRO-3 leads to a substantial MFU reduction from 47% to 4%.

Fig. 1. Overview of GPU memory allocation for model states with different strategies. ZeRO-1 and ZeRO-3 significantly reduce memory consumption for model states compared to standard data parallelism. MiCS and ZeRO++ are proposed to mitigate communication overhead, particularly cross-node communication time, in comparison to the ZeRO approach.

1, ZeRO reduces redundant memory usage for model training by sharding model states [16].

Three main factors contribute to the costly communications for large-scale LLM training with ZeRO. Firstly, there exists a notable discrepancy between inter-node network bandwidth and intra-node NVLINK bandwidth. High-performance DGXA100 nodes offer 600GB/s intra-node bidirectional bandwidth per GPU and provide 400GB/s inter-node bidirectional bandwidth per node. The bandwidth ratio between intra-node and inter-node measures at 2 in our test-bed. Secondly, the latency of collective communication operations demonstrates a positive correlation with communication scale [18] [19] [20] and illustrated in Figure 2(c). Figure 3 further illustrates a reduction in the effective bandwidth of communication operations utilized by ZeRO, scaling from 8 GPUs to 512 GPUs. Thirdly, the global batch size limitation for convergence efficiency imposes the use of a very small batch size per GPU when training on numerous GPUs. As depicted in 2 (b), the computation time of the LLaMA-7B model training linearly reduces from 8 GPUs to 512 GPUs while maintaining a consistent 4M batch size. This reduction adversely affects the compute-tocommunication ratio, leading to a communication bottleneck.

ZeRO-1 splits optimizer states across GPUs (sos>1). In the training phase, each GPU independently computes gradients through forward and backward computations, which are then synchronized across sdp GPUs using AllReduce. Each GPU updates specific portions of the model parameters. The most recent model parameters for a GPU are gathered from other GPUs using the AllGather operation. ZeRO-2 extends this approach by further sharding gradients across GPUs (sg = sos >1). Each GPU retains only the gradients corresponding to its optimizer states segment after the reduction operation.

ZeRO-3, also implemented in FSDP [4], employs the sharding strategy on model parameters, gradients, and optimizer states (sp = sg = sos > 1). Before each forward and backward computation, individual GPUs execute the AllGather operation to assemble the complete set of model parameters and subsequently discard them post-computation. The synchronization of gradients across GPUs is achieved through Reduce-Scatter. Each GPU updates its corresponding shard of model parameters using the maintained optimizer states and gradients at the end of each step.

III. CHALLENGES AND MOTIVATION

ZeRO has gained extensive adoption across various training frameworks, such as DeepSpeed [3], FSDP [4], and ColossalAI [17], owing to its user-friendly interface and scalability across hundreds of GPUs. Despite leveraging high-bandwidth RDMA networks, challenges emerge in the form of poor Quality of Service (QoS) during distributed LLM training on largescale GPU clusters. This can be mainly attributed to significant communication overhead.

- A. High Communication Overhead

ZeRO necessitates extensive usage of collective communication for managing parameters and gradients. The transmission

B. Trade-off between Communication and Memory

A trade-off exists between memory utilization and communication cost in distributed LLM training. Initially, the communication cost can be effectively reduced by diminishing the communication scale. This involves limiting communications to a smaller group of GPUs, potentially within the same node, which mitigates the overall communication cost. In addition, as depicted in Figure 2 (a), scaling ZeRO to a large scale does not yield substantial memory savings compared to a smaller size. Consequently, various approaches have been proposed to reduce communication overhead with higher memory usage.

ZeRO++ [6] keeps a secondary shard of parameters while sharding other model states across the cluster (sp=sg =sos=

GPU nodes are linked using 4 Mellanox Infiniband HDR NICs (800 Gbps bandwidth in total).

sdp), as shown in Figure 1. In the forward phase, it collects parameters across all GPUs and maintains a secondary shard of parameters within a small subgroup of GPUs, potentially within the same node. During the backward phase, it collects parameters from this secondary shard. Additionally, ZeRO++ uses quantization to compress parameters and gradients, effectively reducing inter-node communication size. Note that we would not enable configurations related to the quantization of ZeRO++ to ensure consistent model quality.

MiCS [7] and FSDP [4] facilitate the sharding of model states within a subgroup and replicate them across subgroups (sp=sg =sos<sdp), as shown in Figure 1. These approaches employ AllGather to collect parameters within a subgroup for both forward and backward computation and synchronize gradients across the cluster using ReduceScatter. Consequently, MiCS and FSDP contribute to improved training performance by effectively reducing the communication scale. It is crucial to configure an appropriate subgroup size to prevent Out-Of-Memory (OOM) errors.

C. Motivation

Despite efforts to reduce communication costs, ZeRO++ and MiCS still exhibit poor speedup ratios when scaling LLM training to a large scale. This is attributed to their inflexible model states sharding mechanism, requiring sp = sg = sos ≤ sdp in all cases. Such a configuration may not be optimal for training LLMs with diverse model sizes and hyper-parameters. In addition, the inefficiency of the overlap mechanism in ZeRO++ and MiCS also poses a challenge. For instance, when scaling LLaMA-7B training from 8 GPUs to 1024 GPUs with MiCS, MFU decreases from 50% to 35% in our test-bed. In this scenario, MiCS even exhibits lower performance than ZeRO-1, highlighting the drawbacks of the inflexible model states sharding mechanism.

In this study, the three components of model states (P, G, OS) are sharded into independent subgroups and replicated across these subgroups, following the condition sp≤sdp,sg ≤ sdp,sos≤sdp. This flexibility allows us to fine-tune the tradeoff between communication and GPU memory by configuring sp,sg,sos. By doing so, we may achieve minimal communication cost for distributed LLM training through individualized

configuration of the communication scale on P, G, and OS, while respecting GPU memory constraints.

Taking LLaMA-7B as an illustrative example, we adopt the configuration of sp = sg = 1,sos = 8 for training. In this setting, each GPU retains a complete copy of parameters and gradients, while each node stores a full copy of optimization states. During training, gradients are synchronized across clusters using AllReduce, and each GPU obtains the latest parameters within the same node through AllGather at the end of each step. In our test-bed, scaling LLaMA-7B training from 8 GPUs to 1024 GPUs with this configuration results in an acceptable MFU reduction from 64% to 51%.

IV. MODEL STATES SHARDING AND ANALYSIS

In this section, we assume that there is no tensor parallelism or pipeline parallelism during the training, which implies that stp = spp = 1. This simplification allows us to focus on the impact of the discussed sharding strategies on communication and memory aspects.

A. Performance Model of Collective Communication

The α − β cost model [21] is widely employed to characterize the performance of collective communication [22]. Taking the example of a ring-based AllReduce on p GPUs, where the input size is v, and the physical bandwidth between two GPUs is w, the input is evenly split into p chunks. In the first stage, each chunk undergoes p − 1 rounds of reduction to each GPU, constituting a ReduceScatter operation with a time complexity of trs = (p − 1)(α + w×v p), where α denotes the latency per transmission. Then, each reduced chunk at every GPU is broadcast to other GPUs, constituting an AllGather operation with the same time complexity as ReduceScatter. The overall time complexity of the ringbased AllReduce is given by tar = 2(p − 1)(α + w×v p).

However, predicting collective communication time with high accuracy using the α − β cost model is challenging in certain scenarios. First, in addition to the ring algorithm, NCCL introduces new communication algorithms like Tree [23], Collnet, CollnetDirect, and CollnetChain. Consequently, a single cost model struggles to formulate the communication time for all these algorithms. Second, In-Network Aggregation solutions are widely implemented in production GPU clusters. These solutions offload AllReduce onto network switches to accelerate and scale distributed training [24] [25] [26].

In this work, we adopt a straightforward yet effective profiling-based approach to model the performance of collective communication. Specifically, we utilize

### t(o,v,p0 × p1) = v/w(o,v,p0 × p1)

to evaluate the time consumption of a collective communication operator (o) with a given data size (v) and a specified participant GPU device mesh (p0 × p1, where p0 denotes the number of GPUs in a node, and p1 is the number of nodes). Here, w(o,v,p0 × p1) represents the effective bandwidth obtained through performance profiling on the target GPU cluster in advance, as illustrated in Figure 3. In

- Fig. 4. Optimizing model states sharding through the dependency rule. In this instance, when sp = sg = 2, there’s no need to set sos = 1 as it would store redundant optimized states, incurring additional communication costs.

cases where v is not profiled, we employ the interpolation method to predict the effective bandwidth and communication time. This work focuses on four key collective communication operations: AllReduce(AR), AllGather(AG), ReduceScatter(RS) and Broadcast(BC).

- B. Flexible Model States Sharding with Dependency Rule

We adopt three sharding strategies, namely Full-Replica, Full-Sharding, and Partial-Sharding, and provide the flexibility for each of the three components within the model states (P, G, and OS) to independently select a sharding strategy. To encapsulate these strategies, we introduce sharding factors sp = s0p × s1p, sg = s0g × s1g and sos = s0os × s1os, representing the number of GPUs and the device mesh over which the tensors of P, G, and OS are sharded, respectively. Setting the factor to 1 implies full replication of the tensor, simplifying to vanilla data parallelism if all components (P, G, and OS) choose the Full-Replica strategy. Conversely, setting the factor equal to the DP size results in complete tensor sharding, with each GPU holding 1/sdp of the tensor. For instance, in ZeRO3, all components (P, G, and OS) choose the Full-Sharding strategy. Partial-Sharding emerges when the factor falls between 1 and sdp, indicating tensor sharding across a subgroup of GPUs and replication across subgroups.

- A dependency rule is crucial when flexibly sharding the

model states to avoid unnecessary data movement and storage. Throughout the training, the framework employs local parameters for gradient computation and synchronized gradients for updating local optimizer states. If a GPU oversees extra gradients or optimizer states unrelated to its local parameters, launching additional communication becomes necessary. This incurs significant and avoidable expenses. Figure 4 illustrates an instance of this scenario, highlighting the impact when setting sp = sg = 2,sos = 1. Before independently sharding P, G, and OS, we establish the following constraints:

### R ≥ s0dp ≥ s0os ≥ s0g ≥ s0p, N ≥ s1dp ≥ s1os ≥ s1g ≥ s1p,

where s0dp and s1dp is the device mesh of DP ranks, R denotes the GPU count per node, and N is the node number. As shown

in Figure 4, adhering to the dependency avoids unnecessary data movement and storage.

C. Communication Time Analysis

In this subsection, we analyze the communication cost associated with individually partitioning parameters, gradients, and optimizer states. Figure 5 provides an overview of the inserted collective communication operations for each component.

1) Parameters Sharding: When s0p × s1p = sp > 1, the Φ parameters of a model are split into sp shards, with each GPU managing one shard. As shown in Figure 5(a), during each forward and backward pass of every micro-batch in a step, the training system orchestrates the collection of parameters shards from other GPUs to reconstruct the complete set of model weights required for computations. This is achieved using AllGather on sp GPUs. In each micro-batch of a step, after the gradients are generated during the backward phase, the training framework launches ReduceScatter to aggregate and distribute gradients across sp GPUs. The training framework performs AllGather and ReduceScatter at the granularity of a module within a Transformer layer. The input size for i-th module of a layer is 2Φi (using FP16). The communication time attributable to parameters sharding for M micro-batches of a step is given by:

K

Tp = ML

i=0

2t(AG,2Φi,s0p × s1p) + t(RS,2Φi,s0p × s1p) ,

where L denotes the number of layers and K is the number of modules of a layer.

Taking Figure 4 (a) as an example, when s0p × s1p = 2 × 1, AllGather and ReduceScatter are executed within the same node. parameters sharding allows for overlapped communication with computation. During the forward or backward computation of a module, it is feasible to execute AllGather and ReduceScatter for the subsequent module.

2) Optimizer States Sharding: When s0os × s1os = sos > 1, a total of sos GPUs collectively possess a complete duplicate of optimizer states. Following parameters sharding with sp, each parameters is stored and replicated across sdp/sp GPUs. In this configuration, optimizer states may exhibit redundancy, with sdp/sp replicas distributed across the cluster. To reduce this redundancy, we introduce a solution by allowing sos > sp, affording flexibility to reduce redundancy. In this scenario, the optimizer states for Φ/sp parameters are shared by sos/sp

a whole across devices, using a greedy algorithm to balance GPU memory usage. In this case, direct usage of AllGather is not feasible, as each GPU may not have an identical number of updated parameters. To address this, the updated parameters can be spread by broadcasting each shard separately using an NCCL group call.

While both sharding schemes remain compatible with mixprecision training using FP16, the inter-tensor approach is recommended for FP8 training [27]. This preference is pivotal since the distribution of per-tensor scaling factors becomes imperative when dealing with FP8 shards. Consequently, we adopt the inter-tensor approach in this work. Following the optimizer update stage, a series of Broadcast operations are initiated on sos/sp GPUs to disseminate updated parameters.

GPUs, forming an optimizer states sharding subgroup. Illustrated in Figure 4 (b), GPU-0 and GPU-2 share common parameters shards but maintain distinct optimizer states shards, forming an optimizer states sharding subgroup.

The training system launches 2Φ/U AllReduce operations with a specified bucket size U to synchronize gradients for a model with Φ trainable parameters (utilizing FP16). The AllReduce communication time attributed to optimizer states sharding for a given step is expressed as:

After the backward pass of the last micro-batch in a step, each GPU updates Φ/sos parameters based on the optimizer states. Before the update phase, each GPU should gather and aggregate gradients for parameters within its optimizer states. To optimize this process, we employ AllReduce on gradients across sdp/sp GPUs sharing the same set of parameters (in the amount of Φ/sp), as illustrated in Figure 5 (c). In Figure 4 (b), we execute AllReduce on GPU-0/2/4/6. Given that sos > sp, each GPU receives additional gradients not managed by its optimizer states. To resolve this issue, we employ a select & drop mechanism, enabling each GPU to exclusively select the necessary gradients from the output of the AllReduce.

For disseminating updated parameters, the training system utilizes a group of Broadcast operations. Each Broadcast operation processes an input of size 2Φ/sos on average, and the system executes sos/sp such operations.

Following the completion of parameters updates, it is essential to spread updated parameters among GPUs within the same optimizer states sharding subgroup. For example, In

optimizer states sharding facilitates the potential for overlapped communication and computation. During the backward computation of the i-th layer, we can perform AllReduce on gradients generated on layer i + 1. Simultaneously, during the forward computation of the i-th layer, it is also possible to broadcast the latest parameters (updated in the previous step) for the next layer.

- Figure 4 (b), GPU-0 should send its updated parameters to GPU-2. The choice of the collective communication primitive relies on the sharding scheme employed for optimizer states. Typically, two mechanisms govern the sharding of optimizer states across GPUs, as illustrated in Figure 6. 1) The intratensor approach involves evenly splitting a single parameters along with its states into multiple shards, which are then distributed to different GPUs. In this scenario, AllGather proves effective, ensuring that each GPU receives all updated values for parameters stored in its local memory. 2) The intertensor approach distributes each parameters and its states as

3) Gradients Sharding: When s0g × s1g = sg > 1, a total of sg GPUs collectively hold a complete copy of gradients generated at each micro-batch of every step. As depicted in Figure 4, if sg = sp, each GPU retains Φ/sp gradients, accumulating them at every micro-batch based on the parameter sharding mechanism. In this work, we introduce the flexibility

to set sg > sp to conserve GPU memory. For simplicity, we impose the following constraints on the selection of sg:

### sg ∈ {sp,sos}.

In the scenario where sg > sp, each GPU initiates an AllReduce operation on sg/sp GPUs to aggregate and distribute gradients in every micro-batch, excluding the last one. Following the aggregation, each GPU retains only the gradients allocated to it, discarding the surplus. For instance, in

- Figure 4 (c), GPU-0 and GPU-2 can employ such a select & drop mechanism to shard gradients. It is noteworthy that alternative approaches might leverage ReduceScatter to achieve similar outcomes. However, the inter-tensor approach in sharding optimizer states leads to uneven shard sizes per GPU, making ReduceScatter less suitable. Thus, we opt for AllReduce on gradients, preserving only the relevant ones. Assuming AllReduce is executed with bucket size U, the communication time attributable to gradients sharding of a step can be expressed as:

can conclude that the single-step communication time of distributed LLM training with a flexible model states sharding strategy is the sum of three components:

Tcomm(s0p,s1p,s0g,s1g,s0os,s1os) = Tp + Tg + Tos0 + Tos1 . D. GPU Memory Consumption Analysis

In the context of mixed-precision training with the Adam optimizer, the GPU memory consumed by model states during training can be expressed as the sum of memory allocated for sharded parameters, gradients, and optimization states:

2Φ s0ps1p

2Φ s0gs1g

12Φ s0oss1os

Dmodelstate(s0p,s1p,s0g,s1g,s0os,s1os) =

+

+

.

Additionally, the total GPU memory consumption, Dtotal, can be encapsulated by:

### Dtotal = Dmodelstate + Dactivation + Dtmp,

where Dactivation is the memory consumed by activations during training, and Dtmp denotes the temporary memory used by communication buffers or other transient variables. Existing methodologies [5] [16] for analyzing and predicting activation memory usage are seamlessly integrated into our present study.

V. SYSTEM DESIGN & COMMUNICATION OVERLAP

To reduce the communication overhead of ZeRO for efficient LLM training, we introduce AMSP. It leverages an expanded model states sharding space and is adept at identifying the most communication-efficient factors. We focus on how AMSP systematically optimizes the training performance with a flexible model states sharding strategy.

Figure 7 illustrates the two components of AMSP: the Planner and the Executor. (1) The Planner identifies the optimal solution for model states sharding. This component integrates three modules: the Pre-Filter, narrowing the search space based on specific rules; the Communication-Profiler, offering predictions for collective communication time; and the Solver, constructed by a memory and communication cost model to identify the optimal strategy. (2) The Executor is accountable for executing LLM training using the selected strategy. This component integrates two essential modules to enhance communication efficiency. The Communication Overlap strategy offers a fine-grained overlap for computation and communication. Moreover, AMSP employs the topology-aware Communication Placement strategy to reduce network communication across spine switches, enhancing overall efficiency.

Workflow. 1 AMSP begins by having users define LLM architecture, specifying metadata such as layer number and sequence length, along with hyper-parameters like micro-batch size and micro-batch number. Users also provide settings for the training cluster, including the total number of GPUs and GPU memory capacity. 2 The Planner eliminates certain strategies that may incur additional communication costs, resulting in a set of alternative strategies. The CommunicationProfiler, operating offline, provides communication time data, aiding the Planner in estimating step time for these alternatives. 3 Using an optimization problem solver, the Planner identifies the optimal strategy. 4 Subsequently, the Executor runs the training job using the chosen strategy, enhanced by Communication Overlap and topology-aware Communication Placement strategy.

AMSP utilizes real-system profiling to ascertain the effective bandwidth of three used collective communication operations (i.e., AllGather, ReduceScatter, AllReduce and Broadcast) across diverse communication sizes and device meshes. Consequently, AMSP estimates the communication latency induced by model states sharding.

Fig. 9. Overlapping strategy for parameters sharding and corresponding control hooks. (a) illustrates the concurrent execution of AllGather for prefetching parameters with the forward computation. (b) presents the overlap of AllGather and ReduceScatter with backward computation. (c) demonstrates the communiction-computation overlap strategy during the backward phase when activation recomputation is enabled.

Fig. 8. Example of sharding model states within the same node. In (a) assigning s0p = 1, s1p = 2 results in increased cross-node communication caused by AllGather and ReduceScatter. In (b) with sos = 2, setting s0os = 1, s1os = 2 creates cross-node Broadcast.

- B. Execution Planner

The Execution Planner generates the optimal combination strategy for the input model with the provided hardware information. AMSP formulates an optimization problem to search for the optimal {s0p,s1p,s0g,s1g,s0os,s1os} by minimizing the sum of communication costs subject to memory constraints. The integer programming problem is defined as follows:

Minimize Tcomm(s0p,s1p,s0g,s1g,s0os,s1os) (1) Subject to Dtotal ≤ GPU_Memory_Capacity (2)

- 1 ≤ s0p ≤ s0g ≤ s0os ≤ s0dp ≤ R (3)
- 1 ≤ s1p ≤ s1g ≤ s1os ≤ s1dp ≤ N (4) s0i × k = s0dp, k ∈ Z, i ∈ {p,g,os} (5) s1j × k = s1dp, k ∈ Z, j ∈ {p,g,os} (6) s0i = s0dp, if s1i > 1, i ∈ {p,g,os} (7)

This problem minimizes the communication cost of LLM training with respect to the GPU memory capacity (Equation 2) and the dependency rules outlined in Section IV-B (Equation 3, 4). Instead of exhaustively iterating through all possible solutions for {s0p,s1p,s0g,s1g,s0os,s1os}, we optimize the efficiency of assignment strategy exploration by incorporating two filters. Firstly, s0dp should be divisible by s0p,g,os (Equation

- 5), ensuring the participation of all GPUs within a node in

the training process. Additionally, s1dp should be divisible by s1p,g,os (Equation 6), allowing for the utilization of all nodes in the training. Secondly, to minimize cross-node communication (Equation 7), a priority is placed on employing fewer nodes when sharding P, G, and OS independently. For instance, in Figure 8(a), selecting (s0p = 1,s1p = 2) necessitates launching AllGather and ReduceScatter on two nodes

every micro-batch, while opting for (s0p = 2,s1p = 1) results in reduced cross-node communication costs. In Figure 8(b),

setting (s0os = 1,s1os = 2) induces cross-node AllGather for spreading updated parameters per step, whereas (s0os = 2,s1os = 1) confines this communication within a node. Based on these filters, AMSP can efficiently employ a brute-force search method to obtain the optimal solution, effectively navigating the solution space with reduced complexity.

C. Computation-Communication Overlap

AMSP uses specific hooks of PyTorch 2.1, as detailed in Table III, to facilitate the necessary NCCL communications for sharding P, G, and OS. Timely initiation of these operations is important for ensuring both correctness and efficiency.

TABLE III HOOKS USED BY AMSP

Module Hook Name

torch.nn.modules register_forward_hook torch.nn.modules register_forward_pre_hook torch.nn.modules register_full_backward_hook torch.nn.modules register_full_backward_pre_hook torch.Tensor register_hook

1) Overlap for Parameters Sharding: As shown in Figure 9 (a), prior to initiating the forward computation in a layer, a sequence of AllGather operations is launched to proactively fetch parameters for each module (such as linear modules) of the subsequent layer. This strategic prefetching enables AMSP to seamlessly overlap the computation of the current layer with communication tasks for the next layer, enhancing overall efficiency. To coordinate this process for each module, AMSP leverages register_forward_pre_hook to await the

completion of the corresponding AllGather. Upon concluding the forward computation for a module, AMSP releases gathered parameters, triggered by register_forward_hook.

In the backward pass, each module within a layer computes gradients for both its weights (GradWeight) and its input (GradInput). After the computation of GradWeight, AMSP initiates ReduceScatter on it for gradients distribution and synchronization. In scenarios without activation recomputation, launching all AllGather operations simultaneously to fetch parameters of modules in the next layer is not optimal. This is because such operations would obstruct the execution of ReduceScatter, leading to sub-optimal training performance. To address this challenge, we adopt a more strategic approach by fetching parameters of only the next module, triggered by register_backward_pre_hook. Consequently, as shown in Figure 9 (b), AMSP efficiently overlaps AllGather with the computation of GradWeight. AMSP also overlaps ReduceScatter with the computation of GradInput. Furthermore, we decouple the life-cycle of ReduceScatter from the backward function. In cases where the ReduceScatter operation is not completed by the time GradInput computation concludes, AMSP seamlessly proceeds to the backward computation of the next module instead of causing unnecessary blocking.

Fig. 10. Examples of communication placement. When s1p,g,os > 1, (a) depicts an instance where groups of s1p,g,os nodes are organized under the same spine switch, facilitating intra-switch communication, which is the preferred approach by AMSP. (b) showcases a scenario in which the groups of s1p,g,os nodes are distributed across different spine switches, necessitating extensive cross-switch communication.

the AccumulateGrad of parameters.

We utilize the asynchronous communication mechanism of NCCL to overlap parameters broadcast with the forward computation of the next step. It is crucial to ensure that all parameters have updated values before being used for both computation and communication. We implement two optimizations to address this challenge. Firstly, we register a hook for each module by using register_forward_pre_hook, ensuring that the parameters to be used are the most recent ones before any computation or communication takes place. Secondly, we manage the order of forward computation to align with the sequence of parameters broadcast. This synchronization ensures that the parameters used in the forward computation are the ones that have been successfully broadcasted, avoiding unnecessary blocking during the forward phase.

As we decouple the life-cycle of ReduceScatter from the backward function, the completion of the backward function does not guarantee the availability of the true gradients for the corresponding weights. Therefore, an additional post-hook is applied to the AccumulateGrad of each parameter, ensuring the completion of the corresponding ReduceScatter operation before utilizing these gradients for subsequent communication or computation tasks. Examples of such tasks include launching AllReduce operations on this data, facilitating gradient synchronization across data parallelism ranks.

3) Overlap for Gradients Sharding: In the case of sg > sp, the system initiates AllReduce operations on sg/sp GPUs for gradients aggregation and distribution in each micro-batch excluding the final one. To further enhance efficiency, a bucketing strategy, similar to the one employed for optimizer states sharding, is leveraged. The AllReduce communication process seamlessly overlaps with the backward computation, facilitated through hooks integrated into the AccumulateGrad of parameters. Following the AllReduce, a GPU rank only retains gradients pertinent to it, releasing other gradients to conserve GPU memory.

In Figure 9 (c), with the activation recomputation mechanism enabled, AMSP requires an additional forward computation for a layer during the backward pass. At the beginning of this secondary forward pass for a layer, AMSP initiates a series of AllGather operations to proactively fetch parameters for the subsequent layer. Importantly, in contrast to the first forward phase, AMSP retains the gathered parameters after the secondary forward computation for subsequent gradients computation. Following the computation of GradWeight, AMSP proceeds to initiate a ReduceScatter operation on it. AMSP efficiently overlaps both AllGather and ReduceScatter operations with computation during the backward phase.

D. Communication Placement

To further improve training performance, AMSP tries to minimize communication traffic across spine-switches within the leaf-spine network architecture, which is commonly used in current GPU data centers. Typically, GPU nodes are connected to leaf-switches, and these leaf-switches are interconnected by spine-switches. When GPUs are not under the same leaf switch, communication has to go through spine switches, leading to increased latency and potential network congestion. In this study, when s1p,g,os > 1, AMSP aims to optimize collective communications by utilizing fewer leaf switches as illustrated in Figure 10 (a), instead of incurring extensive cross-switch

2) Overlap for Optimizer States Sharding: During the backward phase of the last micro-batch, each GPU aggregates gradients for parameters within its optimizer states by using AllReduce across data parallelism ranks. To optimize this process, we implement a bucketing strategy where a parameter is placed in a bucket after its backward computation [12]. Once a bucket is full, all gradients of the parameters within it are flattened into a contiguous buffer. Then, we execute AllReduce on this buffer without blocking the backward computation of the remaining layers. This approach is triggered by hooks on

communication as shown in Figure 10 (b). For instance, with (s0p = 8,s1p = 4), AMSP strategically groups four nodes under the same leaf switches to perform collective communications like AllGather and ReduceScatter. This strategic approach aims to minimize inter-switch communication latency, thereby reducing the additional communication overhead introduced by the sharding of model states.

VI. EVALUATION

- A. Experimental Setup

1) Implementation: We use an iterative solver to dynamically optimize communication costs based on the provided configuration. To uphold comparable computational performance, AMSP incorporates FlashAttention-v2 [28] and adopts mixed-precision training with BF16, aligning with baseline

systems. We also introduce a user-friendly interface enabling users to customize the sharding of P, G, and OS through predefined configurations or leverage the integrated solver to automatically determine the optimal sharding strategy.

- 2) Testbed: We evaluate the training performance of three

popular LLMs: LLaMA-7B, LLaMA-13B, and LLaMA-30B. The training is conducted on a dedicated cluster with 128 GPU servers. Each server is equipped with 8 GPUs and 128 CPU cores, resulting in a total of 1024 NVIDIA Ampere GPUs (A800). Each GPU is outfitted with 80GB of memory, interconnected through NVLink within a node, and inter-node communication is facilitated by 4 Mellanox HDR InfiniBand without SHARP.

- 3) Baselines & Evaluation Metrics: We conduct a compre-

hensive benchmark of AMSP, comparing it against DeepSpeedZeRO1, DeepSpeed-ZeRO3 [16], DeepSpeed-ZeRO++ [6], and DeepSpeed-MiCS [7]. Our evaluation focuses on key performance metrics, including Model FLOPs Utilization (MFU)2 [29] and Tokens per GPU per Second (TGS). The sequence length is held constant at 4096 tokens in all experiments. The sequence length is fixed at 4096 tokens. Micro-batch size is configured to 1 sequence with 4096 tokens, while the globalbatch size is set to 4 million tokens. The micro-batch number is 128 with 8 GPUs (i.e. M = 128); however, training with 1024 GPUs reduces the micro-batch number to 1 (i.e. M = 1). Since the core objective of AMSP is reducing communication overhead in ZeRO, we adopt s0dp = R,s1dp = N across all experiments, excluding tensor or pipeline parallelism.

2We calculate FLOPs and MFU using the formula in Megatron-LM. As detailed in [28], while the FLOPs due to attention should be halved, with causal mask, only approximately half the number of elements in attention needs computation. For consistency, we adhere to the literature formula (without dividing attention FLOPs by 2) as in FlashAttention and many other libraries.

4) System Configurations: Table IV presents the configurations utilized in AMSP and the baselines. AMSP maintains a uniform set of configurations when scaling training from 8 GPUs to 1024 GPUs. In ZeRO++, the secondary shard number of the parameters is tuned for optimal performance, with (s0p = 8,s1p = 1), and quantization is not enabled. Activation recomputation is applied during the training of LLaMA-30B, while it is disabled for LLaMA-7B and LLaMA-13B. The communication-computation overlap configurations are consistently enabled in all baselines. To ensure a fair comparison with baselines, we disabled the overlap between Broadcast and forward computation during the end-to-end system evaluations, as these baselines do not provide this function.

- B. End-to-End System Evaluation

1) Scalability Performance: Figure 11 illustrates the MFU during the training of models of varying sizes with different GPU number, while Figure 12 provides corresponding TGS results. AMSP exhibits higher performance across all cases than the basesline systems. Specifically, it achieves 51%, 52%, and 42% MFU when training LLaMA-7B, LLaMA-13B, and LLaMA-30B models with 1024 GPUs, respectively.

When training LLaMA-7B with 8 GPUs, ZeRO-1 exhibits a very similar MFU to AMSP. The observation indicates that both systems achieve comparable computation efficiency. This similarity arises from the fact that they share the same communication cost. Importantly, this result underscores that AMSP, despite introducing innovative communication optimizations, maintains a comparable level of computation efficiency with baseline systems, given the commonality in utilizing the same computation engine, such as FlashAttention.

As the GPU number increases, AMSP demonstrates a comparatively stable decrease in MFU and TGS across LLaMA7B, LLaMA-13B and LLaMA-30B models when compared to

[Figure 1]

other baselines. Expanding from 8 to 1024 GPUs, AMSP experiences a modest 15% reduction in MFU, while ZeRO-3 can exhibit reductions of up to 88%. The decrease in AMSP’s MFU is attributed to the reduced computational load per GPU as the number of GPUs grows, leading to a higher communicationto-compute ratio. Notably, the MiCS approach, which employs a subgroup communication strategy, also exhibits a relatively gentle downward trend, similar to AMSP. However, due to its limited array of configuration options, MiCS consistently maintains an MFU below that of AMSP. Zero++, while often outperforming ZeRO-3, faces challenges such as out-ofmemory (OOM) issues. For instance, when training LLaMA30B on 32 GPUs, Zero++ encountered an OOM situation, whereas other methods achieved an MFU of around 40%.

When training LLaMA-7B on 1024 GPUs, AMSP achieves MFU 51%, surpassing other baselines. ZeRO-1 follows closely with 36% MFU, while MiCS ranks third at 35%. ZeRO-3 and ZeRO++ lag significantly behind, achieving approximately 4% MFU. In comparison to ZeRO-1, AMSP effectively constrains the Broadcast operation, which is used to disseminate updated parameters to other GPUs at the end of each step, involving only 8 GPUs. This strategic approach minimizes communication overhead. On the other hand, MiCS also reduces the communication scale of AllGather and ReduceScatter within a node for parameters fetch and gradients distribution, yet it generates more traffic than AMSP. Consequently, MiCS exhibits lower performer compared to ZeRO-1 when training LLaMA-7B on 1024 GPUs. For LLaMA-13B and LLaMA30B training on 1024 GPUs, AMSP maintains its leading position with MFU values of 51% and 43%, respectively. MiCS follows with 33% for LLaMA-13B and 29% for LLaMA-30B.

[Figure 2]

- Fig. 15. Training trace segment for LLaMA-7B, LLaMA-13B, and LLaMA-30B models using AMSP. This trace encompasses both the forward and backward phases of a training step. LLaMA-7B and LLaMA-13B are trained with a micro-batch size of 4096 tokens and a micro-batch number of 2 on 32 GPUs, while LLaMA-30B utilizes 64 GPUs for training.

2) GPU Memory Analysis: Figure 13 illustrates the maximum allocated memory during training for various systems. ZeRO-3 stands out as the most memory-efficient, primarily due to its aggressive splitting of model states across all GPUs. The memory consumption of ZeRO-3 becomes stable in largescale training. For instance, when scaling from 512 GPUs to 1024 GPUs, the memory consumption for training LLaMA30B changes from 16GB to 15GB with ZeRO-3. Both ZeRO++ and MiCS demonstrate enhanced training performance at the expense of higher memory consumption. MiCS, in particular, prioritizes redundant storage to optimize communication efficiency, resulting in approximately double the memory usage compared to ZeRO-3 for the same models on 1024 GPUs. This trade-off highlights the strategic use of memory resources to achieve superior training outcomes with these approaches.

AMSP consistently exhibits high memory consumption, particularly noticeable when comparing it to MiCS. For instance,

when training the 7B model on 1024 GPUs, AMSP’s memory footprint is twice that of MiCS, despite achieving a more efficient utilization of memory. Although AMSP and MiCS demonstrate similar memory consumption for the 13B and 30B models, their memory utilization compositions vary. AMSP attains higher training efficiency by dynamically managing the memory allocation of parameters, gradients and optimizer states. This dynamic allocation strategy allows AMSP to optimize memory usage effectively, contributing to its superior training efficiency despite the higher memory footprint.

C. Performance Gap Analysis

Our investigation reveals that the superior training performance of AMSP can be attributed to two crucial optimizations: a flexible sharding strategy for parameters, gradients, and optimizer states, and an advanced methodology for orchestrating the overlap between communication and com-

putation. Our findings underscore that existing implementations of ZeRO-3, MiCS, and ZeRO++ within the DeepSpeed framework encounter significant hurdles in achieving effective overlap between communication and computation, particularly during the backward phases. This challenge is notably evident in the inefficient utilization of idle compute resources during the ReduceScatter communications in ZeRO-3 and ZeRO++, as well as the combined ReduceScatter and AllReduce communications in MiCS, as depicted in Figure 14. In this figure, we present a trace segment for the LLaMA-7B model training on 32 GPUs with a micro-batch size of 4096 tokens using DeepSpeedZeRO3/MiCS/ZeRO++. This trace captures the backward phase of the last micro-batch within a step. It reveals instances of computation resource bubbles during the backward pass. Even when the communication-computation overlap setting is enabled, DeepSpeed-ZeRO3/MiCS/ZeRO++ fails to effectively overlap ReduceScatter with computation. Additionally, in DeepSpeed-MiCS, the ReduceScatter operation also blocks the concurrent execution of AllReduce. We shown the complete trace in Appendix A.

AMSP excels in orchestrating the seamless overlap of communications with computation, leading to a substantial improvement in computing resource utilization, as depicted in Figure 15. During the forward pass, as shown in Figure 15 (b) and (c), AMSP facilitates overlap by concurrently computing each layer alongside the AllGather communications necessary for acquiring the subsequent layer’s parameters. During the backward phase, AMSP skillfully overlaps AllReduce and ReduceScatter communications with computation. Moreover, AllReduce can be executed concurrently with AllGather and ReduceScatter. Additionally, AMSP synchronizes the broadcasting of updated pa-

rameters with the forward computation of the next step, as illustrated in Figure 15 (a).

D. Ablation Study

We present ablation experiments to substantiate the effectiveness of the flexible sharding strategy in AMSP,

- 1) Analysis of Sharding Strategy: We conducted experi-

ments to validate the effectiveness of our sharding strategy by comparing our Planner-based optimal configurations with MiCS’s rule-based config under the same execution engine. Figure 16 illustrates the MFU results, while Figure 17 provides corresponding TGS results. Our observations reveal that with a 1024-GPU setup, the optimal configuration for AMSP at model sizes of 7B, 13B, and 30B yields MFU values that are 1.3x, 1.1x, and 1.13x higher, respectively, compared to the MiCS configuration. Moreover, implementing MiCS under AMSP results in higher performance compared to the implementation on DeepSpeed. This improvement can be attributed to our optimizations for communication-computation overlap.

- 2) Analysis of Overlap: We conducted a series of experi-

ments to assess the efficacy of our approach in communicationcomputation overlap. Our investigation involved systematically deactivating overlap optimizations in the following sequence: initially, we disabled the overlap of Broadcast operations for spreading updated parameters. Subsequently, we turned off the overlap of AllReduce for gradient synchronization. Finally, we deactivated the overlap of AllGather and ReduceScatter in parameter sharding, resulting in a state of no overlap during the training process. The experiments were conducted using 64 GPUs, and we varied the computational loads by adjusting the micro-batch number M. The results of these experiments, showcasing the effects of overlap, are presented in Table V.

In large-scale distributed LLM training, particularly with 1024 GPUs, the limitations imposed by the global batch size necessitate setting the micro-batch number M to 1. Under such conditions, the impact of our overlap optimizations becomes significantly more pronounced. For instance, in our experiments with a 7B model, disabling the overlap of Broadcast leads to a 5% drop in MFU. Further disabling the overlap optimization for AllReduce causes an additional 16% decline in MFU. When investigating scenarios with sp > 1 and sos > 1, overlaps for Broadcast, AllReduce, AllGather, and ReduceScatter significantly contribute to MFU improvements. For the 13B model, communication overlap could enhance the overall system performance by a factor of 1.25 compared to the case without any overlap setting. Meanwhile, for the 30B model, the improvement is even more substantial, reaching a factor of 1.48. These values demonstrate the essential nature of overlap optimizations in boosting the efficiency of LLM training.

VII. RELATED WORK

Model parallelism and 3D parallelism. Model parallelism is represented by two approaches: tensor parallelism and pipeline parallelism. Tensor parallelism [5] involves partitioning specific layer weights and introducing additional AllReduce communication. Pipeline parallelism [13], [14], [30], [31] divides the layers of the model horizontally among each rank. Recent innovations have proposed methods that autonomously discern parallelism approaches by intricately melding both data and model parallelism for distinct operators within the model. To illustrate, solutions like Alpa [32], OptCNN [33], FlexFlow [34], [35], and TensorOpt [36] incorporate both data and tensor parallelism. These leverage a variety of search algorithms to refine and enhance the execution of blueprints. However, while these automated parallelism solutions focus on optimizing the sharding and placement strategies for the optimal operators within the computational graph, they overlook strategies related to the orthogonal placement of the model states.

Large-scale communication optimization. Some works [4], [18], [19], [37] try to overlap communication with computa-

tion to mitigate communication costs. ZeRO++ and Espresso [38] utilize quantization and compression techniques to reduce communication volume, albeit at the expense of precision. DEAR [39] aggregates multiple small communications using fixed-size buffers to reduce communication overheads. Hetu [40] leverages hierarchical all-to-all to minimize inter-node communication volume under poor inter-node communication. Similarly, Hybrid AllReduce [41] attempts to decompose a single collective communication primitive into a combination of multiple subgroup communications.

VIII. CONCLUSION

We propose AMSP to address the communication challenge of distributed LLM training at scale with ZeRO. The proposed AMSP introduces a novel approach by incorporating flexible sharding strategies—Full-Replica, Full-Sharding, and PartialSharding—for each component within the model states (Parameters, Gradients, and Optimizer States). The introduced sharding factors (s0p ×s1p,s0g ×s1g,s0os ×s1os) control GPU and device mesh sharding. Analyzing memory and communication costs for each dimension, AMSP formulates an optimization problem to find factors optimizing communication costs under memory constraints. Additionally, it implements an execution engine tailored for LLM training, and the customized communication and computation overlap strategy, incorporating these flexible sharding factors to achieve optimized communication efficiency during training. Compared to MiCS and ZeRO++, AMSP improves the training throughput by 1.4 − 12.7.

APPENDIX A. Trace Analysis (7B)

We present the training traces during a single step for the LLaMA-7B, LLaMA-13B, and LLaMA-30B models under the DeepSpeed framework configurations of ZeRO-3, MiCS, and ZeRO++, as well as under the AMSP framework with its optimal configuration, in Figure 18, Figure 19, and Figure 20, respectively. For this analysis, we utilized a micro batch size of 4096 tokens and a micro batch number of 2 across 32 GPUs for both the 7B and 13B models, while the training of the 30B model was conducted on 64 GPUs. Each GPU is equipped with 80GB of memory, interconnected through NVLink within a node. Inter-node communication is facilitated by 4 Mellanox HDR InfiniBand connections without SHARP.
