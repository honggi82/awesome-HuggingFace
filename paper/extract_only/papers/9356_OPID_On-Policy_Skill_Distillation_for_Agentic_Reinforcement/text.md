ABSTRACT

Outcome-based reinforcement learning provides a stable optimization backbone for language agents, but its sparse trajectory-level rewards provide little guidance on which intermediate decisions should be reinforced or suppressed. Onpolicy self-distillation offers dense token-level supervision, yet existing skillconditioned variants often rely on external skill memories or retrieved privileged context, which are costly to maintain and can be mismatched with the state distribution induced by the current policy in multi-turn interaction. We propose OPID (On-Policy Skill Distillation), a framework that extracts skill supervision directly from completed on-policy trajectories. OPID represents trajectory hindsight as hierarchical skills: episode-level skills capture global workflows or failure-avoidance rules, while step-level skills capture local decision knowledge at critical timesteps. A critical-first routing mechanism uses step-level skills when critical decisions are identified and falls back to episode-level skills as default guidance otherwise. The selected skill is injected into the interaction history, allowing the old policy to re-score the same sampled response under both original and skill-augmented contexts. The resulting log-probability shift yields a tokenlevel self-distillation advantage, which is combined with the outcome advantage for policy optimization. OPID thus preserves RL as the primary training objective while introducing dense, distribution-matched hindsight supervision. Experiments on ALFWorld, WebShop and Search-based QA demonstrate that OPID generally improves agent performance, sample efficiency, and robustness over outcome-only RL and existing skill-distillation baselines. Our code is available at https://github.com/jinyangwu/OPID/tree/main.

1 INTRODUCTION

Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as interactive agents that operate over long horizons, invoke tools, navigate environments, and adapt their behavior through multi-turn observations (Jimenez et al., 2024; Luo et al., 2025; Wu et al., 2026a; Lu et al., 2026a). Unlike singleturn reasoning, agentic tasks require sequential decisions whose consequences may only become visible after many interaction steps. This setting spans embodied household environments, web navigation, search-augmented reasoning, and software engineering agents (Shridhar et al., 2020; Yao et al., 2022; Jin et al., 2025; Jimenez et al., 2023). Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a natural post-training paradigm for such agents, since it directly optimizes policies using task-level feedback from environments or verifiers. In particular, outcome-based methods such as GRPO (Shao et al., 2024) provide a stable critic-free optimization backbone for on-policy rollouts.

Despite its effectiveness, outcome-based agentic RL offers only coarse supervision (Zhang et al., 2025). Environment rewards are typically sparse, delayed, and high-variance: a terminal reward can

indicate whether a trajectory succeeds, but not which intermediate decisions caused the outcome. This limitation is especially severe in long-horizon interaction (Chen et al., 2026; Xu et al., 2026), where a single early mistake may derail the episode, repeated invalid actions may accumulate over time, and the effect of a local decision may only be observed several turns later. As a result, purely outcome-driven optimization provides stable task-level pressure but lacks fine-grained decision-level credit assignment.

On-policy distillation and self-distillation provide complementary supervision. Rather than relying solely on trajectory-level rewards, on-policy distillation trains models on their own sampled outputs while using auxiliary teacher signals to induce token-level guidance (Gu et al., 2024a; Agarwal et al., 2024). Recent self-distillation methods remove the need for a separate teacher by comparing the same policy under different contexts, such as a standard student branch and a privileged teacher branch (Zhao et al., 2026; He et al., 2026). In agentic RL, this suggests a natural decomposition: RL remains the primary optimization backbone, while self-distillation supplies dense token-level shaping signals. Recent work such as SDAR follows this principle by treating self-distillation as a controlled auxiliary objective for multi-turn agents (Lu et al., 2026a).

A particularly promising form of privileged context is a natural-language skill. Skill-conditioned self-distillation augments the teacher branch with procedural knowledge, such as subgoal decompositions, action templates, or behavioral rules, and distills the resulting token-level preferences into the policy (Lu et al., 2026b; Wang et al., 2026; Lu et al., 2026a). However, existing skill-based methods typically rely on external skill libraries, retrieved skill files, or maintained skill memories. This design raises two challenges. First, skill memories require non-trivial maintenance, including skill insertion, refinement, deletion, and retrieval. Second, retrieved skills may be mismatched with the state distribution induced by the current policy. Such mismatch is particularly problematic for multi-turn agents, where small deviations from the assumed trajectory can lead to state drift and make an otherwise useful skill unreliable.

Based on this observation, we propose OPID (On-Policy Skill Distillation), a framework that extracts hindsight skills from completed on-policy trajectories and distills their behavioral effects back into the policy. OPID abstracts each trajectory into two complementary levels of natural-language skills: episode-level skills, which summarize trajectory-wide workflows or failure-avoidance rules, and step-level skills, which capture state-conditioned guidance at critical timesteps. This hierarchy reflects a granularity trade-off in long-horizon decision making. Episode-level skills are broad and stable but may be too coarse for pivotal states, whereas step-level skills are precise but sparse and state-specific. OPID addresses this trade-off with critical-first skill routing: it uses step-level skills

at identified critical timesteps and falls back to episode-level skills otherwise. The routed skill is injected into the agent’s interaction history, allowing the old policy to re-score the same on-policy response under both original and skill-augmented contexts. The induced token-level log-probability shift forms a skill-based self-distillation advantage, which is combined with the episode advantage for policy optimization. OPID therefore preserves outcome-based RL as the primary objective while introducing dense, on-policy hindsight supervision. At inference time, OPID requires no analyzer, external skill retrieval, or privileged context.

We evaluate OPID on ALFWorld (Shridhar et al., 2020), WebShop (Yao et al., 2022), and Searchbased QA (Jin et al., 2025) with models at different scales. Across these settings, OPID improves long-horizon agent performance over outcome-only RL and skill-distillation baselines. These results suggest that completed on-policy trajectories provide a useful source of distribution-matched hindsight supervision, enabling the policy to internalize trajectory-derived skills without relying on external skill libraries or retrieved privileged context at inference time.

Taken together, our work makes the following contributions:

- • We propose on-policy hindsight skill extraction, which treats completed trajectories sampled by the current policy as a distribution-matched source of skill supervision, avoiding the need for external skill libraries or off-policy retrieval.
- • We introduce hierarchical hindsight skills with critical-first routing, where episodelevel skills capture global workflows or failure-avoidance rules, step-level skills capture critical local decisions, and routing selects the most specific available skill for each trajectory step.
- • We integrate skill-based self-distillation into agentic RL, converting routed hindsight skills into dense token-level shaping signals while preserving outcome reward optimization as the primary training objective.
- • We empirically validate OPID on long-horizon agentic benchmarks, showing consistent improvements over outcome-only RL and skill-distillation baselines, along with better sample efficiency and reduced repetitive or invalid behaviors.

2 RELATED WORK

Reinforcement learning for agentic LLMs. Large language models are increasingly trained as interactive agents that operate over long horizons, invoke tools, and receive feedback from environments or verifiers (Shridhar et al., 2020; Yao et al., 2022; Jin et al., 2025; Jimenez et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2026c). Reinforcement learning has therefore become a natural post-training paradigm, with outcome-based methods such as GRPO providing a stable critic-free objective for on-policy rollouts (Shao et al., 2024). However, agentic environments typically provide sparse and delayed rewards. A terminal outcome can indicate whether a trajectory succeeds, but it does not identify which intermediate decisions caused success or failure. OPID targets this missing credit-assignment signal: it keeps outcome-based RL as the optimization backbone, but augments it with dense decision-level supervision extracted from the policy’s own completed trajectories.

On-policy self-distillation. On-policy distillation trains a model from its own sampled outputs while using auxiliary teacher signals to provide token-level learning targets (Agarwal et al., 2024; Gu et al., 2024a). Recent self-distillation methods further remove the need for a separate teacher by comparing the same policy under different contexts or feedback conditions (Zhao et al., 2026; He et al., 2026). For multi-turn agents, this suggests a useful decomposition: RL supplies tasklevel optimization, while self-distillation supplies dense shaping signals (Lu et al., 2026a). The key question is where the privileged signal should come from. Existing methods often rely on generic revision contexts, external hints, or task-level feedback transformations. OPID instead constructs the privileged branch from hindsight skills extracted from on-policy trajectories, making the distillation signal directly tied to the states, actions, and failures encountered by the current policy.

Skill-conditioned agent learning. Natural-language skills provide compact procedural knowledge for agents, including subgoal decompositions, action templates, and failure-avoidance rules (Lu et al., 2026b; Wang et al., 2026; Lu et al., 2026a; Wu et al., 2026b). Existing skill-based methods

- Figure 2: Overview of OPID. Starting from completed on-policy trajectories, OPID extracts hierarchical hindsight skills and routes the most relevant skill to each decision, prioritizing step-level skills at critical states. The policy then re-scores the same sampled response with and without the routed skill, turning the token-wise log-probability difference into a dense skill advantage that complements the episode-level RL signal.

commonly depend on external skill libraries, retrieved skill files, or persistent skill memories. These designs can improve agent behavior, but they introduce maintenance and retrieval costs, and retrieved skills may be mismatched with the state distribution induced by the current policy. This mismatch becomes more severe in long-horizon interaction, where small deviations can lead to substantial state drift. OPID makes a different design choice: it extracts hierarchical skills directly from completed on-policy trajectories, routes them according to decision criticality, and distills their behavioral effect into the policy during training. As a result, OPID provides distribution-matched hindsight supervision without requiring skill retrieval, analyzer calls, or privileged context at inference time.

- 3 METHODS

We formulate long-horizon agentic tasks as partially observable decision processes and present OPID, a framework that converts completed on-policy trajectories into hierarchical skills and distills their behavioral effect back into the policy. OPID performs on-policy skill distillation in three stages. First, it extracts hierarchical skills from completed on-policy trajectories. Second, it routes the appropriate skill to each decision step and converts the skill effect into token-level self-distillation signals. Third, it combines these token-level skill advantages with group-relative outcome advantages for policy optimization. Figure 2 illustrates the overall pipeline.

- 3.1 PROBLEM FORMULATION We model an agentic task as a partially observable Markov decision process defined by

(S,A,O,T ,R,γ),

- where S is the latent state space, A is the action space, O is the observation space, T : S × A → S is the transition function, R : S × A → R is the reward function, and γ ∈ [0,1) is the discount

factor. At timestep t, the environment is in a hidden state st ∈ S and emits an observation ot ∈ O. The agent maintains an interaction history

##### ht = (o0,y0,o1,y1,...,ot),

where yi denotes the textual response or executable action generated at step i. The policy πθ generates the next response as

##### yt ∼ πθ(· | ht).

After executing yt, the environment transitions and returns the next observation. A completed trajectory is represented as

##### τ = {(ot,yt,rt)}Tt=0−1,

- where T is the episode length. In most agentic benchmarks, rewards are sparse and terminal, so we denote the outcome score by

##### R(τ) ∈ {0,1},

or more generally R(τ) ∈ R when the benchmark provides graded feedback. The learning objective is

##### J(πθ) = Eτ∼π

##### [R(τ)].

θ

Following GRPO-style training, for each task prompt q we sample a group of N trajectories from the current policy:

##### Gq = {τ(1),τ(2),...,τ(N)}.

- 3.2 ON-POLICY SKILL EXTRACTION

Outcome rewards reveal whether a trajectory succeeds, but not why it succeeds or fails. OPID therefore represents post-hoc trajectory knowledge as hierarchical skills extracted from completed on-policy rollouts. The hierarchy contains two complementary levels.

Episode-level skills. An episode-level skill sepτ summarizes the global behavioral pattern of a complete trajectory τ. For a successful trajectory, it captures a reusable workflow that explains how the task was solved. For a failed trajectory, it captures a failure-avoidance rule that describes what should be avoided in similar future situations. Episode-level skills are broad and stable, making them suitable as default guidance for most states.

Step-level skills. A step-level skill sstepτ,t captures local decision knowledge at timestep t. It is intended for pivotal states where the final outcome depends strongly on a specific choice, such as avoiding a repeated invalid action, selecting the next object to inspect, correcting a mistaken subgoal, or deciding when to stop exploration. Step-level skills are more precise than episode-level skills, but they are also sparse and state-dependent.

Given a completed trajectory τ, OPID reconstructs an ordered trajectory record containing the task prompt, observations, model responses, environment feedback, step indices, and terminal outcome. An LLM-based analyzer A maps this record to structured natural-language skills:

A(τ) = sepτ ,{sstepτ,t }t∈Cτ

,

where Cτ is the sparse set of critical timesteps identified by the analyzer.

- 3.3 CRITICAL-FIRST SKILL-CONDITIONED SELF-DISTILLATION

Applying the same skills to every step is suboptimal. Episode-level skills are robust but may be too coarse at decisive states, whereas step-level skills are precise but sparse. OPID therefore introduces critical-first skill routing before performing skill-conditioned self-distillation. For trajectory τ and timestep t, the routed skill is

sstepτ,t , if t ∈ Cτ, sepτ , otherwise.

sτ,t =

Equivalently, define routing masks

qτ,tstep = I[t ∈ Cτ], qτ,tep = I[t ∈/ Cτ]. The critical-first rule enforces

qτ,tstep = 1 ⇒ qτ,tep = 0,

so the two skill levels are not blindly combined. Each step receives the most appropriate granularity. After routing, OPID converts the selected skill into token-level self-distillation supervision. Let H(·,·) denote a deterministic skill-injection function that appends or prepends the routed skill to the interaction history while preserving the original state information. The skill-augmented history is

##### h˜τ,t = H(hτ,t,sτ,t).

scores the same sampled response under both the original and skill-augmented histories. For token ℓ in response yτ,t, define

The original response yτ,t is not regenerated. Instead, the old policy πθ

old

##### ℓoldτ,t,ℓ = log πθ

(yτ,t,ℓ | hτ,t,yτ,t,<ℓ), and

old

yτ,t,ℓ | h˜τ,t,yτ,t,<ℓ . The skill-based self-teacher advantage is

ℓskillτ,t,ℓ = log πθ

old

##### Askillτ,t,ℓ = ℓskillτ,t,ℓ − ℓoldτ,t,ℓ mτ,t,ℓ, where mτ,t,ℓ ∈ {0,1} is the valid response-token mask.

If Askillτ,t,ℓ > 0, the selected skill makes the token more likely under the old policy, suggesting that the token is consistent with the skill. If Askillτ,t,ℓ < 0, the skill-conditioned context assigns lower probability to the token, suggesting that the token is less aligned with the routed hindsight skill. This procedure yields dense token-level guidance without requiring an external expert action.

- 3.4 POLICY OPTIMIZATION WITH SKILL ADVANTAGE

For each rollout group Gq, let rq = {R(τ′) | τ′ ∈ Gq} denote the set of outcome rewards of all trajectories sampled for the same prompt. Following GRPO, the group mean is defined as

1 |Gq| τ

R(τ′).

µq = mean(rq) =

′∈Gq

The group standard deviation is defined as the square root of the group reward variance:

1 |Gq| τ

(R(τ′) − µq)2.

σq = std(rq) =

′∈Gq

The GRPO-style episode-relative advantage is then computed by normalizing the trajectory outcome reward within its prompt group:

R(τ) − µq σq

Aepτ =

, τ ∈ Gq. This scalar is broadcast to all valid response tokens:

Aepτ,t,ℓ = Aepτ mτ,t,ℓ.

The final OPID advantage combines group-relative outcome feedback with token-level skill supervision:

AOPIDτ,t,ℓ = Aepτ,t,ℓ + λskillAskillτ,t,ℓ. This formulation keeps outcome reward as the primary RL signal while adding token-level shaping. We optimize the standard clipped policy objective:

Lpolicy(θ) = −Eτ,t,ℓ min ρτ,t,ℓ(θ)AOPIDτ,t,ℓ,clip(ρτ,t,ℓ(θ),1 − ϵ,1 + ϵ)AOPIDτ,t,ℓ + βLKL(θ). where ρτ,t,ℓ(θ) denotes the token-level importance ratio, defined as

ρτ,t,ℓ(θ) = exp(log πθ(yτ,t,ℓ | hτ,t,yτ,t,<ℓ) − log πθ

(yτ,t,ℓ | hτ,t,yτ,t,<ℓ)).

old

The operator clip(x,1 − ϵ,1 + ϵ) truncates x to the interval [1 − ϵ,1 + ϵ], and ϵ is the clipping hyperparameter that controls the maximum allowed deviation from the old policy.

- 4 EXPERIMENT

- 4.1 EXPERIMENTAL SETTING

Benchmarks. We evaluate OPID on three representative agentic benchmarks that require multistep interaction or search-based reasoning. First, we use ALFWorld (Shridhar et al., 2020), an embodied household benchmark where an agent must complete language-specified goals through a sequence of textual actions. We report performance on six task types: Pick, Look, Clean, Heat, Cool, and Pick2. Second, we evaluate on WebShop (Yao et al., 2022), where an agent interacts with an e-commerce website to find and purchase products satisfying natural-language user requirements. Following the standard evaluation protocol, we report results on 128 test tasks. Third, we consider Search-based QA (Jin et al., 2025), where the agent answers questions by interacting with a search environment: Natural Questions (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019), TriviaQA (Joshi et al., 2017), PopQA (Mallen et al., 2023), HotpotQA (Yang et al., 2018), 2WikiMultiHopQA (Ho et al., 2020), MuSiQue (Trivedi et al., 2022), and Bamboogle (Press et al., 2023).

Baselines. We compare OPID against both prompting-based and training-based baselines. Vanilla denotes the original prompting baseline. Skill-Prompt augments the model with skill descriptions at inference or validation time. GRPO is the outcome-only on-policy RL baseline, where the policy is optimized using group-relative trajectory-level rewards (Shao et al., 2024). Skill-GRPO combines skill conditioning with GRPO-style outcome optimization. OPSD (Zhao et al., 2026), GRPO+OPSD, Skill-SD (Wang et al., 2026), RLSD (Yang et al., 2026), and SDAR (Lu et al.,

Evaluation Metrics. For ALFWorld, we report task success rate in percentage. For WebShop, we report both the normalized task score and task success rate, following the benchmark protocol. For Search-based QA, we report answer accuracy in percentage on each QA subset and the average accuracy across subsets.

Implementation Details. We conduct experiments using Qwen2.5-3B/7B-Instruct (Yang et al., 2024) and Qwen3-1.7B-Instruct (Yang et al., 2025). The training batch size is set to 16 for ALFWorld and WebShop, and 128 for Search-based QA. All models are trained for 150 steps across all environments. Full details are provided in Appendix B.

- 4.2 MAIN RESULTS

- Table 1 summarizes performance across model scales and agentic domains, revealing three key findings:

OPID consistently strengthens outcome-only RL. OPID improves over GRPO in most model– domain combinations. On Qwen2.5-3B, the gains are +9.3 points on ALFWorld (84.3 vs. 75.0), +8.6 on Search-based QA (45.0 vs. 36.4), and +10.9 on WebShop (74.2 vs. 63.3). The corresponding improvements on Qwen2.5-7B are +8.8, +7.2, and +7.1 points. The benefit is particularly pronounced for the smaller Qwen3-1.7B backbone, where OPID improves ALFWorld by +12.8 points and WebShop by +26.5 points. The only exception is Search-based QA on Qwen3-1.7B, where OPID remains close to GRPO. Overall, these results show that OPID usually provides a consistent gain over outcome-only reinforcement learning, especially on long-horizon embodied and web-shopping tasks.

OPID remains competitive with strong hybrid methods. Beyond improving over outcome-only RL, OPID also matches or surpasses strong hybrid and self-distillation baselines in several aggregate settings. On ALFWorld, OPID achieves the best average on Qwen2.5-7B and Qwen3-1.7B, outperforming the strongest baseline by +1.7 points (90.0 vs. 88.3) and +5.0 points (58.9 vs. 53.9) respectively. On Search-based QA, OPID attains the best average on both Qwen2.5 backbones, improving over the strongest baseline by +0.4 points on Qwen2.5-3B (45.0 vs. 44.6) and +0.2 points on Qwen2.5-7B (49.2 vs. 49.0). On WebShop, OPID achieves the best success rate on Qwen2.5-3B and Qwen3-1.7B, exceeding the strongest competing method by +6.2 points on Qwen3-1.7B (64.8 vs. 58.6), while remaining competitive on Qwen2.5-7B. These results show that trajectory-derived, distribution-matched skills can complement outcome supervision and compete with methods that rely on hybrid training signals or external skill contexts.

Training Data Fraction (%)

- Figure 4: Sample efficiency analysis. OPID consistently outperforms GRPO under reduced training data and approaches full-data GRPO performance using about 60% of the data.

Figure 5: Cross-domain generalization on ALFWorld Unseen. OPID improves the average success rate over GRPO and shows particularly large gains on Look and Heat.

OPID internalizes skills instead of depending on them at inference. The results further show that OPID gains from internalizing hindsight skills into the policy, rather than relying on skill prompts at inference time. Training directly with retrieved skills introduces a clear train–test context mismatch: when validation-time skills are removed, Skill-GRPO underperforms ordinary GRPO on ALFWorld at all model scales, dropping by -14.8 points on Qwen2.5-3B (60.2 vs. 75.0), -11.7 points on Qwen2.5-7B (69.5 vs. 81.2), and -25.0 points on Qwen3-1.7B (21.1 vs. 46.1). In contrast, OPID is also evaluated without any skill input, yet exceeds Skill-GRPO by +24.1, +20.5, and +37.8 points. On Search-based QA, OPID also improves over both GRPO and Skill-GRPO for the two Qwen2.5 models, with gains over GRPO of +8.6 and +7.2 points, while remaining comparable on Qwen3-1.7B. Moreover, OPID outperforms Skill-GRPO* on ALFWorld and Search-based QA for both Qwen2.5 backbones, even though Skill-GRPO* retains privileged skill context during validation. These results indicate that OPID transfers trajectory-derived hindsight knowledge into the model parameters, enabling the policy to benefit from skills without depending on external skill prompts at inference.

- 4.3 TRAINING DYNAMICS

- Figure 3 illustrates the training progression on ALFWorld. Both methods improve during early optimization, yet OPID diverges from GRPO in the middle stage and maintains superior performance throughout the remainder of training. This divergence pattern indicates that hindsight skill supervision accelerates policy refinement beyond what outcome rewards alone can achieve. The efficiency gains are equally pronounced. OPID reduces average episode length to 15-16 steps while GRPO plateaus at 17-18 steps. The concurrent rise in success and fall in trajectory length reveals a key behavioral shift: OPID agents learn to reach goals through more direct action sequences rather than exploratory detours.

These dynamics align with the intended function of hierarchical supervision. Episode-level skills establish coherent task workflows that reduce backtracking and repetition. Step-level skills provide precise guidance at critical decision points, preventing the invalid actions and local navigation errors that otherwise extend trajectories. Together, these mechanisms enable OPID to internalize both global task structure and local decision efficiency.

4.4 SAMPLE EFFICIENCY

- Figure 4 compares OPID and GRPO under different fractions of ALFWorld training data. OPID consistently improves over GRPO across all data scales, with absolute gains ranging from +9.3 to +20.3 points. The advantage is especially clear in the low- and mid-data regimes, where each trajectory carries more training value. With 60% of the data, OPID reaches 71.9, close to GRPO trained with the full dataset (75.0); with 80% of the data, it already surpasses full-data GRPO (78.9

vs. 75.0). These results indicate that OPID-style skill supervision improves the data efficiency of outcome-based RL. By converting completed trajectories into dense token-level training signals, OPID extracts additional supervision from the same environment interactions rather than relying only on terminal rewards. This makes the optimization less dependent on large numbers of rollouts and allows the policy to acquire effective behaviors with fewer samples.

- 4.5 CROSS-DOMAIN GENERALIZATION

- Figure 5 evaluates cross-domain transfer to the ALFWorld unseen split. OPID achieves an average success rate of 78.6, outperforming GRPO by +7.7 points. Its gains over GRPO are concentrated on tasks like Look (+26.7) and Heat (+18.5), while maintaining competitive performance on the remaining task types. These results suggest that OPID is not merely memorizing the observed training trajectories. Instead, the extracted skills appear to capture reusable behavioral structure, including high-level task workflows and local decision rules that remain useful under unseen environment configurations. Since the skills are distilled into the policy rather than retrieved at inference time, the improvement also indicates that OPID internalizes transferable decision knowledge into the model parameters.

- 4.6 ABLATION STUDIES AND ANALYSIS

We isolate the contributions of hierarchical skill granularity and critical-first routing using Qwen2.53B-Instruct.

Impact of Hierarchical Skills. As shown in Table 2, the complete hierarchy obtains the best aggregate performance on both domains. Removing episode-level skills decreases the ALFWorld average from 84.3 to 74.1 and the WebShop success rate from 74.2 to 67.2, confirming that global workflows and failure-avoidance rules provide an important default signal. Removing step-level skills decreases the ALFWorld average from 84.3 to 79.1 and the WebShop success rate from 74.2 to 65.6. These results demonstrate the complementarity of the two skill levels.

Impact of Critical-First Skill Routing. Table 3 compares OPID with a non-routed variant that applies the episode-level skill to every step and additionally incorporates the corresponding steplevel skill at critical timesteps, thereby superimposing the two forms of guidance. Critical-first routing improves the ALFWorld average by +6.8 points (84.3 vs. 77.5). These results show that selectively routing the most appropriate skill granularity is more effective than directly combining global and local guidance, demonstrating the importance of critical-first routing.

###### [Step 1]

- [Step 1] Observation: -= Welcome to TextWorld, ALFRED! =- You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you see a cabinet 10, a... Reasoning: I need to clean a spatula and put it on the diningtable. First, I should check where the spatula is. Since I don‘t have a list of items, I’ll start by checking the diningtable 1 to see if the spatula is already there. If it is, I can leave it there. If not, I need to look elsewhere. Looking around, the diningtable 1 is a good place to start. I'll go to the diningtable 1 and check if the spatula is there. Action: go to diningtable 1 [Choose plausible source]

- [Step 2] Observation: You arrive at diningtable 1. On the diningtable 1, you see a butterknife 1, a cup 1, a egg 1, a fork 1, a glassbottle 2, a glassbottle 1,... Reasoning: I need to clean the spatula and put it in the diningtable. The first step is to locate the spatula. Looking at the current observation, there are several spatulas on the diningtable: spatula 1, spatula 2, and spatula 3. I should take one of these spatulas. The most straightforward action is to take spatula 1 from the diningtable. Action: take spatula 1 from diningtable 1 [Find target object]

Observation: -= Welcome to TextWorld, ALFRED! =- You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you see a cabinet 10, a... Reasoning: I need to find a spatula and then put it on the dining table. First, I should check the inventory to see if I already have a spatula. Let me check the inventory. Action: inventory

###### [Step 4]

Observation: On the countertop 1, you see a apple 1, a bread 1, a cup 3, a dishsponge 1, a glassbottle 3, a knife 1, a mug 2, a winebottle 2, and a winebottle 1. Reasoning: I need to clean a spatula and put it on the dining table. Since I am currently at the countertop and see various items, I should first check if the spatula is present on the countertop. The admissible actions include \"take [item] from countertop 1\". I will take the spatula from the countertop. Action: take spatula 1 from countertop 1

###### [Hallucinated target]

[Step 10]

Observation: You arrive at sinkbasin 1. On the sinkbasin 1, you see a butterknife 2, a potato 1, and a spoon 2.

###### [Step 4]

Reasoning: I need to clean the spatula and put it on the diningtable. Since I am already at sinkbasin 1 and see a spoon 2, I should take the spoon and then go to the diningtable to place it there.

Observation: You arrive at sinkbasin 1. On the sinkbasin 1, you see a butterknife 2, a potato 1, and a spoon 2. Reasoning: I need to clean the spatula and put it in the diningtable. I already have the spatula in my inventory, and I'm at the sinkbasin. The next step is to clean the spatula using the sinkbasin. The appropriate action is to clean the spatula with the sinkbasin. Action: clean spatula 1 with sinkbasin 1 [Clean object]

Action: take spoon 2 from sinkbasin 1 [Object substitution]

###### [Step 17]

Observation: This is a clean spoon 2. Reasoning: I need to put the clean spoon 2 in the diningtable. Since the current observation states that \"This is a clean spoon 2,\" I already have the clean spoon 2. The next step is to move it to the diningtable. The admissible actions include \"move spoon 2 to diningtable 1.\" I will take this action. Action: move spoon 2 to diningtable 1 [Wrong-object completion]

###### [Step 6]

Observation: You arrive at diningtable 1. On the diningtable 1, you see a butterknife 1, a cup 1, a egg 1, a fork 1, a glassbottle 2, a glassbottle 1, a lettuce 1…

Reasoning: I need to clean the spatula and put it in the diningtable. I already have the spatula in my inventory, it's clean, and I'm at the diningtable. The next step is to put the cleaned spatula in the diningtable. The admissible actions include \"move spatula 1 to diningtable 1\". I will take that action. Action: move spatula 1 to diningtable 1 [Final placement]

[Steps 18 - 30]

The agent opens a cabinet, repeatedly returns to the sinkbasin, and only cleans the spatula at step 29. It reaches the 30-step limit before placing the cleaned spatula on the diningtable. [No final placement]

- Figure 6: Qualitative comparison on ALFWorld. For the task “clean some spatula and put it in diningtable,” the GRPO-trained agent hallucinates a nonexistent target object, substitutes a spoon for the spatula, and fails to complete the final placement within the step limit. In contrast, OPID follows a coherent locate-clean-place workflow, grounding each action in the current observation and completing the task in six steps.

Qualitative Analysis. Figure 6 illustrates an ALFWorld clean-and-place task. The GRPO-trained agent exhibits a “hallucinated target” error by attempting to take a nonexistent spatula from the countertop at Step 4. It subsequently substitutes a spoon for the target object and reaches the 30step limit before placing the cleaned spatula back on the dining table. In contrast, OPID follows a coherent locate–clean–place workflow and completes the task in six steps. This case suggests that distilling hierarchical hindsight skills from on-policy trajectories helps the agent learn both local object-grounding decisions and episode-level task workflows, thereby reducing hallucinated actions and preserving progress toward the final goal.

- 5 CONCLUSION

We presented OPID, an on-policy skill distillation framework that turns completed agent trajectories into hierarchical hindsight supervision. By extracting episode-level and step-level skills from the current policy’s own rollouts, OPID provides dense, distribution-matched token-level guidance while preserving outcome-based RL as the primary objective. Experiments across embodied, web, and search-based agentic benchmarks show that OPID improves agent learning without relying on external skill libraries, retrieval, or privileged context at inference time. More broadly, our results suggest that agent trajectories are not only samples for reward optimization, but also reusable records of decision knowledge that can be distilled back into the policy.

A THEORETICAL ANALYSIS

This section provides three results that correspond to the main design choices of OPID. We first place the proposed teacher advantage among representative on-policy distillation objectives. We then show that it implements a sampled-token reverse-KL update, characterize the benefit of collecting distillation contexts on policy, and justify critical-first routing under a natural specialization assumption.

- A.1 NOTATION AND REPRESENTATIVE ON-POLICY DISTILLATION OBJECTIVES

- A.1.1 NOTATION

Let i = (τ,t,ℓ) index a valid token position in a response. We denote the corresponding standard autoregressive context by ci = (hτ,t,yτ,t,<ℓ), and its skill-augmented counterpart by ci. At each token position, define

bi(v) ≜ πθ

old

(v | ci), qi(v) ≜ πθ

old

(v | ci), pθ,i(v) ≜ πθ(v | ci).

Here, bi is the behavior distribution used to generate the response, qi is a detached skill-conditioned teacher distribution, and pθ,i is the trainable policy evaluated under the standard context available at inference time. The observed token ai ≜ yτ,t,ℓ is sampled from bi.

We further define the token-level log-likelihood gap and the policy importance ratio as

∆i(v) ≜ log qi(v) − log bi(v), ρθ,i(v) ≜

pθ,i(v) bi(v)

. (1)

The quantity ∆i(v) measures the change in token log-probability induced by the skill-augmented context. In particular, ∆i(v) > 0 indicates that the skill-conditioned teacher assigns greater probability to token v than the behavior policy does. The OPID skill advantage associated with the observed token is therefore

Askilli = ∆i(ai). Unless otherwise stated, all expectations below are taken over valid response tokens; the response mask is consequently omitted for notational simplicity.

- A.1.2 REPRESENTATIVE ON-POLICY DISTILLATION OBJECTIVES

On-policy distillation (OPD) applies teacher supervision at autoregressive contexts generated by the student or a behavior policy, thereby reducing the context-distribution mismatch between distillation training and free-running inference (Agarwal et al., 2024). The context-generation policy and the granularity of teacher supervision are orthogonal design choices. At each on-policy context, output-space OPD objectives can be organized into three common supervision granularities: fullvocabulary, Top-K, and sampled-token distillation (Li et al., 2026; Fu et al., 2026). OPID belongs to the sampled-token category.

Full-vocabulary distribution matching. Let qi and pθ,i denote the teacher and student next-token distributions, respectively, at autoregressive context i. When the complete predictive distributions are available, OPD can minimize the forward KL, reverse KL, or a generalized Jensen–Shannon divergence (Hinton et al., 2015; Agarwal et al., 2024; Gu et al., 2024b):

LFKL(θ) = Ei[DKL(qi∥pθ,i)], LRKL(θ) = Ei[DKL(pθ,i∥qi)],

L(JSDα) (θ) = Ei αDKL(qi∥m(iα)) + (1 − α)DKL(pθ,i∥m(iα)) , m(iα) = αqi + (1 − α)pθ,i.

Forward KL gives the conventional soft-target objective and emphasizes coverage of teachersupported probability mass. Reverse KL instead penalizes student probability assigned to teacherdisfavored regions and therefore typically exhibits more mode-seeking behavior. Generalized JSD

compares both models against a mixture distribution, with α = 12 recovering the standard symmetric JSD (Kullback & Leibler, 1951; Lin, 1991).

Top-K distribution matching. Top-K OPD retains distribution-level supervision over a restricted local support. Common choices include a student-selected support (Li et al., 2026; Ye et al., 2026) and a teacher-selected support (Fu et al., 2026):

- Si,p(K) ≜ TopK(pθ,i,K),
- Si,q(K) ≜ TopK(qi,K), Si(K) ∈ Si,p(K),Si,q(K) .

For the selected support Si(K), define the restricted and renormalized distributions

pθ,i(v)1{v ∈ Si(K)} u∈Si(K) pθ,i(u)

(K) i

##### p¯S

θ,i (v) ≜

Top-K matching occupies an intermediate point between one-token and full-vocabulary supervision. It preserves multi-token information at reduced computational or communication cost, but discards probability mass outside the selected support and is therefore a truncated, support-dependent approximation to the full reverse KL.

Sampled-token distillation. At a fixed on-policy context, define the teacher–student log-ratio cost

δi(v) ≜ log pθ,i(v) − log qi(v). The token-level reverse KL can then be written exactly as an expectation over student-sampled tokens:

DKL(pθ,i∥qi) = Ea

i∼pθ,i [δi(ai)]

pθ,i(a) bi(a)

i∼bi [ρθ,i(ai)δi(ai)], ρθ,i(a) ≜

= Ea

.

The second equality requires pθ,i ≪ bi(support coverage condition). Consequently, ρθ,i(ai)δi(ai) is an importance-weighted single-sample estimator of the per-context reverse KL. Its score-function gradient is

∇θDKL(pθ,i∥qi) = Ea

i∼bi [ρθ,i(ai)sg[δi(ai)]∇θ log pθ,i(ai)],

where sg denotes stop-gradient. This connection permits sampled-token distillation to be implemented with policy-gradient or importance-weighted policy-optimization machinery (Gu et al., 2024b; Lu & Thinking Machines Lab, 2025; Oh et al., 2026). Compared with full-vocabulary matching, sampled-token supervision requires only the teacher probability of the realized token, but has higher Monte Carlo variance and uses less information from the teacher distribution.

From the clipped OPID objective to its unclipped skill surrogate. Let i = (τ,t,ℓ) index a valid rollout-token position, and let νb denote the distribution over valid token positions induced by rollouts collected from the behavior policy. Given position i, the observed token ai is sampled from bi. Recall from Eq. 1 that

pθ,i(v) bi(v)

∆i(v) = log qi(v) − log bi(v), ρθ,i(v) =

,

where bi, qi, and the resulting advantages are detached during the policy update. The skill advantage of a sampled token is

##### Askilli (ai) = ∆i(ai).

The complete OPID advantage combines the outcome and skill signals:

AOPIDi (ai) = Aepi + λskill∆i(ai). Accordingly, the implemented clipped policy loss is

##### Lpolicy(θ) = −E i∼ν

b

ai∼bi

min ρθ,i(ai)AOPIDi (ai),

clip ρθ,i(ai),1 − ϵ,1 + ϵ AOPIDi (ai) .

In a realized rollout batch, this expectation is implemented as an empirical average over the observed valid tokens ai.

Because PPO clipping is applied after the outcome and skill advantages have been combined, the clipped objective does not in general decompose into independently clipped outcome and skill losses. To isolate the skill-distillation signal studied below, we therefore consider the corresponding unclipped policy surrogate:

Lunclippolicy(θ) ≜ −E i∼ν

ρθ,i(ai)AOPIDi (ai) . Unlike the clipped objective, this loss decomposes exactly as

b

ai∼bi

Lunclippolicy(θ) = Lunclipep (θ) + Lunclipskill (θ), where

[ρθ,i(ai)Aepi ] and

Lunclipep (θ) ≜ −E i∼ν

b

ai∼bi

Lunclipskill (θ) ≜ −λskillE i∼ν

[ρθ,i(ai)∆i(ai)]. (2)

b

ai∼bi

Equation 2 is the skill-distillation loss analyzed in the next subsection. Although it is defined through the unclipped surrogate, it characterizes the local skill-induced update of the implemented PPO loss. In particular, let θ0 = θold, so that pθ

0,i(a) = 1. Since 1 lies in the interior of the clipping interval, the clipped and unclipped objectives have the same value and gradient at the behavior policy:

##### 0,i = bi and ρθ

Lclippolicy(θ0) = Lunclippolicy(θ0), ∇θLclippolicy(θ)

= ∇θLunclippolicy(θ)

θ=θ0

θ=θ0

+ ∇θLunclipskill (θ)

= ∇θLunclipep (θ) θ=θ

##### .

0

θ=θ0

Thus, Lunclipskill is exactly the skill-induced component of the first-order PPO update around the behavior policy. Away from this local region, clipping couples the outcome and skill signals through

the sign of their combined advantage, and the unclipped decomposition no longer describes the complete clipped objective globally.

- A.2 THE UNCLIPPED OPID SKILL LOSS AS A RELATIVE-KL SURROGATE

We now analyze the unclipped skill-distillation loss introduced in Eq. 2. Let νb denote the distribution over valid token positions induced by rollouts collected from the behavior policy. Throughout

this subsection, the rollout histories, routed skills, and the corresponding distributions bi and qi are detached and held fixed during the policy update.

We assume the common-support condition

##### pθ,i ≪ bi and pθ,i ≪ qi

for every i in the support of νb. This condition is satisfied by standard softmax language models with finite logits.

Recall that

pθ,i(v) bi(v)

∆i(v) ≜ log qi(v) − log bi(v), ρθ,i(v) ≜

. The unclipped OPID skill loss is

Lunclipskill (θ) ≜ −λskillEi∼ν

[ρθ,i(a)∆i(a)]. (3)

b a∼bi

In a realized rollout batch, this expectation is approximated by the empirical average over the observed valid tokens. The expectation notation in Eq. 3 makes the rollout-time token sampling law explicit for the theoretical analysis.

Define the behavior-relative KL and the student–teacher reverse-KL loss as

##### Db(θ) ≜ Ei∼ν

##### [DKL (pθ,i∥bi)], LRKL(θ) ≜ Ei∼ν

b

##### [DKL (pθ,i∥qi)].

b

- Proposition 1 (Exact relative-KL decomposition). Under the assumptions above, for every admissible θ,

Lunclipskill (θ) = λskill [LRKL(θ) − Db(θ)]. (4) Let θ0 = θold and suppose that pθ

0,i = bi for every i. Then

Lunclipskill (θ0) = λskillLRKL(θ0), (5) ∇θLunclipskill (θ)

= λskill ∇θLRKL(θ)|θ=θ0 (6)

θ=θ0

. (7)

= −λskillEi∼ν

∆i(a) ∇θ log pθ,i(a)|θ=θ

Proof. Fix a valid token position i. By the common-support assumption and a change of measure from bi to pθ,i,

pθ,i(v) qi(v) − log

λskill

pθ,i(v) log

v∈V

= λskill [DKL(pθ,i∥qi) − DKL(pθ,i∥bi)]. Averaging over i ∼ νb proves Eq. 4. At θ0, pθ

0,i = bi, and hence

##### Db(θ0) = 0.

This proves Eq. 5. Moreover, Db is differentiable and attains its global minimum at θ0, so

##### ∇θDb(θ)|θ=θ0 = 0.

Differentiating Eq. 4 therefore proves Eq. 6. Finally, because bi, qi, and ∆i are detached,

∇θLunclipskill (θ) = −λskillEi∼ν

[ρθ,i(a)∆i(a)∇θ log pθ,i(a)]. Substituting ρθ

b a∼bi

0,i(a) = 1 proves Eq. 7.

| |
|---|

Remark 1 (Why the OPID skill loss is not the direct reverse-KL loss). The scaled direct reverse-KL loss is

λskillLRKL(θ) = λskillE i∼ν

[log pθ,i(v) − log qi(v)], whereas the OPID skill loss can be written as

v∼pθ,ib

Lunclipskill (θ) = λskillE i∼ν

[log bi(v) − log qi(v)].

v∼pθ,ib

The two expressions differ because the denominator in the detached teacher advantage is the rollout policy bi, rather than the current student pθ,i. Importance weighting changes the sampling distribution from bi to pθ,i, but it does not replace log bi by log pθ,i. Consequently,

Lunclipskill (θ) − λskillLRKL(θ) = −λskillDb(θ). Thus, the OPID skill loss is an exact relative-KL loss and only a local surrogate for direct student– teacher reverse-KL matching.

This distinction also changes the global optimum. For example, consider

b =

- 1

- 2

- 1

- 2

,

, q =

1 4

- 3

- 4

,

.

For a categorical distribution p = (p1,p2),

Lunclipskill (p) λskill

- 2

- 3

= p1 log

+ p2 log 2,

which is linear in p and whose infimum is approached by concentrating all probability mass on the first token. In contrast, the direct reverse-KL loss is uniquely minimized at p = q. Therefore, the two losses cannot be identified globally.

- Corollary 1 (First-order tightness around the behavior policy). Assume that pθ,i is twice continuously differentiable in a neighborhood of θ0. For δ → 0,

Lunclipskill (θ0 + δ) = λskillLRKL(θ0 + δ) −

λskill 2

δ⊤Fbδ + o(∥δ∥2),

(8)

where

Fb ≜ Ei∼ν

b v∼bi

si(v)si(v)⊤ , si(v) ≜ ∇θ log pθ,i(v)|θ=θ

0

is the behavior-policy Fisher information averaged over rollout contexts.

Proof. By Proposition 1, the discrepancy between the scaled reverse-KL loss and the OPID skill loss is exactly λskillDb(θ). The standard local expansion of relative entropy around its reference distribution gives

Db(θ0 + δ) =

- 1

- 2

δ⊤Fbδ + o(∥δ∥2). Substituting this expansion into Eq. 4 proves Eq. 8.

| |
|---|

Equation 8 gives the precise sense in which the OPID skill loss is locally equivalent to reverse-KL distillation. At the behavior policy, the two losses have the same value and gradient after accounting for the factor λskill, while their discrepancy is second order in the policy displacement.

- Corollary 2 (Exact recovery under a matching behavior-KL penalty). Consider the regularized auxiliary loss

Laux(θ) ≜ Lunclipskill (θ) + βDb(θ). (9) Then

Laux(θ) = λskillLRKL(θ) + (β − λskill)Db(θ). (10) In particular, if β = λskill, then

Laux(θ) = λskillLRKL(θ) for every admissible θ.

Proof. Substitute Eq. 4 into Eq. 9 and collect the coefficients of Db(θ).

| |
|---|

The exact cancellation in Corollary 2 requires both (i) a KL penalty to the same behavior distribution bi, evaluated under the ordinary context, and (ii) the matching coefficient β = λskill. A KL penalty to a different reference distribution, or a different coefficient, leaves the residual behavior-relative term in Eq. 10 and is therefore not exactly equivalent to direct student–teacher reverse-KL distillation.

Relation to the implemented PPO-clipped loss. The decomposition in Proposition 1 applies exactly to the unclipped skill loss Lunclipskill . In the implemented OPID objective, PPO clipping is applied to the combined advantage

##### AOPIDi = Aepi + λskill∆i(ai),

so the complete clipped loss does not globally decompose into independently clipped outcome and skill losses.

Nevertheless, at θ0 = θold,

ρθ

0,i(a) = 1.

Since 1 lies in the interior of [1 − ϵ,1 + ϵ] for ϵ > 0, the clipped and unclipped policy losses have the same value and first derivative at the behavior policy:

Lclippolicy(θ0) = Lunclippolicy(θ0), ∇θLclippolicy(θ)

= ∇θLunclippolicy(θ)

θ=θ0

θ=θ0

+ ∇θLunclipskill (θ)

= ∇θLunclipep (θ) θ=θ

##### .

0

θ=θ0

Therefore, Eq. 6 characterizes the skill-induced component of the local PPO update. Once the policy ratio reaches a clipping boundary, however, clipping couples the outcome and skill signals through the sign of their combined advantage, and the exact relative-KL decomposition no longer applies to the complete clipped objective.

- Corollary 3 (Non-degenerate token-level signal under reward ties). Fix one context i, and parame-

terize pi = softmax(zi) using free categorical logits. Define the corresponding full-action skill loss as

Lunclipskill,i (zi) ≜ −λskill

pi(v)∆i(v).

v∈V

For λskill > 0,

∂Lunclipskill,i ∂zi(v)

[∆i(u)]). (11) At pi = bi with full support, the gradient in Eq. 11 is zero for every v if and only if qi = bi. Proof. Using

= −λskillpi(v)(∆i(v) − Eu∼p

∂pi(u) ∂zi(v)

= pi(u)(1{u = v} − pi(v)), we obtain

which proves Eq. 11. Suppose that pi = bi, bi(v) > 0 for every v, and the derivative is zero for every v. Since λskill > 0, it follows that ∆i(v) is constant over the vocabulary. Hence

##### qi(v) = ecbi(v)

for some constant c. Normalization of qi and bi implies ec = 1, and therefore qi = bi. The converse is immediate.

|---|

Corollary 3 is a per-context logit statement. It shows that even when group-relative outcome advantages vanish because all sampled trajectories receive tied rewards, a nontrivial skill-conditioned teacher still supplies a token-level learning signal whenever qi ̸= bi. With shared neural parameters, gradients from different contexts may still cancel; the result does not claim that the aggregate parameter gradient must be nonzero.

- A.3 ON-POLICY OCCUPANCY MATCHING FOR DISTILLATION

Recall that νb denotes the distribution over valid token positions induced by rollouts collected from the behavior policy. Let db denote the corresponding distribution over ordinary autoregressive contexts ci, i.e., the context marginal induced by i ∼ νb. For an arbitrary data-collection policy µ, let dµ denote the analogous context distribution.

We define total variation as

- 1

- 2 |dP − dQ|.

TV(P,Q) ≜ sup

|P(A) − Q(A)| =

A

The following result isolates the effect of changing only the distribution of ordinary autoregressive contexts. It applies to both nonnegative distillation losses and signed surrogate losses.

- Proposition 2 (On-policy occupancy matching). Let ℓθ : C → [mℓ,Mℓ] be a measurable percontext loss, where −∞ < mℓ < Mℓ < +∞. Then

Ec∼d

##### [ℓθ(c)] − Ec∼d

[ℓθ(c)] ≤ (Mℓ − mℓ)TV(db,dµ) ≤ (Mℓ − mℓ)

DKL(db∥dµ).

In particular, if dµ = db, then the context-occupancy mismatch is exactly zero. Proof. Define

ℓθ(c) − mℓ Mℓ − mℓ

fθ(c) ≜

.

Then 0 ≤ fθ(c) ≤ 1. By the variational characterization of total variation over measurable functions with range in [0,1],

##### Ed

##### [fθ] − Ed

##### [fθ] ≤ TV(db,dµ).

Multiplying both sides by Mℓ − mℓ proves the first inequality in Eq. 12. The second inequality follows from Pinsker’s inequality. If db is not absolutely continuous with respect to dµ, then DKL(db∥dµ) = +∞, and the inequality remains valid in the extended-real sense. Setting dµ = db proves the final statement.

| |
|---|

For example, Proposition 2 can be applied to the per-context reverse-KL loss

##### ℓRKL,θ(ci) ≜ DKL (pθ,i∥qi),

which is the distribution-matching loss locally approximated by the OPID skill update. It can also be applied to a bounded version of the signed per-context OPID skill loss

ℓunclipskill,θ(ci) ≜ −λskillEa∼b

[ρθ,i(a)∆i(a)]

(13)

i

= λskill [DKL (pθ,i∥qi) − DKL (pθ,i∥bi)].

Because the loss in Eq. 13 is signed and need not be uniformly bounded for arbitrary probability distributions, applying Proposition 2 to it requires an explicit bounded-range condition, such as probability flooring, log-ratio clipping, or restriction to a compact parameter neighborhood. More general versions can instead be obtained under appropriate moment or tail conditions.

- Proposition 2 controls only the mismatch in the outer distribution of ordinary autoregressive contexts. It assumes that the same per-context loss map is evaluated under db and dµ. It does not by itself control changes in the hindsight skill, the routed teacher qi, or other trajectory-dependent quantities that may also change with the data-collection policy.

- A.4 CRITICAL-FIRST HIERARCHICAL ROUTING

We next formalize how the episode-level and step-level skills determine the detached teacher qi used in Lunclipskill .

Let qi⋆ denote an ideal privileged teacher at token position i. Let qiep and qistep denote the teachers induced by the episode-level and step-level skills, respectively. Let

##### zi⋆ ∈ {0,1}

be an oracle criticality indicator, where zi⋆ = 1 means that the step-level teacher is the appropriate specialized teacher. The analyzer prediction is

zi ≜ 1{t ∈ Cτ}. The critical-first routing rule defines

##### qiroute ≜ ziqistep + (1 − zi)qiep, qi ≡ qiroute. (14)

Thus, the qi appearing in the OPID skill advantage ∆i(v) = log qi(v) − log bi(v) is precisely the routed teacher in Eq. 14.

Measure the approximation errors of the two candidate teachers by

Eiep ≜ DKL (qi⋆∥qiep), Eistep ≜ DKL qi⋆∥qistep , Eiroute ≜ DKL qi⋆∥qiroute .

Because the routing decision is hard,

(15)

##### Eiroute = ziEistep + (1 − zi)Eiep.

- Proposition 3 (Routing optimality and detector-error regret). Assume that the episode-level and step-level teachers specialize according to the oracle criticality label:

zi⋆ = 1 =⇒ Eistep ≤ Eiep, zi⋆ = 0 =⇒ Eiep ≤ Eistep.

(16)

Then, pointwise,

Eiroute = min Eiep,Eistep

(17) Consequently, if

+ 1{ zi ̸= zi⋆} Eiep − Eistep .

Eiep − Eistep ≤ Γ (18) almost surely under i ∼ νb, then

[Eiep],Ei∼ν

b Eistep

b Eiroute ≤ min Ei∼ν

Under perfect criticality detection,

zi = zi⋆ almost surely, and therefore

Eiroute = min Eiep,Eistep pointwise, with

[Eiep],Ei∼ν

b Eistep .

Ei∼ν

b

Proof. Consider first the event zi = zi⋆. Under Eq. 16, the routing rule selects a teacher with the smaller approximation error. Hence

Eiroute = min Eiep,Eistep . The second term in Eq. 17 is zero on this event. On the event zi ̸= zi⋆, the routing rule selects the nonspecialized teacher. Its excess error over the oracle choice is exactly

Eiep − Eistep .

This proves Eq. 17. Taking expectations yields

min Eiep,Eistep

b Eiroute = Ei∼ν

1{ zi ̸= zi⋆} Eiep − Eistep . Using

and Eq. 18 proves Eq. 19. The perfect-detection statements follow by setting Pri∼ν

##### ( zi ̸= zi⋆) = 0.

| |
|---|

- Proposition 3 separates the two requirements behind critical-first routing: teacher specialization and criticality-detection accuracy. Under specialization, perfect detection recovers the oracle pointwise choice between the two candidate teachers. With imperfect detection, the excess teacherapproximation error is controlled jointly by the detector error probability and the difference between the two candidate teacher errors.

The criterion in Eq. 15 measures the quality of a candidate teacher relative to qi⋆. It is distinct from the student–teacher reverse-KL loss DKL(pθ,i∥qi) appearing in LRKL. Therefore, without additional assumptions relating the candidate teachers’ likelihood ratios, the routing result should not be interpreted as a direct upper bound on LRKL.

- A.5 SUMMARY

- Proposition 1 analyzes the unclipped skill component of the OPID policy loss:

Lunclipskill (θ) = −λskillEi∼ν

b a∼bi

[ρθ,i(a)∆i(a)].

Conditioned on fixed rollout histories, routed skills, and detached distributions bi and qi, this loss has the exact decomposition

Lunclipskill (θ) = λskill [LRKL(θ) − Db(θ)].

- Proposition 2 shows that collecting the ordinary autoregressive contexts on policy eliminates the outer context-distribution mismatch: when the collection distribution equals the behavior-policy distribution, dµ = db, the occupancy term in Eq. 12 is zero.
- Proposition 3 analyzes how the teacher qi is selected from episode-level and step-level candidates. Under the stated specialization assumption, critical-first routing recovers the lower-error candidate under perfect detection, while the degradation under imperfect detection is controlled by

( zi ̸= zi⋆). Taken together, the three results establish that:

Γ Pr

i∼νb

- 1. The unclipped OPID skill loss is an exact relative-KL loss and is first-order equivalent to scaled reverse-KL distillation at the behavior policy;
- 2. On-policy collection removes the mismatch in the outer distribution of ordinary autoregressive contexts; and
- 3. Critical-first routing approaches the oracle candidate-teacher selection when the candidate teachers specialize and the criticality detector is accurate.

- B ADDITIONAL EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS

This section provides the experimental protocol used for the results in the main paper. We organize the details by datasets, baselines and implementation.

- B.1 DATASETS

- Table 4 summarizes the datasets used in our experiments. The evaluation covers three agentic domains: embodied reasoning, web navigation, and search-augmented question answering.

ALFWorld. ALFWorld (Shridhar et al., 2020) aligns text-based interaction with the ALFRED household environment. Given a natural-language goal and textual observations, an agent must issue a sequence of admissible actions to complete the task. We report results on six task types: Pick, Look, Clean, Heat, Cool, and Pick2.

WebShop. WebShop (Yao et al., 2022) is a text-based e-commerce environment in which an agent searches for products, opens product pages, selects attributes, and purchases an item that satisfies a natural-language request. The environment provides both a normalized task-completion score, which assigns partial credit for matching requested attributes, and a binary success signal for exact task completion.

Search-Augmented QA. Following the Search-R1 setting (Jin et al., 2025), we evaluate searchaugmented reasoning on Natural Questions (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019), TriviaQA (Joshi et al., 2017), PopQA (Mallen et al., 2023), HotpotQA (Yang et al., 2018), 2WikiMultiHopQA (Ho et al., 2020), MuSiQue (Trivedi et al., 2022), and Bamboogle (Press et al., 2023). In this setting, the agent interacts with the configured search environment before producing a final answer.

Training Data. For training, we conduct separate training for each benchmark setting. Specifically, we sample 2,400 training examples from ALFWorld, 2,400 training examples from WebShop, and 19,200 training examples from the search-augmented QA benchmarks.

- B.2 BASELINES

We compare OPID with prompting-only methods, outcome-based reinforcement learning, and selfdistillation or skill-distillation variants. Unless explicitly marked with an asterisk, every method is evaluated from the ordinary environment interaction history, without access to skills or any other privileged context. An asterisk therefore denotes validation/test-time access to a natural-language skill; it does not indicate a different backbone or evaluation task.

#### Prompting-only methods.

- • Vanilla. This is the original instruction-tuned backbone used without any post-training. The model receives only the standard environment prompt and the interaction history exposed by the environment interface.
- • Skill-Prompt∗. This method keeps the Vanilla parameters frozen but augments the validation/test context with a retrieved natural-language skill relevant to the current task. Because no gradient update is performed, any improvement comes purely from in-context use of the skill.

#### Outcome-based reinforcement learning.

- • GRPO (Shao et al., 2024). Group Relative Policy Optimization is a critic-free policygradient method that samples a group of trajectories for each task, assigns each trajectory a scalar outcome reward, and normalizes these rewards within the group to construct relative advantages. In the outcome-only setting used here, every generated token in a trajectory inherits the same sequence-level advantage, and the policy is updated with a clipped importance-ratio objective; no process labels or teacher-derived token-level targets are used.
- • Skill-GRPO. This variant uses the same group-relative outcome objective as GRPO, but makes a task-relevant natural-language skill available to the policy during training rollouts and policy updates. The skill can therefore shape exploration and the trajectories that receive reinforcement. The skill is removed at validation/test time, so this baseline tests whether skill-guided behavior has been absorbed into the model parameters rather than merely followed from the prompt.

- • Skill-GRPO∗. This method is trained in the same way as Skill-GRPO, but retains the skill context at validation/test time. Its train-time and test-time conditioning are consequently matched.

#### Self-distillation and skill-distillation methods.

- • OPSD (Zhao et al., 2026). On-Policy Self-Distillation instantiates a student and a teacher from the same underlying model but gives them different conditioning contexts. The student samples trajectories on-policy from the ordinary task context, whereas the teacher additionally receives training-only privileged information, such as a verified solution or an equivalent auxiliary context. For every prefix of the student’s own trajectory, the teacher re-scores the next-token distribution and provides a dense token-level target through fullvocabulary or sampled-token distribution matching. Gradients are applied to the student side while the teacher distribution is treated as a stop-gradient target, and the privileged teacher context is absent at inference time.
- • GRPO+OPSD. This is a direct multi-objective combination of the sequence-level GRPO loss and the token-level OPSD loss. The outcome term reinforces or penalizes complete trajectories according to environment feedback, while the distillation term supplies local guidance at individual token positions. The two losses are simply combined, making this baseline a controlled test of whether naively adding dense self-distillation to outcome-based RL is sufficient.
- • Skill-SD (Wang et al., 2026). This method adapts self-distillation to multi-turn agent tasks. Completed trajectories are summarized into compact natural-language skills that record successful behaviors, common failure modes, and reusable high-level workflows. During training, a retrieved skill conditions only the teacher branch, while the student continues to generate on-policy trajectories from the plain task prompt; the student must therefore internalize the teacher-side guidance rather than rely on the skill at test time.
- • RLSD (Yang et al., 2026). RLSD uses a privileged self-teacher for fine-grained credit assignment without directly optimizing a teacher–student distribution-matching loss. It converts the token-wise teacher–student log-probability gap into a bounded weight that modulates the magnitude of each token’s GRPO update, while the sign and direction of the update remain anchored to the environment-derived outcome advantage. Thus, privileged information can indicate where a larger or smaller update is useful, but it does not decide whether a sampled token should be reinforced or penalized. In the original formulation, the self-distillation contribution is strongest early in training and is scheduled to decay toward vanilla GRPO, combining early dense guidance with a stable outcome-optimized training phase.
- • SDAR (Lu et al., 2026a). It keeps verifier-driven GRPO as the primary optimization backbone and adds a separately gated self-distillation objective for multi-turn agents. A teacher branch receives training-only privileged context, such as a retrieved skill, and re-scores the student’s on-policy tokens; a smooth, bounded token-level gate then controls how strongly each teacher signal enters the auxiliary loss. The gate can use student uncertainty and/or the detached teacher–student log-probability gap, giving greater weight to positive teacher endorsements while softly attenuating potentially unreliable negative rejections. Unlike RLSD, SDAR leaves the GRPO advantage itself unchanged and regulates the auxiliary distillation loss instead; the student is evaluated without privileged skill context.

For all reproduced post-training baselines, we use the same backbone and environment wrappers as OPID and match the rollout budget, task batch, number of training steps, and evaluation protocol whenever applicable. The intended differences are restricted to the optimization signal and to the explicitly stated availability of skills or other privileged training context.

By default, we use GLM-5.2 (Z.ai, 2026) as the analyzer, with temperature set to 0.4 and maximum output length set to 4096. We limit the max number of identified critical steps at 5 for ALFWorld and WebShop, and at 2 for Search-based QA.

- C SUPPLEMENTARY RESULTS

- C.1 DETAILED SAMPLE EFFICIENCY COMPARISON

- Table 7 reports the ALFWorld success rate when only a fraction of the training data is used. OPID consistently improves over GRPO across all data budgets. The gains are especially large in the low- and mid-data regimes, reaching +15.6 points with 60% of the data and +20.3 points with 80% of the data. These results suggest that trajectory-derived hindsight skills allow OPID to extract more supervision from each rollout, making outcome-based RL less dependent on large numbers of environment interactions.

- Table 7: Sample efficiency comparison on ALFWorld. We report success rates under different fractions of the training data. The ∆ row shows the absolute improvement of OPID over GRPO, indicating that OPID provides stronger gains especially in low- and mid-data regimes.

C.2 CROSS-DOMAIN GENERALIZATION

- Table 8 evaluates transfer to the ALFWorld unseen split. OPID improves the average success rate over GRPO by +7.7 points, with particularly clear gains on Look and Heat. This indicates that OPID does not merely fit the observed training trajectories. Instead, the distilled episode-level workflows and step-level decision rules retain value under unseen environment configurations.

- Table 8: Cross-domain generalization results on ALFWorld Unseen. We report success rates across six unseen task types and their average. OPID improves the average success rate over GRPO, indicating that trajectory-derived skill supervision transfers beyond the training environments.

Training step

- Figure 7: Average critical steps per sequence on ALFWorld. The curve reports how many timesteps are selected by the analyzer for step-level hindsight skills in each trajectory. The relatively small number of critical steps indicates that OPID applies local skill supervision selectively, while relying on episode-level skills as default guidance for non-critical decisions.

- C.3 TRAINING DIAGNOSTICS AND SKILL EXTRACTION PATTERNS

Figures 7–9 provide additional diagnostics for the OPID training pipeline. Figure 7 reports the average number of critical steps identified on ALFWorld, illustrating that OPID applies step-level supervision sparsely rather than assigning local skills to every decision. Figure 8 further visualizes the training advantage dynamics, complementing the main-paper training curves and showing how OPID reshapes the learning signal during policy optimization. Figure 9 shows the analyzer prompt used to convert completed trajectories into hierarchical skills.

- D CASE STUDY

Figures 10–15 provide illustrative examples from the ALFWorld, Search-QA, and WebShop benchmarks.

- E ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION

OPID studies how completed on-policy trajectories can be reused as hindsight supervision for longhorizon agentic reinforcement learning. A natural next step is to evaluate this idea in broader interactive environments where agents must discover latent rules, maintain long-term state, and adapt through extended interaction. Benchmarks such as OdysseyArena (Xu et al., 2026), AgentBench (Liu et al., 2023), WebArena (Zhou et al., 2023), Mind2Web (Deng et al., 2023), and VisualWebArena (Koh et al., 2024) provide complementary stress tests beyond the embodied, shopping, and search-based settings considered in this paper. These environments would test whether trajectory-derived hindsight skills remain useful when the agent must handle longer horizons, richer interfaces, and more open-ended forms of exploration.

Another direction is to enrich the structure of hindsight skills. OPID currently extracts episode-level and step-level skills from completed trajectories and routes them according to decision criticality. Future work could combine this on-policy extraction with higher-level reasoning abstractions, such as search-discovered reasoning patterns or reusable thought structures (Wu et al., 2024), and with policy-aware exploration mechanisms developed for long-horizon agent learning (Wu et al., 2026a;

- Figure 8: Magnitudes of episode-level and skill-guided advantage signals during OPID training. Episode abs advantage measures the mean absolute advantage from group-relative outcome rewards, while skill abs advantage measures the mean absolute advantage induced by skill-guided log-probability shifts. The comparison shows how OPID combines sparse trajectory-level feedback with dense skill-conditioned supervision throughout optimization.

Lu et al., 2026a). Such extensions may allow agents to aggregate skills across trajectories, identify recurring failure modes, and form more compositional behavioral rules while preserving OPID’s key design choice: skills are used to shape training, not retrieved as privileged context at inference time.

Finally, OPID opens several deployment-oriented directions. Since the analyzer and skillconditioned scoring are used only during training, the learned policy incurs no additional inferencetime skill retrieval cost. Nevertheless, the training pipeline can still benefit from more efficient inference and scoring mechanisms. Speculative and retrieval-parallel decoding methods such as DOUBLE (Shen et al., 2026) may reduce the cost of repeated model scoring during skill-conditioned distillation. In parallel, extending OPID to more perceptual and embodied settings, including active embodied intelligence benchmarks such as RobotEQ (Fang et al., 2026), could test whether hindsight skill supervision helps agents acquire not only task completion strategies, but also socially and spatially grounded decision rules.

### Analyser Prompt

Analyze the following agent episode and return ONLY valid JSON. You need to complete all three fields:

- 1. Write a concise episode_summary.
- 2. Write one episode_skill that extracts the successful trajectory into workflow: the core decision rule and action ordering that made this trajectory work. / Write one episode_skill that extracts the failed trajectory into avoidance rules: the core mistake and warning signs that agent should avoid.
- 3. Provide concise, action-oriented decision guidance for at most {max_skill_count} critical step(s) from the candidate set as entries in step_skills; use the full episode to infer the guidance, but phrase each skill as advice the policy can act on at that step. Important constraints:

- - Step indexing is 0-based: step 0 is the first step of the trajectory.
- - Use the task description together with the episode context to judge progress and mistakes.
- - Use the full episode context to identify what each critical step should have done better.
- - Each step_skills value should be one short imperative sentence for the policy at that step.
- - Write step_skills as policy-facing guidance, not as retrospective explanation of the trajectory.
- - Return only these top-level fields: episode_summary, episode_skill, step_skills.
- - The chosen steps are exactly the keys present in step_skills.

Return format: {

"episode_summary": "string", "episode_skill": "string", "step_skills": {
