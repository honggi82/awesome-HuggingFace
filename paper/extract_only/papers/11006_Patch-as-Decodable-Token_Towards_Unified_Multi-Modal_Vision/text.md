ABSTRACT

Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced rapidly in recent years. However, existing approaches for vision tasks often rely on indirect representations, such as generating coordinates as text for detection, which limits performance and prevents dense prediction tasks like segmentation. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Patch-as-Decodable Token (PaDT), a unified paradigm that enables MLLMs to directly generate both textual and diverse visual outputs. Central to PaDT are Visual Reference Tokens (VRTs), derived from visual patch embeddings of query images and interleaved seamlessly with LLM’s output textual tokens. A lightweight decoder then transforms LLM’s outputs into detection, segmentation, and grounding predictions. Unlike prior methods, PaDT processes VRTs independently at each forward pass and dynamically expands the embedding table, thus improving localization and differentiation among similar objects. We further tailor a training strategy for PaDT by randomly selecting VRTs for supervised fine-tuning and introducing a robust per-token crossentropy loss. Our empirical studies across four visual perception and understanding tasks suggest PaDT consistently achieving state-of-the-art performance, even compared with significantly larger MLLM models. The code is available at https://github.com/Gorilla-Lab-SCUT/PaDT.

1 INTRODUCTION

Fine-grained image perception and understanding, which aim to associate specific image regions with contextual information, such as semantic or instance, is a fundamental task in computer vision and serves as a cornerstone for numerous applications. Classical vision models (Ren et al., 2015; Redmon et al., 2016; Carion et al., 2020) remain state-of-the-art for pure detection and segmentation tasks, but they lack flexible language interaction and understanding, thus prohibiting open vocabulary oriented visual reasoning tasks. At an earlier stage, inspired by CLIP (Radford et al., 2021), many vision-language detectors such as GLIP (Li et al., 2022b) and Grounding DINO (Ren et al., 2023) incorporate language information to detect arbitrary classes. However, these methods remain vision-centric backbones augmented with language, and thus struggle to handle more complex textual descriptions and are limited to structured output.

Recent advances have led to powerful multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) (Alayrac et al., 2022; Li et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2024c; Bai et al., 2025; Zhu et al., 2025) that couple vision encoders with Large Language Models(LLMs). Pretrained on massive multimodal datasets, these models

encode rich prior knowledge and provide a strong foundation for visual perception and understanding, as illustrated in Fig. 1. To conform with the textual output space of LLMs, most existing MLLMs (Liu et al., 2025a; Bai et al., 2025; Zhu et al., 2025) serialize detected regions into bounding box coordinates, expressed in textual form, such as [x1,y1,x2,y2]. While straightforward, this strategy introduces several challenges. First, output formats are often inconsistent across samples even under the same prompt, as illustrated in Fig. 2(a), thereby increasing the difficulty of parsing and structured output. Second, numerical coordinate representations provide precise spatial descriptions but lack semantic alignment between textual and visual modalities, as shown in Fig. 2(b). This inherent misalignment can lead to repetition or hallucination between coordinate and actual visual targets (Jiang et al., 2024b). Moreover, since numerical coordinate representations are mapped into discrete textual tokens, a single coordinate value may be split into several unrelated tokens, as shown in Fig. 2(b). These discontinuous coordinate tokens can hinder prediction accuracy, e.g., fragmented numbers.

In this work, we introduce a unified paradigm, Patch-as-Decodable Token (PaDT), which enables MLLMs to directly generate both textual and diverse visual targets in a unified yet flexible way. For this purpose, we propose the Visual Reference Tokens (VRTs), which can be seamlessly interleaved with LLM’s output textual tokens. VRTs are generated by the proposed Dynamic Embedding Module, adapted directly from the original visual patch embeddings. In this way, they occur in a feature space consistent with the original LLM, while each VRT explicitly corresponds to a specific image patch within the query image. Thus, VRTs can be naturally interpreted within the LLM’s feature space, allowing detected objects to be represented by multiple VRTs in a fine-grained manner. Based on this design, PaDT owns the inherent ability to predict diverse visual outputs, e.g. semantic masks and bounding boxes. Specifically, MLLMs only need to predict a subset of VRTs, which are then decoded into the final structured visual outputs by a lightweight decoder. A prior art (Ma et al., 2025) attempted to empower LLMs to output image patch tokens, discretized by a global codebook, to represent the target within the image. However, this approach remains limited in flexibility and generality due to maintaining a global codebook. First, there is a risk of predicting visual tokens that do not appear in the query image. Moreover, the decoded visual token does not have unique correspondence in the query image, thus risking misalignment between predicted visual tokens and query image tokens, e.g. confusion between similar objects in the image. In contrast, PaDT processes VRTs independently at each forward pass, making it more efficient. By maintaining a high-level feature space aligned with that of LLMs and preserving unique positional information for each image region, PaDT ensures coherent predictions as illustrated Fig. 2(c). Moreover, as shown in Fig. 2(d), VRT predictions over objects exhibit great spatial continuity.

To enable PaDT to achieve strong performance, we design an effective fine-tuning strategy and propose a robust per-token cross-entropy loss tailored for the proposed visual reference token, which stabilizes training and mitigates overfitting. Notably, our 3B model surpasses the previous state-ofthe-art by 19.0 mAP on COCO detection and achieves an average accuracy of 93.6 on the referring expression comprehension (REC) task, outperforming the much larger 78B InternVL3 model.

The main contributions of this work can be summarized as follows:

- • We introduce a unified paradigm, Patch-as-Decodable Token (PaDT), which enables MLLMs to directly generate both textual and diverse visual targets in a unified yet flexible way. With the proposed Visual Reference Token (VRT), our method achieves superior performance across diverse fine-grained image perception and understanding
- • We propose a lightweight yet robust VRT-based decoder, termed the PaDT Decoder. Given the generated VRTs, it can uniformly decode diverse fine-grained structured visual outputs, such as segmentation masks and bounding boxes.
- • We propose an effective fine-tuning strategy together with a robust per-token cross-entropy loss. PaDT achieves the state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of visual perception and understanding tasks. The effectiveness is validated beyond perception tasks but also a customized image captioning task.

Multimodal Large Language Models. With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) have emerged as powerful systems for vision-language reasoning (Li et al., 2022a; Alayrac et al., 2022; Achiam et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023; Zhu et al., 2023; Bai et al., 2025; Ye et al., 2023). Early milestones such as CLIP (Radford et al., 2021) and ALIGN (Jia et al., 2021) demonstrated the effectiveness of large-scale contrastive pretraining for joint vision-text representations. BLIP-2 (Li et al., 2022a) further improved alignment through the Q-former design. More recently, instruction-tuned MLLMs including LLaVA (Liu et al., 2023) and MiniGPT-4 (Zhu et al., 2023) leverage multimodal instruction data, yielding strong performance in open-ended visual question answering and reasoning. Building on these foundations, subsequent works extend capabilities to higher-resolution image understanding (e.g., LLaVA-Next (Liu

- et al., 2024c), LLaVA-UHD (Guo et al., 2024)), diverse instruction sets (Ye et al., 2023), multiimage (Jiang et al., 2024a; Li et al., 2024) and video inputs (Lin et al., 2023a; Chen et al., 2024a), as well as new pretraining objectives and architectural designs (Fang et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023b). Collectively, these advances establish MLLMs as versatile general-purpose models for multimodal reasoning.

MLLMs for Visual Perception & Understanding. Despite their broad capabilities, generalpurpose MLLMs remain limited in fine-grained perception tasks. This stems largely from vision encoders’ reliance on fixed patch grids (Dehghani et al., 2023; Fang et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023b), which often blur local details and impair tasks such as object localization, counting, or OCR. To mitigate this, adaptive tiling strategies, such as NaViT-style patch dropping and AnyRes (Luo et al.,

2023; Chen et al., 2024b; Liu et al., 2024a), allow flexible handling of variable-resolution image tiles, leading to improved spatial resolution. Another line of work explores reinforcement learning to enhance perception and reasoning, exemplified by VLM-R1 (Shen et al., 2025), Visual-RFT (Liu et al., 2025b), VisRL (Chen et al., 2025), and Seg-R1 (You & Wu, 2025). These approaches achieve better generalization and emergent capabilities such as segmentation and grounding. Prior works have primarily relied on reinforcement learning (Chen et al., 2025) or instruction tuning (Jiang et al.,

- 2024b) to strengthen visual reasoning, yet the potential of leveraging learned queries as anchors for visual perception remains underexplored. Moreover, designing a unified architecture that seamlessly accommodates diverse vision tasks continues to be an open challenge.

Unified Visual Tokenization. A complementary research direction focuses on unifying visual and linguistic representations through multi-granular tokenization. At the region level, methods convert object boxes or masks into geometric tokens (Chen et al., 2023b; Xuan et al., 2024; Peng et al., 2023; You et al., 2023) or learnable proxies (Zhang et al., 2024a; Yuan et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2023a; Rasheed et al., 2024), often grounded by detectors or SAM (Kirillov et al., 2023), thereby enabling more precise vision-language grounding. At the patch level, models such as the Emu series (Sun et al., 2023) and LaVIT (Jin et al., 2024) treat CLIP-derived patch features as visual vocabularies for denser alignment. Recent works further introduce autoregressive quantization of image patches (Team, 2024; Sun et al., 2024), discretizing pixels into “visual sentences” to support efficient cross-modal modeling, with even finer-grained tokenization explored in (Ma et al.,

- 2025). While these approaches approximate linguistic structures via region, instance, or pixel tokens, deeper semantic integration between vision and language is still limited. To address this, we propose a dynamic multimodal token space that enables close correspondence between language tokens and visual patches under a unified autoregressive modeling paradigm.

- 3 METHODOLOGY

- 3.1 REVISITING MULTIMODAL LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS

A Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) augments a Large Language Model (LLM) with a visual encoder, enabling it to perform not only general-purpose reasoning but also visual perception (Alayrac et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2024c; Bai et al., 2025). Given an image I ∈ H×W×3 and a text sequence T = (t1,...,tm), the MLLM autoregressively generates an output sequence

- Y = (y1,...,yt). An image encoder fv, typically a Vision Transformer (ViT) (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020), partitions I into N non-overlapping patches {Pn}Nn=1, which are subsequently encoded

into embeddings Fv = fv(I) ∈ N×d

v. A projector fp then aligns dimensions and downsamples, yielding Fpatch = fp(Fv) ∈ N

′×d. For instance, Qwen2.5-VL adopts nearest-neighbor

patch merging in the 2D patch space, resulting in N′ = 41N. The image embeddings are then fused with the text embeddings Etext(T) ∈ m×d to form a hybrid textual-visual representation

#### Z = [Fpatch;Etext(T)]. Here, Etext ∈ V

text×d denotes the text embedding table that maps each text token to its corresponding feature vector. The resulting multimodal representation Z is subsequently fed into a transformer-based LLM (Alayrac et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2024c; Bai et al., 2025). At timestep t, the hidden state ht produces the next-token distribution:

#### p(yt|I,T,y<t) = softmax(Wtext · ht), (1) with Wtext ∈ V

text×d denoting classifier weights.

Limitations of Text-based Vision Prediction. Current MLLMs are restricted to accepting textual–visual representations as input and producing only textual outputs, owing to their compatibility with the underlying LLM architecture. This limitation is suboptimal for structured vision tasks such as object detection and image segmentation. Specifically, current MLLMs (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL (Bai

- et al., 2025), InternVL3 (Zhu et al., 2025)) serialize visual targets into strings at output side. This leads to two major issues. First, outputs vary in format (absolute vs. normalized coordinates, JSONstyle vs. free-form), complicating parsing and structured output, as shown in Fig. 2(a). Second, numerical coordinate representations are mapped into discrete textual tokens which are generated digit by digit (e.g., “489” → “4, 8, 9”). This disrupts numerical continuity and may hinder prediction accuracy (Fig. 2(b)). More importantly, while this numerical representation effectively describes spatial information precisely, it lacks semantic information, which is crucial for image understanding tasks. This inherent mismatch, revealed through token activation analyses (Li et al., 2025) as illustrated in Fig. 2(b), can lead to errors such as repetition or hallucination in dense prediction tasks (Jiang et al., 2024b).

- 3.2 VISUAL REFERENCE TOKEN

We propose the Patch-as-Decodable-Token (PaDT) framework, which introduces Visual Reference Tokens (VRTs), a unified tokenization scheme that embeds visual patches directly as decodable tokens within the autoregressive generation process. PaDT extends conventional MLLMs with three key components: (1) Dynamic Embedding Module augments the textual vocabulary codebook with visual patches, specific VRTs, at each forward pass, yielding a multi-modal codebook. (2) With this multi-modal codebook and the proposed PaDT Head, VRTs become both embeddable at the input side and decodable at the output side, resulting in a unified and natural format. (3) A lightweight PaDT Decoder is proposed to convert variable VRTs into diverse visual representations, such as bounding boxes and masks, enabling downstream tasks including detection, segmentation, and grounding. This further enhances both the robustness and flexibility of the proposed method.

- 3.2.1 UNIFIED MULTI-MODAL FORMAT WITH VRTS

A core challenge is to ensure that VRTs can by interpretable by LLMs, being both embeddable in the input space and decodable in the output space. Prior work, e.g., ClawMachine (Ma et al., 2025) relies on pretrained discrete visual tokenizers (Jin et al., 2024). It inserts the entire codebook, which contains a massive number of tokens, into the LLM embedding table and forces the LLM to map its high-level semantic feature space to tokens representing low-level image patches. Thus, this method is limited by (i) a fixed dataset-level codebook expansion which contains massive tokens that ignore patch-specific cues such as spatial location, and (ii) ambiguity arising from the lack of high-level semantics when visually similar patches from different objects maybe mapped to the same token.

Dynamic Multi-Modal Codebook Expansion. To avoid the above limitations, rather than introducing a standalone codebook, we reuse the extracted visual tokens from the input image, which already preserve rich semantic information. Since each visual token explicitly corresponds to an image patch, at each forward pass only the tokens from the current query image are dynamically expanded into the original textual codebook, instead of memorizing all possible visual patterns through a fixed codebook. Specifically, in the proposed Dynamic Embedding Module, original patch features Fpatch ∈ N

′×d are projected by a lightweight module fvp into visual reference prototypes Pref. fvp consists of a LayerNorm and a low-rank linear projection. These prototypes are then concate-

nated with text embeddings to form a dynamic embedding table as,

′×d. (2)

Edyn = [Etext;Pref], Pref = fvp(Fpatch) ∈ N

Unified Input and Output Format. With the above Multi-Modal Codebook, both textual and visual information can be input and output in a unified way. On the input side, query image tokens are indexed in the Multi-Modal Codebook and converted into the corresponding VRTs, which are then embedded into the textual input to the LLM. Since VRTs are adapted from the original image tokens, they share a feature space that is similar to the LLM’s representation space, which simplifies training compared to ClawMachine (Ma et al., 2025). On the output side, to enable the original textual classifier to output expanded indices, the PaDT Head is proposed to augment the classifier with Pref, yielding

text+N′)×d. (3)

This joint design allows VRTs to be embedded as inputs and decoded as outputs, enabling the model to insert patch-level references directly into the autoregressive sequence. Building on this, we propose a robust strategy that represents detected objects with several (but not all) VRTs placed on them, and then decodes fine-grained representations such as bounding boxes or masks through the lightweight PaDT Decoder introduced below. This strategy is shown to be more robust and effective in our experiments. Template examples for each vision task are provided in Appendix A.2.

Figure 4: Illustration for PaDT decoder.

Considering that only several VRTs on a detected object are predicted, a visual decoder is needed to convert these predicted VRTs into task-specific outputs. For this purpose, we introduce a lightweight vision task decoder, implemented as a stack of three two-way attention blocks (Fig. 4(b)). The decoder takes as input the hidden features of predicted VRTs from the final LLM layer. These features are grouped into object queries, where each group corresponds to a sequence of VRTs separated by intervening text tokens (Fig. 4(a)). To enable task-specific decoding, we inject three learnable tokens, bound-

ing box, mask, and score tokens, into each group of object queries. After passing through the three attention blocks, each task token is projected into its respective output space, producing bounding boxes, segmentation masks, and confidence scores.

- 3.2.3 TRAINING STRATEGY

Robust Per-token Cross-Entropy Loss. For the autoregressive output of the MLLM, we adopt the standard supervised fine-tuning paradigm with a per-token cross-entropy loss:

1 T t −log p(ˆyt | I,T,y<t) = −log softmaxGT(Wtv · ht), (4)

LCE =

where yˆt denotes the ground-truth token at step t, ht is the hidden state, and Wtv projects to the token vocabulary. Unlike prior work that uses all foreground visual tokens as supervision (Ma et al.,

2025), we propose to randomly sample Nvrt foreground tokens for each forward pass. This sampling strategy increases the diversity of supervision and prevents the model from overfitting to a fixed set of tokens, thereby improving generalization. To implement this, we introduce a foreground mask M ∈ {0,1}T×N

′

, where Mt,n = 1 indicates that token n at step t was not selected. For such tokens, we suppress their contribution to the loss by masking their logits:

lt′ = Wtv · ht, lt,n′ +V

#### = −∞ if Mt,n = 1. (5)

text

This effectively removes the masked tokens from the softmax normalization, ensuring they are neither rewarded nor penalized. The resulting robust cross-entropy loss is:

#### LrobustCE = −log softmaxGT(lt′). (6)

By combining random sampling with masked supervision, this objective improves robustness and encourages the model to explore diverse valid visual references during training.

Task-specific Losses. For structured outputs from vision task decoder, we adopt task-specific objectives i.e. Lbbox, Lmask and Lscore following (Kamath et al., 2021; Kirillov et al., 2023). More implemented details about the task-specific losses are given in Appendix A.4. The final training objective of PaDT is

L = LrobustCE + Lbbox + Lmask + Lscore. (7)

- 4 EXPERIMENT

Tasks and Datasets. We evaluate PaDT across a diverse set of visual perception & understanding tasks. Specifically, we consider: (i) referring expression comprehension and referring expression segmentation on RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, and RefCOCOg (Mao et al., 2016; Yu et al., 2016); (ii) open-vocabulary detection on COCO 2017 (Lin et al., 2014); and (iii) referring image captioning (RIC), for which we construct a new benchmark by re-annotating COCO with vision–language model (VLM) supervision. Further dataset details are provided in Appendix A.1.

Architecture and Training Details. We adopt Qwen2.5-VL (Bai et al., 2025) as the base model and conduct experiments with both 3B and 7B variants to evaluate scalability. Based on existing dataset annotations, at each training step we randomly sample Nvrt = 5 visual reference tokens from the foreground mask of each target to construct the ground-truth MLLM sequence. If segmentation masks are unavailable, VRTs are instead sampled within the bounding box. The ground-truth token templates are provided in Appendix A.2. Training is performed on a single node with eight 96GB GPUs, using a batch size of 16 per GPU. We set the learning rate to 2 × 10−5 and apply gradient checkpointing together with bfloat16 mixed precision for memory efficiency. FlashAttention2 (Dao, 2023) is further employed to accelerate attention computation.

Multi-Task Scalability. Joint training across tasks consistently improves performance, indicating strong cross-task generalization. To evaluate multi-task performance and analyze how performance scales with the number of tasks, we train PaDT jointly across all benchmarks, i.e., RefCOCO/+/g, COCO, and RIC, resulting in an enhanced multi-task variant denoted as PaDT Pro. Unlike taskspecific PaDT models, PaDT Pro can seamlessly switch between tasks by simply altering the prompt.

- 4.1 VISUAL PERCEPTION & UNDERSTANDING TASKS

Referring Expression Comprehension. The Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) task evaluates an MLLM’s ability to localize objects given natural language descriptions, where a prediction is considered correct if its IoU with the ground-truth box exceeds 50%. As shown in Tab. 1, PaDT and PaDT Pro achieve state-of-the-art performance at both 3B and 7B scales. In particular, PaDT Pro (3B) obtains 96.0/95.5/95.0 on RefCOCO, 91.8/94.8/88.4 on RefCOCO+, and 93.6/94.0 on RefCOCOg, surpassing all previous MLLM methods. The overall average of PaDT Pro (3B) reaches 93.6, which is further boosted to 94.5 with the 7B model. Remarkably, both PaDT and

PaDT Pro (3B) already outperform the much larger 78B InternVL3 model. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the visual reference token paradigm, which substantially aligns textual semantics with image patches and thereby improves the precision of object localization in MLLMs.

Referring Expression Segmentation. Similar to REC, the Referring Expression Segmentation (RES) task evaluates an MLLM’s ability to segment the target object mask given a natural language description. We adopt cIoU as the evaluation metric, and results are reported in Tab. 2. Both PaDT and PaDT Pro achieve the best performance compared with existing methods, even against approaches such as Seg-R1 and Text4Seg+SAM that leverage the powerful SAM segmentation model. With the lightweight PaDT decoder that translates unified visual reference tokens into segmentation masks, our models consistently outperform prior baselines. Additional qualitative examples are provided in Appendix A.6.

Open-vocabulary Detection. This is a fundamental visual perception task that evaluates an MLLM’s ability to perform semantic grounding. As shown in Table 3, most existing MLLMs struggle with this task, showing low precision and recall. For instance, Qwen2.5-VL (3B) achieves only 13.7 mAP, and InternVL3 (8B) reaches 17.5 mAP on the COCO2017 validation set. Our PaDT and PaDT Pro substantially advance the state of the art. PaDT Pro (3B) achieves 38.2 mAP, while the 7B variant further improves to 39.0 mAP, nearly doubling the performance of prior best methods. These gains highlight the effectiveness of visual reference tokens in strengthening semantic association and object localization.

Referring Image Captioning. To validate both the visual understanding and grounding ability, we conduct experiments on our RIC dataset. As shown in Table 4, PaDT and PaDT Pro (3B) deliver strong improvements, reaching 1.45 CIDEr, 0.304 Meteor, 0.501 ROUGE-L, 0.467 BLEU-4, and top detection scores of 82.3% GreedyPrecision (GP) and 45.1% GreddyRecall (GR). The 7B models further extend performance, with PaDT Pro (7B) maintaining competitive caption quality, i.e. 1.39 CIDEr, while achieving the best detection-oriented scores, i.e. 82.3% GP, 45.8% GR. These results suggest that PaDT generates not only fluent captions, but also semantically precise ones grounded in localized visual content.

- 4.2 ABLATION EXPERIMENTS

Ablation study of Proposed Components in PaDT. We conduct detailed ablation studies in Tab. 5 using the 3B model with the following observations. i) The first row without VRTs corresponds to supervised fine-tuning on Qwen2.5-VL, directly predicting bounding box coordinates. By inegrating VRTs with robust CE loss and random VRTs selection, we observe noticeable improvement

in REC (detection task) and RES (segmentation task) being enabled. ii) We further notice that both projection module fvp and robust CE loss are necessary for achieving improved performance. iii) Alternative choice of including all foreground VRTs during training may even harm the performance, probably due to bias towards high density regions.

Effectiveness of Mask Refinement with SAM2-L. We further analyze the compability of PaDT output with segmentation foundation model, SAM2-L under three schemes. i) Given the VRTs generated by PaDT, we extract their coordinates as point prompts to SAM2-L, denoted as point. ii) Using the bounding box and mask generated by PaDT, respectively, as prompt for SAM2-L. We explored different combinations with results in Tab. 6. First, we observe that using point prompt fails to improve upon PaDT, due to the sparse prior information. However, both box and mask prompts are conducive to further improving the results under the help of SAM. Combining multiple prompts yields more significant improvement. Visualizations in Fig. 5 corroborate these findings. The results suggest the segmentation performance can be further enhanced with expert foundation model at the expense of additional inference cost.

Effectiveness of Pretraining and Task-specific Finetuning. To evaluate the generalization and data-scaling properties of the PaDT framework, we pretrain on Objects365 (Shao et al., 2019) and subsequently finetune on the COCO dataset. As shown in Tab. 7, PaDT exhibits stronger zero-shot performance than the Qwen2.5-VL base model, and its finetuned version consistently outperforms direct training on task-specific data.

- 5 CONCLUSION

In this work, we proposed Patch-as-Decodable Token (PaDT), a unified paradigm that equips MLLMs with the ability to generate both textual and visual outputs through Visual Reference Tokens (VRTs). By dynamically embedding VRTs into the LLM output space, PaDT ensures semantically coherent and visually grounded predictions, overcoming the inefficiency and misalignment issues of prior codebook-based methods. A light-weight decoder and an effective training strategy are further introduced to enable visual perception and understanding tasks within PaDT. Extensive experiments across detection, segmentation, grounding, and captioning demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, highlighting directly predicting visual tokens as an effective and scalable paradigm toward general-purpose multimodal reasoning systems.

A APPENDIX

- A.1 REFERRING IMAGE CAPTIONING (RIC) DATASET A.1.1 DATASET CONSTRUCTION

Image captioning is a fundamental benchmark for evaluating the vision understanding ability of MLLMs. In the conventional setting, given an input image, the model generates a pure textual description that summarizes the main subject and its activity, trained on large-scale image–text pairs. However, such descriptions provide little supervision regarding object-level grounding, making it difficult to assess whether the model accurately captures the spatial locations of entities. To address this limitation, we re-annotate the COCO2017 dataset with more fine-grained annotations and propose our Referring Image Captioning (RIC) dataset. Specifically, we leverage Qwen2.5-VL-72B (prompt provided below) and feed each image together with its box-level annotations, instructing the model to produce enriched captions that explicitly reference the corresponding box IDs. Examples of the resulting training samples are shown in Fig. 6.

Prompt for generating RIC dataset

Prompt: <image>Please describe the image, focusing on the main objects (instances) present. After mentioning an object in the caption, immediately append its instance ID(s) in parentheses, using the format (<box id: ID/>). You MUST ONLY use the instance IDs provided in the list below. Do NOT invent or make up any IDs. If there are multiple instance IDs for the same object, list all IDs within the same parentheses, separated by commas. For example: ’A man (<box id: ID/>) is standing by the table (<box id: ID/>). Two ovens (<box id: ID/>, <box id: ID/>) are visible.’ Here are the optional instances in the image (id: ID, format: category: name, bbox: [x1, y1, x2, y2]):

- - 200887, person, [389, 70, 498, 348]
- - {list all annotations within this query image.}

IMPORTANT: Only use the instance IDs listed above in your caption. Do NOT invent or make up any new IDs. Generate a fluent English caption that includes the main objects and their instance IDs as specified.You don’t have to include all instances from the list above, as they are optional; only describe the main elements of the image. The caption should be no more than 100 words and should not contain any information irrelevant to the image.

Qwen2.5-VL-72B: (Example) A bustling kitchen scene features a person (<box id: 200887/>) working near a sink (<box id: 2196309/>). The dining table (<box id: 119568/>) holds various cooking items, including a bowl (<box id: 713388/>) and a bottle (<box id: 82445/>). Two ovens (<box id: 1125079/>, <box id: 2139366/>) are visible in the background. Another person (<box id: 1218137/>) appears partially on the left. The table also has a cup (<box id: 1883614/>) and a knife (<box id: 693231/>). The kitchen is equipped with hanging pots and a well-used workspace, emphasizing a busy cooking environment.

- A.2 TEMPLATE EXAMPLE FOR EACH VISION TASK

Here we present the interaction templates used in our PaDT framework, covering open-vocabulary detection, referring expression comprehension, and referring image captioning tasks. The prompts are designed to be concise and efficient, allowing PaDT to naturally interleave textual tokens and VRT predictions during task training.

Open Vocabulary Detection Task USER: <image>Please carefully check the image and detect the following objects: [{target list}]. ASSISTANT: In this image, there are {number} “{category}” (<VRT 0><VRT 1><VRT 2> <VRT 3><VRT 4>, <VRT 5><VRT 6><VRT 7><VRT 8><VRT 9>, ...) and ...

Referring Expression Comprehension / Segmentation Task USER: <image>Please carefully check the image and detect the object this sentence describes: “{question}”. ASSISTANT: The “{question}” refers to <VRT 0><VRT 1><VRT 2><VRT 3><VRT 4> in this image.

[Figure 221]

A man (<0>) rides a motorcycle (<1>) on a dirt path. He is wearing a red shirt, black shorts, and a helmet. The motorcycle has a rugged design with a rear storage box. The background features lush greenery, a large mountain partially covered in mist, and a bridge spanning the scene. Another person (<2>) and a bicycle (<3>) are visible in the distance, adding to the rural setting. The atmosphere is serene, with natural elements dominating the landscape.

[Figure 222]

[Figure 223]

A man (<0>) is riding a bicycle

A woman (<0>) stands in a kitchen, holding a cat (<1>). She is near a sink (<2>) with a bowl of oranges (<3>) and a bottle (<4>). A refrigerator (<5>) is visible to her right. A handbag

- (<1>) on a path near a train
- (<2>). The train, with a red and white design, is positioned on the tracks behind the cyclist. A stop sign (<3>) is visible to the right of the man, and overhead electrical lines run above the train. The scene is set in a well-lit area with some greenery along the path. The overall atmosphere suggests a calm, possibly suburban environment.

- (<6>) rests on the floor by her feet. The kitchen features wooden cabinets and a stove with a pan
- (<7>). A potted plant (<8>) and a clock (<9>) adorn the counter. The scene is warm and homey.

[Figure 224]

A young girl (<0>) is eagerly eating from a bowl (<1>) on a dining table (<2>). She uses a spoon (<3>) to scoop food, which appears to be melting. The table is covered with a red-checkered tablecloth. In the background, an adult (<4>) sits with arms crossed, and a wine glass (<5>) is partially visible. The scene is illuminated by natural light, creating a warm and casual dining atmosphere.

[Figure 225]

A woman (<0>) is eating from a spoon (<1>) in a kitchen. She holds a plate of food, including what appears to be broccoli. Behind her, there is an oven (<2>) and a microwave (<3>). A bottle (<4>) is visible on the counter near the oven. The setting is a home kitchen with light-colored cabinets and a tiled backsplash. The woman is wearing glasses and a blue top.

- Figure 6: The training samples of RIC dataset. For each image, there are 3-5 captions, in which we ask the MLLMs to refer to the object (via bounding box or visual reference tokens) following each object’s subject.

Referring Image Captioning Task USER: <image>Please describe this image. ASSISTANT: ... {object1} (<VRT 0><VRT 1><VRT 2><VRT 3><VRT 4>) ... {object2} (<VRT 5><VRT 6><VRT 7><VRT 8><VRT 9>) ...

- A.3 PROMPT USED FOR COMPETING METHODS

To guide MLLMs (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL (Bai et al., 2025), InternVL3 (Zhu et al., 2025), and the LLaVA series (Liu et al., 2024c)) in predicting bounding box coordinates in each task, we append a boxspecific and format-specific instruction to the task prompt, as detailed below.

Open Vocabulary Detection Task (with box and format instruction) USER: <image>Please carefully check the image and detect the following objects: [{target list}]. Output each detected target’s bbox coordinates in JSON format. For example, “‘json [{”bbox 2d”: [x1, y1, x2, y2], ”label”: ”target name”}] “‘. If no targets are detected in the image, simply respond with None.

Referring Expression Comprehension / Segmentation Task (with format instruction) USER: <image>Please carefully check the image and detect the object this sentence describes: “{question}”. Output the final answer in JSON format.

Referring Image Captioning Task (with box instruction)

USER: <image>Please describe this image. You should include the corresponding bounding box of the objects within the sentence. For example, ”In this image, a cat ([x1, y1, x2, y2]) is sitting on the wooden table ([x1, y1, x2, y2]), ...”.

- A.4 THE FORMULA OF THE TASK-SPECIFIC LOSSES ON THE PADT DECODER OUTPUT

Let Bpred ∈ L×4 denote predicted bounding boxes with ground truth Bgt, Mpred ∈ L×H×W predicted masks with ground truth Mgt, and Spred ∈ L×1 predicted confidence scores with ground truth Sgt. The Lbbox, Lmask and Lscore objectives are:

Lbbox =

Lmask =

- A.5 ADDITIONAL ABLATION STUDY

- A.5.1 TOKEN ACTIVATION MAP ANALYSIS

We provide additional Token Activation Map (TAM) visualizations, as illustrated in Fig. 7, comparing Qwen2.5-VL and the PaDT Pro 7B model, showing that visual reference tokens establish much stronger associations with target image patches than digit-by-digit coordinate predictions. These results further highlight the robust semantic alignment and precise object localization achieved by visual reference tokens.

- A.5.2 ABLATION STUDY OF OTHER USED LOSSES

As shown in Table 8, we conduct ablations on the loss components Lbbox, Lmask, and Lscore. PaDT achieves the best average performance when all visual task losses are combined. In particular,

removing the dynamic embedding module or omitting any individual loss (Lmask,Lbbox,Lscore) consistently degrades performance on both referring expression comprehension and segmentation. Notably, using all components yields the highest accuracy (93.2% REC and 76.1 mask cIoU) and the strongest multi-task ability, underscoring that each module and loss is essential and complementary for optimal task performance.

- A.5.3 ABLATION STUDY OF THE NUMBER OF SELECTED VRTS PER TARGET

We analyze how the number of selected visual patches per target impacts performance. As shown in Table 9, increasing the number of patches from 1 to 5 steadily improves both bounding box accuracy and mask cIoU across all datasets. The best results are obtained with 5 patches per target, while further increasing to 8 patches yields diminishing or even negative returns. This indicates that a moderate number of representative patches provides richer representations, whereas excessive patches introduce noise and redundancy, leading to unstable training of PaDT.

We also investigate the case of using all foreground patches as ground-truth VRTs during training.

- As shown in Fig. 8, this configuration produces the worst results. Although the number of output VRTs increases, the PaDT decoder exhibits clear performance degradation. We attribute this to the redundancy (that makes the PaDT hard to predict all VRTs at the inference stage) and low resolution of patch-level features: when all foreground patches are used, the decoder is forced to decode trivial and overlapping regions, which prevents it from learning accurate target boundaries and masks, especially when only a limited number of VRTs are predicted at inference. Consequently, selecting a moderate number of informative patches proves more effective than training with all foreground patches.

- A.6 QUALITATIVE EVALUATION

- A.6.1 OPEN VOCABULARY DETECTION ON COCO2017 DATASET

Comparison with representative MLLMs. In this section, we present qualitative results for openvocabulary detection on the COCO2017 dataset, comparing PaDT against representative MLLMs. As shown in Fig. 9, several key observations can be made.

- • Higher recall. PaDT consistently detects a larger number of objects in the scene, demonstrating stronger recall. This improvement stems from its ability to directly predict visual reference tokens (VRTs) that are anchored to image patches, enabling more reliable coverage of relevant objects.
- • Robustness in cluttered scenes. Competing MLLMs, which predict serialized bounding box coordinates, often struggle in scenes with many repetitive or similar-looking objects. Their predictions may miss valid instances or collapse onto a few candidates, whereas PaDT maintains distinct references to multiple targets.
- • Avoiding invalid outputs. Existing MLLMs occasionally fail to produce valid detections, labeled as “Error” in Fig. 9. In such cases, the models tend to generate repetitive text sequences until reaching the maximum output length, i.e. 2048 tokens. PaDT avoids this failure mode by grounding predictions directly in visual tokens rather than relying solely on text-based serialization.

Overall, these qualitative comparisons reinforce the advantages of PaDT: directly predicting visual tokens not only improves recall but also enhances robustness and stability in open-vocabulary detection.

Visualization of PaDT results on REC/RES and OVD tasks. In Fig. 10, we present extensive qualitative examples generated by the proposed PaDT framework. For Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) and Referring Expression Segmentation (RES), PaDT first parses the user query and identifies the corresponding target within the image. As illustrated in the top-left subfigure of each example, PaDT generates five visual reference tokens (VRTs), each directly correlated with specific image patches and thus easily localizable. These VRTs are subsequently passed into the PaDT decoder to produce the corresponding bounding box and segmentation mask. The overall pipeline is simple yet effective. Compared to character-by-character coordinate generation, PaDT requires far fewer tokens (only five VRTs per target) while providing stronger semantic and spatial grounding with respect to the object.

Similar observations are made in the Open-Vocabulary Detection (OVD) task. Unlike REC/RES, OVD requires PaDT to predict multiple targets along with their category labels. In our response template, both categories and VRTs are naturally interleaved within the output sequence, enabling efficient multimodal reasoning. This training strategy strengthens the semantic alignment between text and image patches, thereby improving both precision and recall in detection task.

- A.6.2 REFERRING IMAGE CAPTIONING ON RIC DATASET

Comparison with representative MLLMs. In this section, we present qualitative results for openvocabulary detection on the Referring Image Captioning (RIC) dataset, comparing PaDT with representative MLLMs, including InternVL3 8B and Qwen2.5-VL 7B models. As shown in Fig. 11, PaDT exhibits clear advantages in both bounding box accuracy and object recall. Detailed qualitative comparisons are provided in the figure, further demonstrating the effectiveness of leveraging visual reference tokens as a bridge between high-level text semantics and low-level object localization.

Visualization of PaDT results on RIC task. We further present qualitative examples generated by the proposed PaDT framework. As shown in Fig. 12, visual reference tokens are automatically generated alongside the subject, illustrating a natural interleaving between semantic text and image patches. This design further enhances object-level alignment between textual descriptions and visual elements, thereby strengthening the co-reasoning ability across text and image modalities.

- Figure 9: Qualitative comparison on COCO2017 open-vocabulary detection. We compare PaDT with representative MLLMs including InternVL3 and Qwen2.5-VL. Competing models frequently fail to produce valid outputs, leading to “Error” cases or repetitive text generation. In contrast, PaDT achieves higher recall and correctly identifies multiple objects, even in cluttered scenes with repetitive instances. These results highlight the benefit of directly predicting visual reference tokens over serialized bounding box coordinates.
