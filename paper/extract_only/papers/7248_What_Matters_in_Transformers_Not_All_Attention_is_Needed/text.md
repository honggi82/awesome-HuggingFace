ABSTRACT
While scaling Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) has demonstrated
promising performance across various tasks, it also introduces redundant archi-
tectures, posing efficiency challenges for real-world deployment. Despite some
recognition of redundancy in LLMs, the variability of redundancy across different
architectures in transformers, such as MLP and Attention layers, is under-explored.
In this work, we investigate redundancy across different modules within Transform-
ers, including Blocks, MLP, and Attention layers, using a similarity-based metric.
Surprisingly, despite the critical role of attention layers in distinguishing transform-
ers from other architectures, we found that a large portion of these layers exhibit
excessively high similarity and can be pruned without degrading performance. For
instance, Llama-2-70B achieved a 48.4% speedup with only a 2.4% performance
drop by pruning half of the attention layers. Furthermore, by tracing model check-
points throughout the training process, we observed that attention layer redundancy
is inherent and consistent across training stages. Additionally, we further propose a
method that jointly drops Attention and MLP layers, allowing us to more aggres-
sively drop additional layers. For instance, when dropping 31 layers (Attention +
MLP), Llama-2-13B still retains 90% of the performance on the MMLU task. Our
work provides valuable insights for future network architecture design. The code is

INTRODUCTION
Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced AI research, achieving
remarkable performance across various domains OpenAI (2024); Team (2024). However, scaling
these models also introduces redundant architectures, namely overarching, leading to inefficiencies
that complicate their real-world deployment Frantar et al. (2023); Sun et al. (2023), e.g., inflating
deployment costs and resource demands. For instance, while the deployment cost of Llama-2-70B
exceeds 128GB in FP16 precision—surpassing the capacity of a single A100 GPU—it can be reduced
in depth without significantly impacting performance Gromov et al. (2024).
Although several previous works have been proposed to promote LLM efficiency via removing
redundant parameters or architectures Frantar et al. (2023); Sun et al. (2023), these approaches often
employ universal techniques that overlook the unique characteristics of transformer architectures.
Specifically, transformer Vaswani (2017) architectures are composed of multiple stacked blocks,
each containing an MLP layer and an Attention layer, which serve distinct functions and exhibit
corresponding different levels of redundancy Wang et al. (2023); Shi et al. (2023) This motivates a
deeper investigation into the specific redundancies within Transformers, with the goal of identifying
and addressing the most critical modules.
In this work, we systematically explore the redundancy in three key Transformer components: Block,
MLP, and Attention. Using a similarity-based metric Gromov et al. (2024); Men et al. (2024) , we
evaluate the importance of each component and progressively drop those identified as redundant.
We first apply a “Block Drop” approach but observe that removing entire blocks leads to significant
performance degradation. This suggests a need for a more fine-grained strategy.

Upon further examination, we explore the separate pruning of MLP and Attention layers. Our
findings reveal that while dropping MLP layers negatively affects performance, a substantial portion
of Attention layers, i.e., the core of Transformer architectures which distinguish it from other
mainstream architectures (e.g., RWKV Peng et al. (2023) and Mamba Gu & Dao (2024)), can be
pruned without degrading the model’s performance. For instance, dropping 50% of the Attention
layers in Llama-2-70B Touvron et al. (2023) results in comparable performance to the full model,
indicating a high degree of redundancy in these layers.
Building on these insights, we propose a more flexible approach, “Joint Layer Drop”, which targets
both MLP layers and Attention layers. By combining the importance scores of these layers, we find
that jointly dropping low-importance Attention and MLP layers yields better performance under high
sparsity conditions compared to pruning only one type of layer.
Our work demonstrates that the redundancy in Attention layers is not only significant but also
consistent across different training stages, indicating that this redundancy is an inherent property
of Transformer architectures. These findings open the door to more efficient Transformer designs,
reducing both memory (e.g., KV-Cache) and computational costs (e.g., inference speed), while
maintaining performance.
In summary, our key contributions are as follows:
• Through an in-depth analysis of redundancy in three key Transformer components—Block,
MLP, and Attention—we uncover a surprising level of redundancy within the Attention.
• We propose “Attention Drop”, a simple yet effective algorithm for efficiently removing
redundant Attention layers in a training-free manner. Additionally, we introduce “Joint
Layer Drop”, which further improves the performance at high dropping ratios by jointly
targeting both Attention and MLP layers.
• Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of dropping Attention, for instance,
removing 50% of the attention layers in Llama-2-70B results in only a 2.4% performance
reduction while achieving up to a 48.4% speedup.
• We further show that the attention layers remain consistently high redundancy throughout
the training process, indicating it as an inherent property and providing valuable insights for
future architecture design.

RELATED WORKS
Large Language Models
Although Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) have
demonstrated promising performance across various tasks, their deployment costs remain a significant
challenge for practical usage Sun et al. (2023); Lin et al. (2024); Gromov et al. (2024). Transformer
Vaswani (2017) models consist of multiple blocks, which include Attention layers and MLP layers.
Attention layers compute the contextual information between input tokens with quadratic complexity
concerning the input sequence length Li et al. (2020). KV-Cache Pope et al. (2022) mitigates the
computational issue but results in excessive memory costs Zhang et al. (2023). MLP layers Liu et al.
(2021); Mai et al. (2022) transform each token independently, using an up-projection followed by
a down-projection, and contribute most of the model parameters. Recent works have revealed that
not all blocks or layers are equally important Men et al. (2024); Chen et al. (2024), which urges
us to reflect on the structured redundancy within LLMs and the potential design of more compact
architectures.
Model Compression
LLMs can be compressed to promote their efficiency in memory and compu-
tation. Quantization Frantar et al. (2023); Lin et al. (2024) and Pruning Sun et al. (2023); Frantar &
Alistarh (2023) are the most widely used techniques to compress LLMs. Specifically, quantization
transforms the data type into low-bit but remains potentially redundant architecture and parameters.
Pruning can be categorized into unstructured pruning Kusupati et al. (2020); Sanh et al. (2020) and
structured pruning Zhuang et al. (2020); Kwon et al. (2020). While unstructured pruning maintains
better performance than structured pruning, it cannot be effectively applied to hardware, limiting
its practical usage. Our methods, Block Drop and Layer Drop, focus on removing structured mod-
ules rather than fine-grained parameters, creating hardware-friendly efficient architectures while
2

maintaining comparable performance. Additionally, Block Drop and Layer Drop are orthogonal to
quantization, and their integration with quantization significantly enhances efficiency.

METHODOLOGY
In this section, we present the methodology for identifying and removing redundant modules in
LLMs. We begin by introducing a similarity-based metric to assess redundancy across both Attention
and MLP layers. Based on the insights gained from this analysis, we develop two targeted techniques,
i.e., MLP Drop and Attention Drop, to efficiently eliminate redundant components while preserving
model performance.
3.1
PRELIMINARIES
Similarity-based Drop
To assess the redundancy of modules in LLMs, we employ a similarity-
based metric that evaluates the importance of each module by measuring the similarity between its
input and output Gromov et al. (2024). The underlying hypothesis is that redundant modules produce
outputs that are similar to their inputs, implying minimal transformation. In contrast, important
modules are expected to significantly alter their inputs and thus should be preserved. The similarity
between the hidden states of the input X and output Y of a module is quantified using cosine
similarity. The importance score S of the module is computed as:
S = 1 −CosineSim(X, Y ).
(1)
Modules with higher cosine similarity exhibit lower importance scores, indicating redundancy. We
identify and prune the modules with the lowest importance scores according to a predefined pruning
ratio. A complete evaluation of the metric’s effectiveness is provided in Appendix B.

Block Drop
Transformer models are composed of
stacked blocks, where each block shares a common ar-
chitecture and can be viewed as a subnetwork. To reduce
complexity, we first consider dropping entire blocks that
are deemed unimportant.
As shown in Figure 2, Transformer blocks operate se-
quentially, with each block’s output feeding into the next.
To evaluate redundancy, we compute the similarity be-
tween the input and output of each block. For the l-th
block, the importance score is calculated as:
Sl
B = 1 −CosineSim(Xl
B, Y l
B),
(2)
where Xl
B and Y l
B denote the input and output of the
l-th block, respectively. Since the similarity scores are
computed locally, we can offload irrelevant modules to
save memory. By iteratively computing the importance
scores for each block from shallow to deep, we can
identify and drop blocks with the lowest scores, thus
saving memory and computational resources.
3.2
MOTIVATION
Block Drop is an aggressive technique that risks removing essential layers, as it overlooks the
internal fine-grained architectures within each block. A transformer block consists of both an
Attention layer and an MLP layer. These layers perform distinct functions, with the Attention
layer facilitating contextual information flow between tokens and the MLP layer transforming the
token representations. Given their distinct roles, we assess the redundancy of each layer separately
by measuring the importance scores of Attention and MLP layers individually. Specifically, we
leverage multiple calibration datasets to measure the importance scores, ranging from the pretraining
dataset (e.g., C4 Raffel et al. (2020)) to instruction fine-tuning datasets (e.g., CodeAlpaca-20k1,
1https://huggingface.co/datasets/sahil2801/CodeAlpaca-20k
3

MathInstruct Yue et al. (2024) and LIMA Zhou et al. (2024)). Figure 2 and 3 illustrate the varying
trend of importance scores for Attention layers compared to MLP layers across multiple datasets. This
observation motivates us to consider the varying levels of redundancy between MLP and Attention
layers and to develop more fine-grained dropping techniques accordingly, namely, MLP Drop and
Attention Drop.

Figure 4: Visualization of Layer Drop, where we visualize dropping either MLP or Attention Layers.
Given the residual connection, we take LayerNorm together with the corresponding layers. The
dropped layers with high similarity scores (i.e., low importance scores)
are blurred.
MLP Drop
As illustrated in Figure 4, each MLP layer follows a LayerNorm operation and involves
a residual connection, ensuring that part of the input is preserved in the final output. Given the input
Xl
M of the LayerNorm before MLP at the l-th Block, the output Y l
M can be formulated as:
Y l
M = Xl
M + MLP(LayerNorm(Xl
M)).
(3)
Since the output Y l
M contains both the residual and the MLP transformation, evaluating similarity
based solely on the MLP’s output can be misleading. To address this, we consider the MLP layer and
its associated LayerNorm as a single unit and compute their importance score as follows:
Sl
M = 1 −CosineSim(Xl
M, Y l
M).
(4)
By treating these layers as a single entity, we ensure a more accurate measure of importance. MLP
Drop removes both the unimportant MLP and associated LayerNorm layers. Further validation of
this approach can be found in Appendix B.
Attention Drop
Similarly, Attention layers also operate within a residual connection. The output
of the l-th Attention layer is computed as:
Y l
A = Xl
A + Attention(LayerNorm(Xl
A)),
(5)
4

where Xl
A is the inputs of the corresponding LayerNorm layers and Y l
A overall outputs that in-
volve residual connections. Like MLP Drop, we assess both the Attention layer and its associated
LayerNorm as a single unit. The importance score for the Attention layer is:
Sl
A = 1 −CosineSim(Xl
A, Y l
A).
(6)
Layer Drop, for both MLP and Attention layers, is performed in a one-shot manner, calculating
importance scores once and removing redundant layers in a single step. This approach avoids the
resource-intensive and time-consuming iterative pruning process. The effectiveness of this simple
one-shot technique is evaluated in Appendix B.
Implementation and Loading the Pruned Model
. After removing redundant layers, the pruned
model can be easily loaded using existing libraries, such as Huggingface Transformers Wolf et al.
(2020), with only minor adjustments to the model configuration. Additional implementation details
are provided in Appendix A.

INVESTIGATION OF DROPPING DIFFERENT TARGET MODULES
In this section, we conduct a comprehensive investigation into the effects of dropping different target
modules. To quantify the trade-off between performance degradation and speedup, we introduce a
new metric, i.e., Speedup Degradation Ratio (SDR), defined as:
γ =
∆Avg.
∆Speedup,
(7)
where ∆Avg. represents the percentage change in average performance across the evaluated tasks,
and ∆Speedup denotes the corresponding percentage of speedup achieved by each method. Therefore,
γ measures the amount of performance degradation incurred for each 1% increase in speedup. A
lower γ value indicates that the model achieves speedup with minimal performance loss, making it
more efficient. In contrast, a higher γ value suggests that the performance loss is substantial relative
to the speedup gained, implying a less favorable trade-off.
Table 1 and Figure 5 summarize the results of dropping different target modules, such as Block, MLP,
and Attention layers. Specifically, Table 1 shows the performance impact of dropping a fixed number
of modules (e.g., 4 and 8 layers), while Figure 5 extends this analysis by evaluating a broader range
of dropping ratios (0% to 100%).
Block and MLP Drop: Significant Performance Degradation with Moderate Speedup
Block
Drop and MLP Drop both lead to notable performance declines across both models, despite achieving
moderate speedups. For example, Dropping 4 blocks results in a 2.4% average performance decline
(from 68.2 to 65.8) for Llama-2-13B, with a speedup of 1.11×, corresponding to a γ of 0.22. However,
dropping 8 blocks causes a 7.5% performance drop (down to 60.7), with only a modest speedup of
1.24× and a higher γ of 0.31.
Similarly, MLP Drop exhibits a comparable trend, with a small decline at 4 layers (1.3%, γ = 0.32),
but a much larger drop at 8 layers (6.3%, γ = 0.79). These results suggest that while Block
and MLP Drop provide moderate speedup, they do so at the cost of significant performance
degradation, especially at higher drop ratios.
Attention Drop: Minimal Performance Impact with High Efficiency
Surprisingly, despite the
critical role of attention layers in Transformer architectures, dropping attention layers is highly
effective. Both Llama-2-13B and Mistral-7B maintain over 99% of their original performance even
after dropping 8 attention layers, as shown in Figure 5(c). For example, Attention Drop maintains
near-baseline performance even after dropping 8 layers (69.8 vs. 70.3), with a speedup of 1.23× and
a low γ of 0.02. Dropping 12 attention layers results in only a slight performance decline (67.3),
with a significant speedup of 1.40× and a γ of 0.08. The superior performance of Attention Drop
persists when compared to other compression techniques in Appendix B. These results demonstrate
that attention layers are highly redundant, and their removal has minimal impact on model
accuracy, making Attention Drop a highly efficient pruning strategy.

Larger Models Show Consistent Robustness to
Attention Drop
To verify the consistency of our
findings on larger models, we take Llama-2-70B into
consideration, since it also comes from the Llama
family and has larger model size. Specifically, we
drop the modules with different dropping ratios rang-
ing from 5% to 60% on Table 3.
Similar to the findings in smaller models, Llama-2-
70B also showcases sensitivity to Block Drop and
MLP Drop, where dropping only 10% to 20% of
blocks or MLP layers leads to a significant perfor-
mance drop.
In contrast, Attention Drop performs much better
on Llama-2-70B. Specifically, when dropping 40
out of 80 attention layers, Llama-2-70B achieves a
speedup of 1.48 and a γ of 0.05. A similar trend is observed in Llama-3, as shown in Table 2. This
robustness indicates that larger models can also tolerate the removal of a significant proportion
of Attention layers without degrading performance.
The results clearly indicate that Attention Drop is the most efficient method for pruning, allowing for
significant speedup with minimal impact on performance. In the following sections, we will examine
the efficiency improvements achieved through Attention Drop and further investigate the layer-
wise importance of attention layers to gain deeper insights into model architecture. For additional
comparisons between Attention Drop and other compression methods, please refer to Appendix B.

EFFICIENCY OF ATTENTION DROP
In this section, we evaluate the efficiency of Attention Drop in terms of both memory usage and
inference speed. Specifically, we examine the reduction in memory overhead due to the key-value
(KV) cache and measure the speedup during the entire generation phase. The results demonstrate that
Attention Drop provides substantial improvements in both efficiency metrics while maintaining high
performance.
KV-cache Memory Reduction
Given the auto-regressive nature of LLMs, where outputs are
generated token by token, the KV-cache is used to store intermediate representations of input
sequences. This cache helps accelerate inference by preventing redundant computations but comes
with a significant memory cost, especially with longer sequence lengths or larger batch sizes. Our
proposed Attention Drop method efficiently removes unimportant attention layers, reducing the
corresponding KV-cache. Table 4 provides a comparison of 16-bit precision KV-cache memory
usage before and after Attention Drop for various models, where we use 8 Nvidia RTX A6000 Ada
7

GPUs for the 70B models and 4 Nvidia RTX A6000 Ada GPUs for other smaller models. As shown,
Attention Drop results in substantial memory savings across all tested models. For instance, in
Llama-2-13B, the KV-cache is reduced from 52GB to 26GB, a 50% reduction. Note that the reported
results are based on resource-constrained scenarios. In resource-sufficient cases, where larger batch
sizes and longer sequence lengths can be applied, the memory usage savings from Attention Drop
become even more significant. These reductions are beneficial for both memory-constrained and
memory-sufficient environments, allowing for more efficient model deployment.
Table 4: Comparison of KV-cache sizes before and after Attention Drop across different models,
with a sequence length of 2048. Since only Llama-2-13B does not use grouped-query attention, the
KV-cache for each token is significantly larger compared to other models.

Speed Measurement
We also evaluate the run-time speed improvements achieved through At-
tention Drop. The inference speed is measured throughout the entire generation process, starting
from the input prompt to the generation of the final token. To ensure that the results accurately
reflect the speed improvements, we follow two key principles in our setup: (1) all operations are
performed on a single Nvidia RTX A6000 Ada GPU, avoiding any communication overhead caused
by multi-GPU setups; (2) we increase the batch sizes to maximize GPU utilization for each model.
Specifically, for Llama-2-70B, we employ 4-bit quantization due to its large model size, while noting
that Attention Drop is orthogonal to quantization shown in C. For Llama-2-13B and Mistral-7B, we
use 16-bit precision. In terms of sequence length, we use an input sequence of 2048 tokens and
autoregressively generate an additional 2048 tokens. This setup allows us to capture the full inference
process, ensuring that both the prefill (initial processing of the input sequence) and the generation
(token-by-token inference) stages are included in the speed measurements.
The speed-up ratios achieved through Attention Drop are presented in Tables 1, 2, and 3. Our results
show that Attention Drop provides up to 40% speed-up while retaining more than 95% of the original
model’s performance. Additionally, as demonstrated in Table 1, the γ values for Attention Drop are
significantly lower than those for MLP Drop and Block Drop, especially at higher speed-up ratios.
This indicates that Attention Drop achieves a more efficient trade-off between speed and performance,
making it a superior method for model acceleration.

VISUALIZATION EXAMPLES OF LAYER IMPORTANCE
In this section, we visualize the importance scores and the corresponding dropping order of pretrained
models. We then trace back through historical checkpoints to explore the dynamics of importance
scores throughout the training process.
6.1
DEEPER MODULES WITH HIGHER REDUNDANCY
Based on Figure 2, 3 and 10, we observe that the deeper layers (excluding the last ones) often exhibit
excessively low importance across Block, MLP, and Attention modules.
To further analyze the dropped modules, we visualize the dropped layers or blocks with different
dropping ratios. Figure 6 visualizes the remaining and dropped layers/blocks as the number of
dropped modules increases. Llama-2-13B and Mistral-7B exhibit similar patterns in Layer Drop and
Block Drop: initially, both models tend to drop the deeper layers, followed by the shallower ones.
These findings are consistent with Xu et al. Men et al. (2024), which suggests that deeper layers tend
to be more redundant. Larger models (e.g., Llama-2-70B) also showcase a similar trend, which is
shown in Appendix C.

6.2
CONSISTENT REDUNDANCY OF ATTENTION LAYERS THROUGHOUT TRAINING
Given that the deep layers exhibit high redundancy, to investigate how such a pattern is achieved, we
revisit the historical checkpoints to track the dynamic changing of layer-wise importance scores.
Specifically, we use checkpoints released by MAP-Neo-7B Zhang et al. (2024), due to the released
continuous checkpoints during training stages. Figure 7 presents the importance scores of Blocks and
Layers at different training stages, where Attention layers demonstrate consistently lower importance
scores than MLP and Block at all training stages. While the importance scores for MLP layers and
Blocks gradually increase as training progresses, the importance scores of Attention layers change
much more slowly.
Given the consistently higher redundancy of attention layers throughout training, we believe that this
pattern arises from the inherent properties of attention layers.

visualize the importance scores at the module index 0, since they are significantly higher.

JOINT LAYER DROP FURTHER ENHANCES THE PERFORMANCE
While a significant proportion of attention layers exhibit high redundancy, our findings also show that
some MLP layers have low importance. To further optimize model efficiency, we introduce Joint
Layer Drop, which combines both Attention Drop and MLP Drop strategies. This approach leverages
the redundancy in both attention and MLP layers to enhance the overall performance of the model.
Methodology: Combining Attention and MLP Drop
The Joint Layer Drop method is imple-
mented by first calculating the importance scores for both attention layers (Sl
A) and MLP layers (Sl
M)
individually. These scores are computed based on a similarity-based metric that identifies redundant
layers, as previously discussed. Once the importance scores are obtained for each type of layer, we
concatenate the scores into a single array: S = [Sl
A, Sl
M]. From this combined set of importance
scores, we drop the layers with the lowest values, regardless of whether they are attention or MLP
layers. This joint approach allows us to remove the most redundant components from both layer
types simultaneously, enhancing the model’s efficiency while maintaining performance.
Superior Performance with Joint Layer Drop
As demonstrated in Figure 8, Joint Layer Drop
consistently achieves better performance than either Attention Drop or MLP Drop alone. The process
begins by exclusively dropping attention layers, which are typically more redundant than MLP layers.
This continues until the number of dropped attention layers exceeds 14 for Mistral-7B and 18 for
Llama-2-13B. As a result, in the initial stages of pruning, the performance of Joint Layer Drop
overlaps with that of Attention Drop.
9

However, as the dropping ratio increases and the more redundant attention layers are pruned, MLP
layers start to become the next most redundant components. At this point, Joint Layer Drop begins
to remove MLP layers, leading to further reductions in redundant layers without significant perfor-
mance loss, e.g., after dropping 31 layers (Attention + MLP), Llama-2-13B still retains 90% of the
performance on the MMLU task.

CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSIONS
Insights for Future Network Architecture Design
Despite the success of scaling up LLMs, our
work provides valuable insights for scaling down models to achieve more efficient architectures. One
key insight is the high redundancy in attention layers, particularly in deeper layers, which suggests
that future works could reduce the number of attention layers without sacrificing performance, rather
than maintaining parity with MLP layers. Moreover, unlike MLP layers, attention layers exhibit
consistent redundancy as training progresses. This consistency may pose a bottleneck in training
large models. To address this, future research could explore replacing attention layers with alternative
mechanisms or develop new training techniques that capitalize on this redundancy to further enhance
language model capacity.
Limitations
While our proposed dropping techniques improve efficiency in the models we evalu-
ated, there are limitations. A key area for future work is testing the applicability of these techniques
across a broader range of models, such as vision transformers and vision-language models. Fur-
thermore, our methods focus on post-training dropping without involving retraining, which could
potentially recover or even improve performance after pruning. Retraining these models could unlock
even greater efficiency in more compact architectures.
Conclusion
In this work, we systematically revisited transformer architectures by investigating the
effects of dropping three types of structures: Blocks, MLP layers, and Attention layers. Our findings
reveal that attention layers display significant redundancy and can be removed in large proportions
without compromising performance. To build on this, we introduced Joint Layer Drop, a method that
further increases both dropping ratios and performance by targeting redundant layers across both MLP
and Attention layers. This study empirically demonstrates the potential for creating more compact
and efficient transformer models, providing valuable insights for future network design within the
NLP community. By exploring structured redundancy, we open up new avenues for designing more
efficient, scalable models that maintain high performance even under resource constraints.

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
Models
We utilize Llama-2 Touvron et al. (2023) and Mistral Jiang et al. (2023) as the default
models, given their competitive performance and wide usage. We also evaluated the completely open-
source model MAP-Neo Zhang et al. (2024) to explore the redundancy variations in the modules of the
entire pre-training phase. Additionally, we experimented with the newly released Llama-3 AI@Meta
(2024) to verify the effectiveness of model dropping on the latest models.
Datasets.
For the calibration dataset, we used the validation set of the C4 dataset Raffel et al. (2019),
with 256 samples and an input sequence length of 2,048, following the setup in Sun et al. (2023). To
evaluate the performance of the model, we report the results of the following tasks: BoolQ Clark et al.
(2019), OBQA Mihaylov et al. (2018), PIQA Bisk et al. (2019), RTE Wang et al. (2019), ARC-C
Clark et al. (2018), HellaSwagZellers et al. (2019), MMLU Hendrycks et al. (2021), WinoGrande
ai2 (2019) and GSM8K Cobbe et al. (2021). Please refer to Table 5 for detailed information. The
evaluation code is based on EleutherAI LM Evaluation Harness Gao et al. (2023).

“Norm” refers to the normalization
performed with respect to the length of the input.

ABLATION STUDIES
One-Shot v.s. Iterative
One-shot and iterative approaches are the two most common methods for
model compression. In the one-shot approach, importance scores are computed once, and the model
is pruned in a single step. In contrast, the iterative method computes importance scores and prunes the
model incrementally over multiple iterations. In Figure 9, we empirically compare Iterative Dropping
and One-Shot Dropping, where in Iterative Dropping, layers are removed one by one in each iteration.

Shot Dropping, without offering any significant enhancement. Given the simplicity and efficiency,
One-Shot Dropping emerges as the superior choice.

Residual Connection
The involvement of the residual connection ensures a more accurate estima-
tion by accounting for the overall inputs and outputs. To explore its impact on performance, we also
consider dropping modules without involving the residual connection. In this case, the importance
scores are measured solely by the inputs and outputs of the Attention or MLP layers. As shown in
Table 6, the involvement of the residual connection is essential for Layer Drop.
Calibration Datasets
Figure 2 and Figure 3 demonstrates the robustness of the importance scores
across different datasets. In Figure 10, we further verify that the importance scores remain relatively
stable across various modules of Mistral-7B as the sample size increases. This stability indicates
that both Block Drop and Layer Drop maintain consistency regardless of the number of samples.
Consequently, we confirm that using 256 samples is sufficient for computing similarity, which serves
as the standard adopted for all our experiments.
Dropping Metrics
We selected the Reverse Order and Relative Magnitude metrics proposed by
ShortGPT Men et al. (2024) and applied them to Attention Drop. Additionally, we considered the
random dropping of attention layers. Our experiments were conducted using the Mistral-7B model,
and the reported performance is averaged across five different random seeds. Notably, in Table 7, our
metric, Cosine Similarity, consistently outperformed the others.

Comparison with other Compression Techniques
We first compare our method with published
sparse models pruned by Shortened LLaMA Kim et al. (2024) in Table 8. Specifically, we prune the
original Vicuna-13B-v1.3 model Chiang et al. (2023) using our proposed Joint Drop technique to
maintain the same parameter budget. While Shortened LLaMA involves post-compression retraining,
training-free Joint Drop performs better on average performance. We also compare our approach
with the mainstream pruning method Wanda Sun et al. (2023) in Table 9. Under the same parameter
budget, our methods outperform Wanda with unstructured sparsity. Additionally, Wanda contributes
to fine-grained sparsity, which is not hardware-friendly and has limited practical usage.

ADDITIONAL EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
Dropping Order on Larger Models
We present the dropping order of Block Drop and Layer
Drop for the 70B Llama models in Figure 11. Similar to smaller models, larger models also tend
to drop deeper layers first. While the dropping order of Blocks differs between Llama-2-70B and
Llama-3-70B, we believe this is attributed to different training techniques, e.g., different numbers of
training tokens.

Performance on Knowledge Intensive Tasks
To assess the impact of Attention Drop on more
complex technical tasks, we evaluated Llama-2-7B and Mistral-7B, and two corresponding instruction
fine-tuned models, MetaMath-7B-V1.0 and MetaMath-Mistral-7B Yu et al. (2023). The results
in Figure 12 indicate that, except for Llama-2-7B-Math, which is MetaMath-7B-V1.0, all the
models do not experience significant performance degradation when dropping fewer than 8 Attention
layers. We speculate that this is because Llama-2-7B-Math is initialized with Llama-2-7B and
undergoes instruction fine-tuning to improve its mathematical ability. Llama-2-7B-Base exhibits
poor performance in mathematics, and the ability obtained solely through fine-tuning appears to
18

be superficial. Therefore, when dropping Attention layers, Llama-2-7B-Math’s ability rapidly
deteriorates.
We select the first sample from the test set of GSM8K2 as the input and display the MetaMath-Mistral-
7B’s raw output in Table 10. Even when dropping 10 attention layers, the model could still give
the correct answer of this question, but it failed to adhere to the correct output format. However,
when dropping 12 attention layers, the model is no longer able to produce the correct answer of this
question.
Table 10: Output Cases of Model with Dropping Some Attention Layers, where correct answers
are marked in green , while incorrect answers are marked in red . Note that “####” is used to extract
the correct answer.
Question
Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes
muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers’
market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day
at the farmers’ market?
Golden Answer
Janet sells 16 - 3 - 4 = «16-3-4=9»9 duck eggs a day.\nShe makes 9 * 2 = $«9*2=18»18

makes 9 x $2 = $«9*2=18»18 per day at the farmers’ market.\n #### 18
Attn-10
The total number of eggs the ducks lay is 16.\nJane eats 3 eggs for breakfast, so there
are 16 - 3 = 13 eggs left.\nJane bakes 4 eggs for muffins, so there are 13 - 4 = 9 eggs
left.\nJane sells the remaining 9 eggs at $2 each, so she makes 9 * $2 = $«9*2=18}
Attn-12
Dividing the total number of eggs to the number of eggs used for personal use, we get
16 - 3 - 3 = 11 eggs for selling.\nIf each egg is sold for $2, then the total amount earned
from selling is 11 * 2 = $22.\nTherefore, she makes $22 every day at the farmers’
market.\n #### 22
Attention Drop is Orthogonal to Quantization
Given that quantization simplifies data types
and enhances efficiency in memory usage and inference speed, we integrate module dropping with
quantization to verify whether the quantized models can maintain the performance achieved by
Attention Drop. Specifically, we use the mainstream AWQ algorithm Lin et al. (2024) for 4-bit
quantization, following its default settings, which involve using 128 samples from the Pile dataset
Gao et al. (2020) as the calibration dataset.
As shown in Table 11, the integration of quantization still maintains the performance of Attention
Drop, i.e., only less than 1% difference in average performance.

Attention Drop on Long In-Context Task
We evaluate the performance of Attention Drop on
the long in-context benchmark. Following LongICLBench Li et al. (2024), we present the results on
BANKING77 Casanueva et al. (2020), with the only distinction being that we sample 100 examples
from the test set. BANKING77 is a banking-domain intent detection dataset comprising 77 classes.
We evaluate from 1-shot/label to 5-shot/label, resulting in contextual lengths of 2k, 4k, 7k, 9k, 14k .
We employ the togethercomputer/LLaMA-2-7B-32K3 for Layer Drop, which enlarges the context
window of Llama-2 to 32k using position interpolation. From the results in Table 12, we observe that
Attention Drop maintains performance and outperforms MLP Drop.
