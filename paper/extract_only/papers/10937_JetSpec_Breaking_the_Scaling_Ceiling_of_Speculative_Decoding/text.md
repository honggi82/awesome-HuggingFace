### Abstract

Speculative decoding (SD) accelerates autoregressive Large Language Models (LLMs) by drafting multiple tokens and verifying them in parallel, but it faces a scaling limitation: increasing the draft budget improves speed only when acceptance remains high and drafting overhead stays low. This ceiling has been difficult to break because prior head-based SD methods face a causality-efficiency dilemma. Autoregressive drafters produce path-conditioned candidates that are effective for tree speculative decoding with higher acceptance length, but their drafting cost grows with tree depth. Bidirectional block-diffusion drafters generate all positions in one pass, but their branch-agnostic marginals can form individually plausible yet mutually inconsistent trees, wasting budget and reducing acceptance. We propose JETSPEC, a head-based SD framework that combines one-forward drafting efficiency with branch-wise causal conditioning. JetSpec trains a causal parallel draft head using fused hidden states from the frozen target model, producing candidate trees whose scores align with the target model’s autoregressive factorization. This enables JetSpec to convert larger draft budgets into longer accepted prefixes and higher end-to-end speedup. Across math, coding, and chat benchmarks on dense and MoE Qwen3 models, JetSpec consistently outperforms bidirectional-head and tree-based SD baselines. On H100 GPUs, JetSpec achieves up to 9.64× speedup on MATH500 and 4.58× on open-ended conversational workloads, with further latency gains demonstrated through vLLM integration under realistic serving loads. Our code and models are available at https://github.com/hao-ai-lab/JetSpec.

### 1 Introduction

Modern autoregressive (AR) Large Language Models (LLMs) operate under a simple yet costly bottleneck: decoding remains largely serial. This sequential generation process makes latency a major challenge when they are deployed in applications such as math [39, 47], coding [12, 22] and other agentic reasoning tasks [34, 43, 30], where models often perform long generations.

Existing approaches address this challenge by either incorporating multi-token prediction (MTP) during pre-training or mid-training [15, 10, 11, 2, 41], or post-training methods that adapt pretrained LLMs into diffusion LLMs (dLLMs) at the costs of varying degrees of performance degradation [44, 40]. In contrast, applying speculative decoding (SD) at inference time to reduce generation latency while preserving quality [24, 6].

Among these techniques, SD stands out for its low adaptation cost and simplicity. On one hand, prior work shows that SD performance can be substantially improved through lightweight draft-model alignment, oftentimes less than 1B training tokens [29, 46, 16]. On the other hand, head-based methods such as Medusa and EAGLE reduce deployment complexity by avoiding the conventional separate draft-target model setup [4, 26]. More recent head-based methods such as EAGLE-3 [27] and DFlash [7] continue to improve drafting quality and reducing drafting cost for better end-to-end

acceleration. Despite these advances, head-based SD still faces a causality-efficiency dilemma. Autoregressive drafters such as EAGLE produce high-quality path-conditioned candidates but require sequential draft passes as tree depth grows. Bidirectional block-diffusion drafters such as DFlash produces drafts in one pass, but their branch-agnostic marginals can form individually plausible yet mutually inconsistent trees, wasting budget and reducing acceptance.

We propose JETSPEC, a SD framework designed to break this causality–efficiency dilemma: JetSpec trains a causal parallel draft head to predict multiple tree nodes in one forward pass while preserving branch-wise causal conditioning through block-level causal attention over hidden states. This gives each branch a path-conditioned draft distribution aligned with the target model’s autoregressive factorization, enabling tree acceptance to better scale with additional draft budget.

Empirically, JetSpec demonstrates significant efficiency gains. In the low-token-budget regime with 16 draft tokens, JetSpec achieves competitive end-to-end speedup. In the high-token-budget regime with 256 draft tokens, JetSpec achieves strong gains, reaching τ = 10.7 and 9.5× speedup on MATH-500, and remaining effective on MT-Bench with τ = 5.9 and over 4× speedup. We further integrate JetSpec into industry-grade serving engine and evaluate it across request rates, where it consistently outperforms baselines under small to moderate serving loads, with especially strong gains on higher-end GPUs such as B200. These results highlight the practical potential of JetSpec for reducing decoding latency in serving.

In a nutshell, our work makes the following contributions:

- • We propose JETSPEC, a paradigm designed to jointly optimize drafting cost and acceptance rate for speculative decoding. JetSpec trains a causal prediction head with parallel treedrafting capability, enabling low-cost draft generation while preserving path-conditioned dependencies among draft tokens.
- • We develop and evaluate tree-drafting algorithms that allow speculative decoding to better leverage additional decoding compute. By scaling the draft token budget, JetSpec achieves up to τ = 10.7 and more than 9.5× end-to-end speedup.
- • We integrate JetSpec into an industry-grade serving engine and evaluate it under realistic serving scenarios. JetSpec consistently outperforms baselines under small to moderate serving loads, highlighting its practical potential for reducing latency in real-world deployments.

#### 2.1 Background

Scaling Bottlenecks in Speculative Decoding. In speculative decoding (SD), a lightweight approximation model Mq first proposes N draft tokens, which are then verified in parallel by the target model Mp [24]. The target model accepts the longest prefix that is consistent with its own

- Figure 2: Expected speculative decoding speedup scales as a function of draft length γ, under different per-token drafting costs c and acceptance rates α. Comparing the two panels shows that reducing c substantially improves the scalability of speculative decoding with respect to γ, and increasing α further amplifies this effect. The results highlight that pushing per-token drafting cost c low and acceptance rate α high is critical for unlocking stronger scaling with longer draft lengths.

predictions and resumes the next iteration from the first rejected token. The practical throughput of SD depends on both the acceptance rate and the relative drafting cost. Formally, let α denote the average acceptance rate and let c denote the cost coefficient between the time for a single step of Mq and that of Mp. Under the standard i.i.d. acceptance assumption, the expected number of tokens advanced per speculative iteration is

1 − αN+1 1 − α

, (1)

E[#tokens] =

where N is the number of draft tokens. Accordingly, the expected walltime improvement over standard autoregressive decoding is

1 − αN+1 (1 − α)(Nc + 1)

. (2)

Speedup =

This expression exposes a key scaling bottleneck in speculative decoding: increasing the draft length N improves throughput only when the acceptance rate α remains high and the cumulative drafting overhead Nc stays small. As N grows, even modest degradation in α or non-negligible draft cost can quickly offset the benefit of parallel verification. Figure 2 visualizes that jointly reducing drafting cost and improving acceptance quality is essential for unlocking favorable scaling with longer drafts.

Limitations of Existing Techniques. Existing work mainly focuses on improving these terms separately. To increase acceptance quality α, draft-model alignment methods improve agreement between Mq and Mp [46, 29, 16]. Orthogonally, tree-based SD methods such as SpecInfer, Medusa, and EAGLE improve verification efficiency by expanding and verifying multiple candidate branches in parallel [31, 4, 25, 27].

To reduce drafting cost c, head-based methods avoid a separately deployed draft model [4, 26, 27]. More recently, DFlash pushes drafting overhead to an even lower regime by using block-diffusionstyle drafting to generate multiple draft tokens in one draft pass and therefore very low per-token drafting cost [7], see Appendix G. However, longer-draft scaling requires both high α and low c at the same time, motivating JetSpec that jointly improves drafting efficiency and acceptance quality.

#### 2.2 Head-based Causal Parallel Drafting

Can We Enable Both? A natural direction to co-optimize both aspects is to combine tree drafting for higher acceptance with parallel drafting for lower cost. However, existing parallel drafting technique like DFlash can break the causal structure needed for effective tree construction: independently predicted future positions are not conditioned on the tokens selected along each branch, leading to inconsistent continuations. JetSpec addresses this challenge by training a causal parallel draft head that preserves branch-wise dependencies while retaining the efficiency of parallel prediction.

- Figure 3: JetSpec design overview. JetSpec extracts fused hidden features from the frozen target model and conditions a causal-parallel draft head to generate high-quality candidate trees in one forward pass.

Why Causality Matters. A key requirement for parallel tree drafting is that each node distribution should be conditioned on its own branch prefix. Consider a draft tree rooted at the original prefix x. Each node v corresponds to a candidate token yv. Let π(v) = (yv

,...,yv) denote the draft-token path from the root to v, and let π<v denote the ancestor tokens before node v. Following standard speculative decoding notation, let p denote the target-model distribution induced by target model

1

Mp, and let q denote the draft distribution induced by drafter Mq. Then q(· | x,π<v) denotes the distribution over the candidate token at node v, conditioned on the concatenated context (x,π<v).

Thus, each node v at depth i should be sampled from the continuation-aware distribution q(yv | x,π<v), rather than from a branch-agnostic per-position distribution ri(· | x) that is not conditioned on the concrete ancestor tokens selected along the branch. Without this causal conditioning, for a candidate branch y1:k, tree construction ranks branches according to a pseudo-distribution

qsur(y1:k | x) ∝

k

ri(yi | x), (3)

i=1

where ri denotes the branch-agnostic draft distribution at position i. Thus, tree construction can favor continuations whose tokens are individually plausible but mutually inconsistent. Verification

remains lossless by rejecting invalid prefixes, but the tree itself is optimized under qsur rather than a causally valid draft distribution, leading to lower acceptance. We provide an empirical case study in Section 3.4.2, with qualitative example in Appendix A.

Architecture. JetSpec adopts a head-based drafting architecture: the draft head can reuse rich intermediate features from the target model while keeping draft generation cheap. In particular, DFlash shows that a lightweight block-parallel draft head can reuse target-model hidden states and inject fused target-context features into the draft layers’ KV cache for strong target-model guidance [7]. Building on this design, JetSpec introduces a causal parallel decoding head for tree drafting.

Given a prefix x, with a corresponding fused hidden state features hox, the draft head predicts logits for multiple active tree nodes in parallel. Following the standard speculative decoding notation, let Mp denote the target model and Mq denote the draft model or draft head, with corresponding distributions p and q. The target model defines an autoregressive distribution over a length-k continuation:

p(y1:k | x) =

k

p(yi | x,y<i). (4)

i=1

To align parallel drafting with this causal factorization, we apply a tree-causal attention mask to the draft head. Each node can attend to the original prefix and its ancestors, but not to descendants or unrelated sibling branches. For two tree nodes u and v, the mask is

Mv,u =

0, if u ∈ Anc(v) ∪ {v}, −∞, otherwise,

(5)

where prefix tokens are visible to all tree nodes. The masked attention for node v is computed as

QvK⊤ √

+ Mv V. (6)

Attn(Qv,K,V ) = softmax

d

This mask allows all tree nodes to be processed in parallel while ensuring that each branch follows an autoregressive-like dependency structure. More concretely, the tree-causal mask induces a branchwise draft factorization

q(yu | x,hox,π<u), (7)

q(π(v) | x) =

u∈π(v)

This branch-wise factorization mirrors the target model’s autoregressive factorization in Equation 4, but conditions each draft node on the concrete ancestor tokens along its own path. Compared with branch-agnostic block-diffusion drafting in Equation 3, this makes the draft distribution more aligned with the autoregressive Mp while still allowing logits from all tree depths to be computed in parallel.

#### 2.3 Training

Data Preparation. We train the draft head on target-aligned sequences, obtained either from the training corpus, as in multi-token prediction [15, 10], or from continuations regenerated by the target model [1, 17, 28]. Given a sequence (x,y1:k), we sample anchor positions and, at each anchor, construct a length-N training block of N consecutive future positions. The draft head predicts these N positions in parallel under a block-causal mask, matching the per-position teacher logits produced by the target model on the same ground-truth prefix.

Distillation Loss. We train the draft head with a soft-label distillation objective so that the draft distribution preserves the target model’s relative preferences across multiple plausible continuations. Among distillation objectives, forward KL encourages the draft distribution to cover the target model’s probability mass, preserving soft-label information beyond the top prediction. Reverse KL, in contrast, is more mode-seeking and can concentrate probability on high-confidence teacher modes [17, 1]. We find this matters in practice (Section 3): reverse KL underperforms substantially, while forward KL slightly outperforms hard-label SFT. We therefore adopt forward KL by default, and present the loss in this form below.

For each active draft position m, let zq(m) and zp(m) denote the draft and target logits over the vocabulary V. We define temperature-normalized distributions q˜(m) = softmax(zq(m)/TKD) and p˜(m) = softmax(zp(m)/TKD), and minimize the forward KL

L(FKLm) = DKL p ˜(m) q ˜(m) . (8)

The final objective is computed over all active draft-token positions induced from the training sequence and normalized by the active-position mask (see Appendix D for details):

wmL(FKLm) m wm

Ltrain = TKD2 m

, (9)

where m indexes draft-token positions within sampled blocks, excluding non-loss and anchor-token positions, and TKD > 0 is the distillation temperature. This objective preserves the target model’s soft-label preferences and provides teacher-aligned candidate distributions for tree expansion.

#### 2.4 Drafting and Verification

Parallel Tree Drafting. An overview of the design is shown in Figure 3. At every decoding step i, the causal draft head conditions on the hidden states hox of tokens that were verified and accepted in the previous step, and constructs a candidate tree with maximum draft depth N, branching width W, and total node budget B. With one draft-head forward pass, we obtain logits for all draft depths and extract the top-W candidate tokens at each depth. Tree expansion is then driven by a branch scoring function s(π(v)), whose form can vary across implementations; we ablate different choices in Section 3.4. By default, we use accumulated draft log-probability for scoring:

s(π(v)) =

log q(yu | x,hox,π<u), (10)

u∈π(v)

where π<u denotes the ancestor tokens before node u. We then repeatedly pop the highest-scoring expandable node, expand it with up to W children, and reinsert the children with updated scores until the budget is filled or no expandable node remains. This yields a candidate tree T (x) = {π(v) | v ∈ VT }, where each path π(v) is a speculative continuation; details are given in Algorithm 1.

Tree Verification. After constructing the candidate tree T (x), the target model Mp verifies all tree nodes in parallel using tree attention. For any candidate branch π(v) = y1:k, the target distribution factorizes autoregressively in compliance with Equation 4.

The verifier then applies the speculative decoding acceptance rule along each candidate branch. For each draft token yt, we write the acceptance decision as

At ∼ Bernoulli(αt), αt = α(yt; q(· | x,y<t),p(· | x,y<t)), (11)

where q is the draft distribution induced by Mq, and α(·) denotes the speculative verification rule. In standard non-greedy speculative sampling, this acceptance rule uses rejection sampling:

- p(yt | x,y<t)

- q(yt | x,y<t)

, (12)

αt = min 1,

with a target-model correction token sampled when rejection occurs [24]. The accepted prefix length is a = max{r ≤ k : At = 1, ∀t ≤ r}. In the greedy setting, At becomes deterministic: a draft token is accepted if it matches the target model’s next-token prediction under the same context.

### 3 Experiments

#### 3.1 Experiment Setup

Models and Datasets. We evaluate JetSpec on Qwen3-8B and Qwen3-30B-A3B, covering both dense and MoE target models [42]. Qwen3 supports both thinking and non-thinking modes, and we use the non-thinking mode throughout our main evaluation for efficient decoding. For training data, we curate 780K examples from the Nemotron Post-Training Dataset V2 [32], including all available coding and math splits, random samples from STEM and chat splits, and 20K additional examples from CodeAlpaca [5]. For regenerated training sequences, we apply the corresponding chat template to each data type and continue generation with the target model. We evaluate on math benchmarks including GSM8K [9], MATH-500 [19], and AIME25; coding benchmarks including HumanEval [8], MBPP [3], and LiveCodeBench [22]; and open-ended conversational tasks including MT-Bench [45]. All ablation studies are conducted on the math split of Nemotron Post-Training Dataset V2.

Baselines and Training Settings. We compare against EAGLE-3 and DFlash, two strong headbased speculative decoding baselines [27, 7]. EAGLE-3 uses multi-layer feature fusion for direct token prediction, while DFlash uses a bidirectional block-parallel draft head to generate multiple draft tokens in one pass. DDTree [36] constructs draft trees from DFlash’s per-position block-diffusion distributions using best-first tree expansion, but uses a pure block-diffusion head trained without loss weighting [36]. For fair comparison, we train JetSpec and all baselines on the same data mixture using a learning rate of 3 × 10−4 on 8 H100 GPUs. We also ablate DFlash-style loss weighting in Section 3.4; additional training details are provided in Appendix D.

Implementation Details. For offline inference evaluation, we run experiments on 8 H100 or B200 GPUs. Unless otherwise specified, results in Table 2 use optimized Triton kernels for decoding. For serving-engine evaluation, we integrate JetSpec into vLLM (Appendix E), part of which involves tree verification with a custom SM90 paged FlashAttention kernel using NVIDIA CuTe DSL, extending the paged attention forward path with shared-memory tree-mask staging and tree-tail masking.

#### 3.2 Results

We evaluate JetSpec under both greedy and non-greedy decoding settings in compliance with Equation 12. Evaluation results and comparisons with baselines are summarized in Table 1 and Table 2, and it shows JetSpec consistently outperforms tree-based baselines across all benchmarks.

- Table 1: Low-budget regime comparison of JetSpec and baselines trained with the same Qwen3-8B model and data recipe. We report results on math, coding, and chat benchmarks using non-thinking mode with a 3072 max tokens. We report end-to-end decoding speedup over standard AR decoding and average accepted length τ on H100 GPU.

Low-budget Regime. Compared with the autoregressive drafting baseline EAGLE-3, JetSpec achieves substantially higher speedup at every reported budget by avoiding EAGLE-3’s higher sequential drafting overhead. At budget 16, DFlash and JetSpec perform nearly the same, suggesting that a short linear draft is already sufficient to cover many high-probability continuations. However, when increasing the budget to 32, JetSpec brings slight improvement, while DFlash often saturates or degrades. This indicates that JetSpec converts the additional draft budget into accepted tokens more effectively.

High-budget Regime. In Table 2, as the draft budget increases, JetSpec shows a larger gain, e.g. improving from roughly 4–6× to 7–10× speedup on math and coding benchmarks. Whereas DDTree scales more modestly to up to 9×, showing causal tree drafting yields higher acceptance than branchagnostic tree construction. And detailed qualitative example in Appendix A.2 on how causality helps. Under temperature 1, JetSpec remains effective, showing that the benefit of causal tree drafting remains robust under nongreedy decoding.

#### 3.3 System Performance

We evaluate JetSpec in an end-to-end serving setting by integrating tree drafting and verification into vLLM. Serving performance depends not only on accepted length, but also on how the tree budget interacts with batching, verification overhead, memory traffic, and GPU occupancy. Larger budgets can reduce the number of target-model verification rounds, but also introduce higher draft-head and tree-verification cost, making the optimal budget load-dependent.

Budget Allocation. Table 11 shows that larger tree budgets are most useful at small batch sizes. At batch size 1, increasing the budget from 16 to 128 raises throughput from 443.3 to 968.2 TPS and speedup from 3.09× to 6.75×. As batch size increases, this gain diminishes: budget 256 drops to 4.51× at batch size 16 and 2.85× at batch size 32, nearly matching budget 128. This indicates saturation, where the added verification cost and compute pressure reduce the benefit of accepting more tokens per step in throughput improvement.

Practical implication. These results suggest that tree budgets should be selected according to serving load. Large budgets are preferable in low- to moderate-load regimes, where spare GPU capacity can be used to reduce decoding iterations. Under heavier load, smaller or moderate budgets may be more efficient by reducing per-step overhead and preserving batching efficiency. We evaluate static budget policies in this work and leave dynamic serving-time budget scheduling to future work.

#### 3.4 Ablation Studies

Unless noted, all ablations in this section are evaluated on 4×B200 with block size 16, FlashAttention2 for the target’s normal forward, Triton tree-attention, and the accumulated draft log-probability heuristic (Equation 10 ) for tree construction at node budget 255. Reported speedup and average accepted length τ are invariant to hardware under lossless computation.

#### 3.4.1 Training Settings

Learning Rates. Table 3 reports a grid search over learning rates from 5 × 10−5 to 1 × 10−3. Very small learning rates underperform and performance plateaus at 3 × 10−4 (peak speedup 8.30×), with 6 × 10−4 and 1 × 10−3 within ∼2% of the peak.

Loss. Table 4 compares SFT, forward-KL distillation, and reverse-KL distillation across four math benchmarks. SFT and forward-KL distillation match within ∼3% at every dataset, while reverseKL distillation causes a 36–46% relative drop in comparison with forward-KL’s, indicating the mode-seeking objective concentrates draft probability mass too aggressively for tree drafting.

Model Generalizability. Table 5 compares JetSpec and DDTree trained on Qwen3-30B-A3B, a MoE target model, with the same 800k data recipe. JetSpec maintains a competitively higher speedups across benchmarks, showing that causal tree drafting generalizes beyond dense Qwen3-8B.

- 3.4.2 Tree Drafting with Diffusion Head

- Table 7 compares causal and diffusion heads under different choices of γ, the parameter that controls how aggressively the DFlash training objective downweights per-position loss at positions far from each anchor token. Specifically, position i within a block contributes to the training loss with weight

wi = exp(−max(i − ianchor, 0)/γ), where γ = 0 is interpreted as the limit of uniform per-position weighting (no decay). The causal head is robust across γ, while the diffusion head is sensitive to γ and collapses at the endpoints (from 8.36× at γ = 7 to 5.46× at γ = 0 and 6.17× at γ = 15).

A failure example. On MATH-500 prompt 0 at decode step 0, the diffusion-head draft (γ = 0) ranks “ given told that” first in its tree, with cumulative draft surrogate i log ri = −3.76 but cumulative target conditional i log p(yi | x,π<v

) = −63.32 nats: the branch combines two mutually exclusive openers, exemplifying the failure mode of qsur in Equation 3. The actuallycoherent “ are given that the” (target joint −0.08) sits at rank 3. The causal-head draft on the same prompt ranks “ are told that” first, with surrogate ≈ target joint (gap −0.34); tree verification accepts 6 tokens from the causal-head tree but only 4 from the diffusion-head tree (visualized in Figure 4 of Appendix A).

Aggregate generalization. Across MATH-500 prompts 0–49, the diffusion-head’s rank-1 gap exceeds the causal-head’s on 92% of prompts, with a median 5× larger (+62.81 vs. +12.36 nats); the mean per-step accepted-token ratio is 1.95×, closely matching the macroscopic 1.52× speedup ratio in Table 7. Full branch-level tables and the rank-1 gap distribution are in Appendix A.

### 4 Related Work

Speculative Decoding. Speculative decoding accelerates autoregressive generation by drafting tokens and verifying them with the target model [24, 6]. Its speedup depends on draft quality, which controls accepted length, and drafting cost, which controls wall-clock gain. Prior work improves these factors via draft-target alignment [46, 29, 16], head-based drafters such as Medusa and EAGLE [4, 26, 27], or draft-free retrieval methods such as Prompt Lookup Decoding, REST, PLD+, SAM Decoding, and SuffixDecoding [37, 18, 38, 21, 33]. While these methods reduce overhead, they often rely on lexical overlap, retrieval quality, or repeated patterns. In contrast, JETSPEC targets low-cost parallel drafting with a learned causal head that preserves branch-wise dependencies for high-acceptance tree verification.

Drafter Alignment. Previous works train draft models or draft heads to better match the target model. Multi-token prediction objectives supervise future-token predictions during pretraining or midtraining [15, 10], while post-training approaches use supervised fine-tuning, offline distillation, online distillation, or direct acceptance-rate optimization to improve agreement between draft and target distributions [46, 29, 16]. These methods primarily improve the alignment term that controls acceptance rate. JETSPEC is complementary: it trains the drafter not only to match the target model, but also to preserve the causal structure needed for budgeted tree construction, so each branch is expanded from continuation-aware draft distributions.

Parallel Decoding and Drafting. Parallel decoding methods reduce latency by relaxing strict one-token-at-a-time generation. Self-speculative decoding drafts with early target-model layers and verifies with later layers [13]. Diffusion LLMs refine multiple tokens per iteration [40, 35]. Jacobistyle methods preserve causality by parallel fixed-point updates, with recent consistency distillation works improving convergence to autoregressive outputs [14, 23, 20]. These methods increase tokens committed per forward, but are typically applied to the target model itself. DFlash is the closest baseline, generating multiple draft tokens in one block-parallel pass [7]; however, its branch-agnostic block-diffusion predictions are not explicitly optimized for causal tree construction.

### 5 Conclusion

We presented JETSPEC, a causal parallel tree drafting framework for speculative decoding that jointly addresses the two factors limiting end-to-end speedup: drafting latency and accepted length. By preserving branch-wise causal dependencies while generating candidate trees in a single low-cost draft-head pass, JetSpec makes tree construction better aligned with the target model’s autoregressive factorization. Across dense and MoE Qwen3 models and vLLM serving settings, JetSpec consistently turns larger draft budgets into higher wall-clock speedup, for MATH-500, reaching 9.64× on Qwen3-

- 8B, 9.45× on Qwen3-30B-A3B, and over 6× serving speedup on a single H100 under low-tomoderate load. These results show that block-level causality conditioning over prefix hidden states is key to scaling speculative decoding with parallel drafting that is both cheap and effective.

### A Tree Drafting Quality Analysis

This appendix provides the full data behind the rank-1 case study and the N = 50 aggregate statistics summarized in Section 3.4.2. Figure 4 visualizes the rank-1 + rank-3 contrast for both heads on MATH-500 prompt #0, decode step 0 (root token “We”); the full top-5 branches and the rank-1 gap distribution follow.

- (a) Causal head, γ = 0 rank 1 ✓ are told that gap = −0.34 faithful ⇒ verifier accepts 6 tokens

rank 3 × are given that the2product gap = +42.50

- (b) Diffusion head, γ = 0 rank 1 × given told that gap = +59.56 incoherent ⇒ verifier accepts 4 tokens

rank 3 ✓ are given that the gap = −3.69 faithful, but at rank 3

- Figure 4: Tree-quality failure mode at MATH-500 prompt #0, decode step 0. Both heads draft from the same prefix (last token “We”). The causal head’s rank-1 branch (“ are told that”) is faithful: target joint Σlog p ≈ Σlog r, so tree verification walks 6 tokens along it. The diffusion head’s rank-1 branch (“ given told that”) is incoherent (target joint Σlog p = −63.32 nats, i.e. probability ≈e−63) because its branch-agnostic per-position predictor composes “ given” (depth 1) and “ told” (depth 2) independently in the surrogate, even though no real continuation places these

two words consecutively (the surrogate qsur is formally defined in Equation 3). The actually-coherent “ are given that the” is in the diffusion tree but only at rank 3; the surrogate fails to promote it, and the verifier accepts only 4 tokens.

#### A.1 Setup

We modify the speculative decoding loop to dump the constructed tree at a chosen decode step. For every node v we record the cumulative draft surrogate depth(i=1 v) log ri(yv

The two drafts compared are a causal head and a diffusion head, both trained at LR 3×10−4 with γ = 0, evaluated on 4×B200 with block size N = 16 (also the maximum draft depth), FlashAttention-2, and Triton tree-attention. Both heads share the prefill and produce N parallel position-wise distributions r1,...,rN; tree construction uses the cumulative-log-probability heuristic with branching width W = 7 and node budget B = 255.

#### A.2 Top-5 Branches at the Canonical Example

Table 8 extends Figure 4 to the full top-5 branches of each head’s tree at MATH-500 prompt #0, decode step 0 (root token “We”). The pattern reported in the main text repeats throughout the tree. For the diffusion head, top-2 and top-4 both combine “ given” at depth 1 and “ told” at depth 2 with target joints below −50 nats; only rank-3 (target joint −0.08) is coherent. For the causal head, the rank-1 branch (“ are told that”) is faithful (gap −0.34); ranks 2–5 all share the off-argmax depth-2 token “ given” (vs. rank-1’s argmax “ told”) and degrade at depths 4–5 (e.g. “the2product” at rank 3, gap +42.50), consistent with the off-argmax inheritance described in §A.4: each branch’s depth-d marginal was anchored to the argmax extension at depth d − 1, so off-argmax branches inherit a conditioning context that does not match their own ancestor token.

#### A.3 Gap Distribution over 50 Prompts

head exhibits a dramatic upper-tail failure: 26% of prompts have rank-1 gap ≥ +80 nats (joint target probability < 10−35), versus 0% for the causal head; faithful rank-1 (gap < +5 nats) appears in only 6% of diffusion prompts versus 42% for causal. The macroscopic effect is direct: mean accepted length is 4.84 tokens for diffusion vs 9.46 for causal at γ = 0. At γ = 7, the diffusion head’s tree quality recovers substantially — its extreme tail drops to 4% and faithful rank-1 rises to 26% — with mean acceptance reaching 9.42 tokens. It does not, however, match the causal head, which retains the lower extreme tail (2%) and higher mean acceptance (9.64) at γ = 7. The takeaway is that the causal head’s rank-1 faithfulness is robust across γ, whereas the diffusion head depends on loss-weighting tuning to recover from the γ = 0 failure mode. JETSPEC ’s contribution is the structural robustness this provides: the causal mask between depths obviates the need to tune γ.

#### A.4 Why the Failure Mode Is Structural

The diffusion head produces all N position-wise distributions r1,...,rN from a single shared hidden state with no causal mask between depths, so r2 does not condition on y1. When r1 and r2 both place high mass on tokens that fit a given depth marginally but cannot follow each other syntactically (e.g. “ given” at depth 1 and “ told” at depth 2), the surrogate r1(y1) · r2(y2) promotes their composition into the rank-1 branch. The causal head’s parallel marginals are produced with causal masking between depths, so r2 is anchored to the model’s own argmax at depth 1; off-argmax branches in the heap still inherit this anchored r2, but the rank-1 branch (the argmax-aligned one, which dominates verifier behavior) receives a faithful surrogate score. This anchoring is what closes the gap between qsur and the target’s branch-conditional joint at the head of the tree, and it is what allows the causal head to remain robust across γ: the rank-1 alignment does not depend on a loss-weighting prior over depths.

### B Tree-Drafting Algorithm Details

Algorithm 1 describes how JETSPEC constructs a candidate tree under a fixed node budget. Starting from the root prefix x, the algorithm maintains a priority queue of expandable nodes ranked by a branch scoring function Score(·). At each iteration, it expands the highest-scoring node by adding up to W children at the next depth, unless the node has already reached the maximum draft depth N. Each new child is inserted back into the queue with its updated path score, and the process continues until the total node budget B is exhausted. The returned tree T (x) therefore contains the highest-scoring candidate branches according to the chosen scoring rule.

### C Tree-Drafting Algorithm Ablation

We compare three tree-construction scoring algorithms at the production setting: cumulative draft log-probability (accum_logp, our default), entropy-guided (per-depth entropy alone), and hybrid (cumulative log-probability plus α-weighted per-depth entropy). Results are summarized in Table 10.

Cumulative log-probability scoring. accum_logp achieves 8.15× speedup (average accepted length τ = 9.81) and is our production default. It expands the tree by best-first heap priority on cumulative draft log-probability along each branch, prioritizing high-likelihood continuations under the budget.

Entropy-only collapse. Entropy-guided scoring (frontier priority by per-depth marginal entropy alone, with no cumulative-log-prob signal) drops to 4.76× (−42% relative to accum_logp), confirming that per-depth entropy alone is insufficient to identify high-acceptance branches.

Hybrid scoring with increasing α. Hybrid scoring uses i log ri + α · Hi, with per-depth entropy Hi. At α ≤ 1, hybrid converges within ∼1.5% of accum_logp (8.15–8.27×); increasing α monotonically degrades acceptance, reaching 7.42× at α=8. The α → 0 limit reduces to pure cumulative log-probability (consistent with accum_logp sitting on the same plateau as low-α hybrid); the α → ∞ limit corresponds to entropy-only scoring (consistent with the 4.76× collapse).

### D Training Details

For both DFlash and JetSpec , we perform a learning-rate sweep from 1×10−4 to 1×10−3 with five settings. We find that 3×10−4 and 6×10−4 generally perform best, with different tasks favoring different choices. Since their overall performance is comparable, we report results with 3×10−4 by default. All draft-head training runs are conducted on 8 H100 GPUs with a micro batch of 2.

For a fair comparison with DFlash, the JETSPEC draft head is trained with block size 16, corresponding to a maximum tree depth of 16, and uses fused hidden features extracted from the frozen target model. During training, each block keeps the first token as the anchor and replaces the remaining positions with mask-token embeddings. The causal head predicts all masked future tokens in parallel, while each position can attend only to the prefix and earlier positions within the same block, ensuring that the draft distribution follows the autoregressive order. We sample random anchor positions from each sequence, use up to 512 anchors per example. An example of the attention mask with 3 anchors for 3 blocks is provided in Figure 5.

[Figure 7]

- Figure 5: Causal attention mask used for training with multiple sampled blocks. Each query can attend to the full verified prefix and to the anchor plus earlier positions within its own block, but cannot attend to future positions or positions from other sampled blocks.

JETSPEC reuses intermediate representations from the frozen target model as draft-head context. For Qwen3-8B, we extract hidden states from target layers {1,9,17,25,33} out of the 36-layer target model, concatenate them along the channel dimension, and project the resulting 5d feature back to hidden size d = 4096 through a bias-free linear layer followed by RMSNorm. The draft head is implemented as a lightweight Qwen3-style decoder with 5 layers, 32 attention heads, 8 KV heads, head dimension 128, and MLP intermediate size 12288. In each draft layer, the projected target feature is injected as contextual key/value states and concatenated with the draft-token hidden states,

[Figure 8]

- Figure 6: Each sampled block includes an anchor position and multiple future token positions. The anchor is retained as block context and excluded from the loss, while loss is applied only to future token positions within each block.

allowing the causal draft head to condition on rich target-model features while keeping the target model frozen.

For ablations, we consider DFlash-style exponential depth weighting. Since depth weighting can implicitly bias the bidirectional DFlash head toward left-to-right prediction, in main results reported in Table 1 and Table 2, we remove it when isolating the effect of causal masking versus the native blockdiffusion head design. For distillation runs, teacher logits are obtained from the frozen target model and aligned with the student prediction positions; the draft head is trained with a temperature-scaled soft-label distillation loss.

### E vLLM Implementation Details

We implement causal parallel tree drafting inside vLLM. The draft head uses causal attention, while its candidates are organized as a speculative tree rather than a linear block.

Given the target hidden states at the current decoding step, the proposer produces draft logits for a block of future positions. For each position, it extracts the top-k tokens and log-probabilities, where k is the tree width, and constructs a speculative tree under a fixed node budget. Our implementation supports several expansion scores, including cumulative log-probability, entropy-guided scoring, and hybrid scoring, as discussed in Appendix C. We use cumulative log-probability in our experiments. The resulting tree stores token ids, parent indices, and node depths, with the root corresponding to the already-sampled next token.

During verification, the tree metadata is passed to the target model as parent indices and depths for all speculative nodes. The target verifies all tree nodes in one forward pass using a tree attention mask. To reduce verification overhead, we implement an optimized fused paged tree-attention kernel: it builds the ancestor relation for speculative nodes, applies the tree mask inside attention, and verifies all candidates without materializing a dense per-request mask. Acceptance is computed by comparing each node token with the target model’s greedy prediction at its parent, then selecting the deepest fully accepted root-to-node path. The accepted path is committed, and the target prediction at the final accepted node is used as the correction token.

Table 11 reports an example end-to-end vLLM run on HumanEval with a single H100 GPU. The results show how tree budget interacts with serving batch size: larger budgets improve low-batch latency by reducing verification rounds, while their relative gain decreases at larger batch sizes as verification and memory pressure become more prominent.

### F Ablation Study Details

We provide detailed ablation results for the training and generalization settings summarized in Section 3. Unless otherwise specified, ablations are conducted on the Nemotron Post-Training Dataset V2 math split, using Qwen3-8B with block size 16, tree node budget 255, accumulated draft log-probability for tree construction, and the same evaluation protocol as the main experiments.

Learning Rate. Table 3 studies the effect of draft-head learning rate. Very small learning rates underfit the drafter, while performance plateaus around 3 × 10−4; larger rates remain competitive but do not provide consistent additional gains.

Training Objective. Table 4 compares SFT, forward-KL distillation, and reverse-KL distillation. SFT and forward-KL perform similarly, while reverse-KL substantially degrades performance, suggesting that mode-seeking distillation is poorly matched to budgeted tree drafting, where preserving multiple plausible continuations is important.

Model Generalizability. Table 5 evaluates whether JetSpec generalizes beyond dense Qwen3-8B. On the Qwen3-30B-A3B MoE target model, JetSpec continues to outperform DDTree under the same training recipe, showing that causal parallel tree drafting is not specific to a single model architecture.

Training Data. Table 6 compares regenerated target-model sequences with direct corpus training. Regenerated data gives the strongest performance by better matching the target model’s own generation distribution. Corpus-trained JetSpec is weaker but still effective.

### G Empirical Per-token Drafting Cost on Modern Hardware

Figure 2 shows that speculative decoding scales better with draft length when the per-token drafting cost is low. In this appendix, we measure this cost for a practical DFlash-style draft head on a single H200 NVL GPU. We use N to denote the draft depth, i.e., the number of draft tokens proposed in one block. We sweep context length and draft depth with request batch size fixed to one, and report the per-draft-token cost ratio corresponding to the coefficient c in Eq. equation 2.

Setup. We profile a DFlash configuration using Qwen3-8B as the target model and z-lab/Qwen3-8B-DFlash-b16 as the draft head. Each cell reports steady-state latency after 10 warmup steps and 50 measurement steps, measured with CUDA events using the PyTorch SDPA backend. For context length L and draft depth N, let Tdraft(N,L) denote the latency of one parallel draft-head forward pass that proposes N tokens, and let Tverify(N,L) denote the latency of one parallel target-model verification pass over the same N candidates. Following Eq. equation 2, we define the per-draft-token cost coefficient as

Tdraft(N,L)/N Tverify(N,L)

c(N,L) =

Tdraft(N,L) N Tverify(N,L)

=

.

The factor 1/N amortizes the parallel draft-head forward cost across the N proposed tokens. Lower c indicates cheaper marginal drafting relative to one target verification pass.

Results. Table 12 reports c in percent over a sweep of context lengths L∈{128,...,4096} and draft depths N ∈{1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128,256,512}.

Across the practically relevant regime (L ≤ 2048, N ≥ 16), the per-draft-token cost is below 1% of one target verification pass and decreases roughly as 1/N, since the parallel draft-head cost is amortized across more proposed tokens. At L=1024, for instance, c drops from 0.845% at N =16 to 0.054% at N =256, close to the ultra-low-cost regime in Fig. 2. Longer contexts increase the cost mildly, but c remains below 0.1% for N ≥256.

- Table 12: Per-draft-token drafting cost ratio c = Tdraft/(N Tverify) (%) on a single H200 NVL GPU, sweeping context length L and draft depth N. This is the cost coefficient used in Eq. equation 2 and Fig. 2. Lower is better.

Implication. These measurements support the main scaling argument: increasing the draft depth N amortizes the draft-head cost and lowers the effective per-token cost coefficient c. On the same hardware, c decreases from ≈ 6.7% at N =2 to ≈ 0.05% at N =256, moving from the typical-cost regime toward the ultra-low-cost regime in Fig. 2. However, as Fig. 2 illustrates, low cost enables long-draft scaling only when acceptance remains sufficiently high. This motivates causal tree drafting as a way to improve acceptance quality in the low-cost speculative decoding.
