Abstract
The training of large language models (LLMs) is
expensive. In this paper, we study data-efficient
approaches for pre-training LLMs, i.e., techniques
that aim to optimize the Pareto frontier of model
quality and training resource/data consumption.
We seek to understand the tradeoffs associated
with data selection routines based on (i) expensive-
to-compute data-quality estimates, and (ii) max-
imization of coverage and diversity-based mea-
sures in the feature space. Our first technique,
ASK-LLM, leverages the zero-shot reasoning ca-
pabilities of instruction-tuned LLMs to directly
assess the quality of a training example. To tar-
get coverage, we propose DENSITY sampling,
which models the data distribution to select a
diverse sample. In our comparison of 19 sam-
plers, involving hundreds of evaluation tasks and
pre-training runs, we find that ASK-LLM and
DENSITY are the best methods in their respec-
tive categories. Coverage sampling can recover
the performance of the full data, while models
trained on ASK-LLM data consistently outper-
form full-data training—even when we reject 90%
of the original dataset, while converging up to
70% faster.
1. Introduction
Large language model (LLM) pre-training is perhaps the
most data- and compute-intensive task attempted by the
machine learning community to date, with impressive capa-
bilities primarily being accomplished by training massive
transformer architectures on trillions of tokens of text (Ope-
nAI, 2023; Gemini et al., 2023; Touvron et al., 2023b).
But even these incredibly capable LLMs are subject to em-
pirical scaling laws, which predict sharply diminishing re-
turns from a linear increase in model- or data-size (Hoff-
mann et al., 2022; Kaplan et al., 2020). Power-law scaling
therefore acts as a soft limit on model quality, beyond which

it is prohibitively expensive to drive performance by scal-
ing up the data or model. At the same time, Sorscher et al.
(2022)—in the context of vision pre-training—show that
we can significantly improve the power law constants in
the aforementioned scaling laws if we prioritize important
training examples using some robust notion of data quality
or impact.
A similar call for data-curation is also apparent in the context
of training LLMs, where our largest models are quickly ap-
proaching their capacity and data thresholds. LIMA (Zhou
et al., 2023) showed that LLaMA-65B (Touvron et al.,
2023a) can be better aligned with human preferences when
trained on a set of 1,000 carefully selected fine-tuning
prompts, compared to training on as much as 52,000 unfil-
tered examples. Tirumala et al. (2023) recently conducted a
large-scale data-efficient pre-training evaluation, showing
that a 6.7B OPT model (Zhang et al., 2022) can converge up
to 20% faster on data curated by a technique based on strati-
fied cluster sampling. The Phi-2 experiments also suggest
that when data curation is performed at a human-expert level
(e.g., by textbook editors), models can outperform baselines
that are up to 25x larger (Javaheripi et al., 2023).
Data curation routines can be fundamentally characterized
as selecting training samples for quality, coverage, or some
mixture of both (Figure 2). In this work, we seek to under-
stand how quality and coverage affect the data efficiency of
LLM pre-training. Our core research question is:
“Are cheap-to-compute heuristics like maximum-
coverage enough to pre-train a SoTA LLM, or
are there real benefits from costly samplers that
carefully evaluate the quality of each example?”
This question is crucial to answer because data-curation
algorithms can improve the Pareto frontier of the data-
quantity↔model-quality tradeoff, directly addressing the
bottleneck of power-law scaling by enabling higher-quality
models to be trained using less data. Data curation also
unlocks new tradeoffs between training time, inference cost,
data collection effort, and downstream performance. For
example, if we consider the compute-constrained (single-
epoch) regime, a data-efficient LLM training routine may
reach the desired performance using only X% of the data

(corresponding to an X% training speedup).
Despite considerable interest from the community for build-
ing data-efficient training methods (Sorscher et al., 2022;
Paul et al., 2021; Coleman et al., 2020; Jiang et al., 2019;
Katharopoulos & Fleuret, 2018), large-scale analyses of data
pruning strategies are rare because of the extreme computa-
tional cost—especially in the context of LLM pre-training.
To be more specific, an extensive comparative study neces-
sarily entails pre-training (i) various sizes of LLMs, (ii) for
a variety of data sampling rates, (iii) obtained through vari-
ous pruning strategies. Further, downstream evaluations for
LLMs also frequently involve fine-tuning, which is resource
intensive in itself.
1.1. Contributions
We hypothesize that the roles of coverage and quality de-
pend on the stage of training, size of the model, and the
sampling rate. To understand the coverage/quality design
choice better, we develop new data-efficiency routines that
independently (and solely) target quality and coverage. Our
ASK-LLM sampler prioritizes high-quality and informative
training samples by asking a proxy LLM. Our DENSITY
sampler seeks to maximize the coverage of latent topics in
the input dataset through a diversified sampling procedure.
To summarize, our contributions are as follows:
ASK-LLM sampling. We find that ASK-LLM can train
better models (vs. training on the entire dataset) even af-
ter removing up to 90% of training samples, while also
consistently beating well-established data curation routines.
We note that even a tiny proxy model in ASK-LLM (60M
parameters) can outperform most baselines.
Exhaustive benchmark. We implement 19 different sam-
pling strategies for pre-training T5-Large (800M) and T5-
Small (60M) on 524B tokens and evaluate them on 111
downstream evaluation tasks. This leads to a total of 170
pre-training and 2, 500 fine-tuning runs.
New insights. By analyzing the differences between ASK-
LLM and DENSITY sampling, we study the role of coverage,
quality, and sampling cost in LLM pre-training. We support
our conclusions with additional studies of the convergence
rate, correlations between sampler outputs, and impact of
sampling cost on downstream performance.
Takeaway. Our results show that while coverage sampling
can recover the performance of the full data, ASK-LLM
(quality filtering) can often exceed it. These experiments
suggest that LLM-based quality raters are a worthwhile and
effective way to drive performance in pre-training.
2. Related Work
Data selection is a classical problem with well-established
literature on coresets, sketching, importance sampling, filter-
ing, denoising, and a host of other algorithms with similar
goals. While we cannot possibly catalog the entire sampling
literature, we hope to provide an overview of the principles
behind common data selection algorithms. We also describe
how these algorithms have been applied to machine learning,
with a focus on language model training.
2.1. Coverage Sampling
The first class of methods maximize the coverage of the
sample by selecting points that are evenly distributed across
the entire input domain, e.g., an ϵ-net for a Lipschitz func-
tion (Phillips, 2017). When training language models, cov-
erage sampling is motivated by the intuition that we ought
to show the model the full breadth of genres, topics, and
languages (Longpre et al., 2023b). Coverage sampling is
typically accomplished by embedding examples into a met-
ric space and selecting points which are mutually far from
each other (Lee et al., 2023).
Cluster sampling algorithms group inputs based on embed-
ding similarity and select representatives from each group.
These algorithms are popular, scalable, interpretable, and
enjoy strong theoretical support – k-means sampling prov-
ably approximates the SVM objective (Tukan et al., 2021)

and many others (Feldman et al., 2020). However, there are
also recent techniques based on submodular optimization of
a coverage score (Chen et al., 2012; Indyk et al., 2014; Bor-
sos et al., 2020), models of the data distribution (Coleman
et al., 2022), discrepancy minimization (Karnin & Liberty,
2019), and deduplication through token matching / locality-
sensitive hashing (Lee et al., 2022).
Many variations of cluster sampling have been applied to
vision and language model training. Sorscher et al. (2022)
propose the “SSL prototypes” method for vision models,
which removes points that fall too close to the nearest k-
means centroid. SemDeDup (Abbas et al., 2023) also re-
moves points based on this distance, but targets pairs of
nearby examples, or “semantic duplicates,” and prefers
points close to the centroid. The D4 sampler chains Min-
Hash deduplication, SemDeDup, and SSL prototypes to-
gether to prune both high-variance, sparse regions and pro-
totypical, dense regions of LLM pre-training datasets (Tiru-
mala et al., 2023). Coleman et al. (2020) considers a k-
centers submodular selection routine on the last-layer em-
beddings of ResNet vision models.
2.2. Quality-score Sampling
Another class of methods are based on quality scores, where
a scoring algorithm rates every example and the sampler
preferentially selects points with high scores. Even though
this framework was originally developed for importance
sampling (Hastings, 1970), the machine learning community
has expanded the theoretical “score-and-sample” framework
to include a variety of practical heuristics.
For example, the selection-via-proxy (SVP) algorithm de-
termines the importance of an input using the validation
loss and uncertainty scores of a pre-trained model on the
input (Coleman et al., 2020; Sachdeva et al., 2021). Paul
et al. (2021) sample according to an “EL2N score” formed
by ensembling the losses of 10 lightly-trained models. En-
semble prediction variance has also been used as the scoring
metric (Chitta et al., 2021), as have ensemble disagreement
rates (Meding et al., 2021). Other scores measure whether
an example is likely to be forgotten (Toneva et al., 2019),
memorized (Feldman & Zhang, 2020), or un-learnable (Min-
dermann et al., 2022).
In the context of pre-training LLMs, there exist a few dif-
ferent schools-of-thought for scoring the quality of train-
ing samples. The first (and arguably most used) camp is
perplexity-filtering, where we prioritize samples with low
perplexity and filter out highly surprising examples (Wen-
zek et al., 2019; Marion et al., 2023; Muennighoff et al.,
2023). Notably, recent advancements in cheaper to run
model-based training-run simulators for LLMs can be used
to estimate the perplexity of a training sample instead of run-
ning an LLM inference (Guu et al., 2023). Another group
of methods selects training data that minimizes the distance
between the distribution of selected data and a handcrafted
high-quality data source (typically wikipedia and books).
Typical ways are to do this in a feature space (Xie et al.,
2023b) or by training a contrastive-style classifer (Radford
et al., 2019; Anil et al., 2023; Javaheripi et al., 2023). Sim-
ilar ideas have also been explored for optimizing the data
mixture weights for pre-training (Xie et al., 2023a).
In concurrent work, Maini et al. (2024) also consider an
LLM-based approach similar to our ASK-LLM sampler,
but with a focus on data paraphrasing rather than selection
via quality evaluation. Engstrom et al. (2024) consider a
quality evaluation based on datamodels, though their anal-
ysis suggests that this approach selects for strongly model-
dependent notions of quality.
3. Methods
We propose two samplers, ASK-LLM and DENSITY. These
samplers have significantly different costs—ASK-LLM re-
quires an LLM inference call for each training sample,
whereas DENSITY is based on a diversified sampling rou-
tine that is cheaper than even clustering the dataset. They
also exhibit substantially different selection behavior: ASK-
LLM conducts a highly nuanced and contextual quality
evaluation for each sample, while DENSITY asks whether
we have already sampled many similar examples. By study-
ing samplers on extreme ends of this spectrum, we hope to
better understand the salient factors for LLM data curation.
3.1. ASK-LLM Sampling
Intuition. Our intuition is that humans can easily identify
commonly occurring failure modes in state-of-the-art data
quality scorers. Hence, it should be possible to correct
these mistakes using the reasoning capabilities of modern
instruction-tuned LLMs.
To do so, in ASK-LLM, we prompt an instruction-tuned

proxy LLM with the prospective training example and ask
whether the example should be used for training (see Fig-
ure 3 for the prompt). We take the softmax probability of the
token “yes” as the estimated data-quality score. Consider
the following common failure modes of perplexity filter-
ing, which the ASK-LLM scoring model fixes (see more
qualitative examples in Appendix E).
Contextuality. Perplexity filters often select samples that
lack context, e.g., containing questions without answers
(Examples 11, 12, 15). ASK-LLM correctly identifies that
these examples do not provide new information.
Nonsense. Perplexity filters can select examples that end-
lessly repeat the same phrases / words (Examples 14 and
15), likely because these word combinations are common
(resulting in high likelihood).
Niche examples. Perplexity filters can reject niche topics
that are otherwise informative, well-written, and contain
useful tail knowledge of the world. Example 17 contains
detailed information about a Manchester art installation
but is assigned a high perplexity, likely because it contains
uncommon (but valid) word combinations. Examples 20-22
display similar behavior for other niche topics.
3.2. DENSITY Sampling
Intuition. Our intuition is that the data distribution provides
a strong coverage signal. High-probability regions contain
“prototypical” examples—ones with many near-duplicates
and strong representation in the dataset. Low-probability
regions will contain outliers, noise, and unique/rare inputs.
If we wish to maximize topic coverage, we should boost the
signal from under-represented portions of the input domain
and downsample redundant, high-density information.
The key difficulty for our DENSITY sampler is to accurately
estimate an example’s local density. Like Tirumala et al.
(2023) (D4), we assume access to embeddings from a pre-
trained LLM. However, we depart from the traditional ap-
proach of clustering and opt to sample based on kernel sums.
Given a dataset D of embeddings and a kernel k(x, y), we
estimate the density using the following score.
score(y) =
X
x∈D
kλ(x, y).
λ is a smoothing parameter called the kernel bandwidth that
controls the scale of the points’ effects. To reduce the com-
plexity from O(N 2) to O(N log N), we use recent break-
throughs from the algorithm community to approximate
the sum (Siminelakis et al., 2019; Coleman & Shrivastava,
2020). Our method resembles that of Coleman et al. (2022),
except that (i) we adopt a two-pass sampling algorithm with
stronger theoretical guarantees (Theorem A.2) and (ii) we
perform the density estimation in the latent space of the
model, rather than using Jaccard distances on n-grams.
3.3. Sampling Techniques
DENSITY and ASK-LLM are both scoring methods that
reduce an example to a floating point value that measures
coverage or quality. Once we have scores for a complete
dataset of training examples (sentences, paragraphs, etc.),
we can make score-based decisions about which examples
to include in the training set.
Top / Bottom K. The simplest method is to sort examples
by score and accept the top or bottom K. While straight-
forward, this approach is supported by the “permutation”
theory of Sorscher et al. (2022), and sensitivity score sam-
pling (a softened version) is the core subroutine for many
coresets (Mai et al., 2021). When applied to DENSITY and
perplexity scores, top-K sampling selects for the head of
the data distribution (similar to SSL prototypes). Bottom-K
sampling selects the tail and removes common items.
Inverse Propensity Sampling. Inverse propensity sam-
pling (IPS) selects items proportional to their reweighted
and normalized inverse score (Rosenbaum & Rubin, 1983).
When applied to DENSITY or perplexity scores, IPS imple-
ments a form of diversified sampling that uniformizes the
distribution of selected inputs (Theorem A.2).
In our experiments, the DENSITY sampler uses IPS to max-
imize the coverage of the dataset.1 For our ASK-LLM
filter, we adopt top-k sampling because we expect the “yes”
probability to be a reliable and strong measure of quality.
3.4. Relationships Between Methods
DENSITY, Perplexity, and Loss. When a language model
is trained to minimize perplexity, the LLM itself is a data
distribution model. Therefore, the perplexity and loss fil-
1We also implemented top-K and bottom-K sampling, but
these samplers do not maintain coverage and perform poorly.

How to Train Data-Efficient LLMs
tering approaches of Marion et al. (2023), Muennighoff
et al. (2023), and other authors can be viewed as model-
based density sampling. However, our sampler measures
the density of the training dataset in a latent geometric space,
while perplexity measures the likelihood under the scoring
model. The samplers also differ in terms of decision com-
plexity. Thanks to the capacity of the LLM, a perplexity
filter can make highly-nuanced decisions between two texts
on the same topic. On the other hand, our DENSITY sam-
pler is constructed from a simple nonparametric density
model (Rosenblatt, 1956) that does not have the capacity to
distinguish examples at such a granular level.
ASK-LLM and Perplexity. Perplexity filters exhibit a
strong in-distribution bias, making decisions based on the
data used to train the scoring model (not the dataset we
wish to sample). By using the LLM for quality evaluation
rather than likelihood estimation, our sampler can escape
this bias because the additional context and alternative task
change the sampling distribution. This occurs even when
the ASK-LLM and perplexity models are the same size.
DENSITY and Clustering. The kernel sum procedure at
the core of our DENSITY sampler operates on embedding-
similarity relationships in a similar way to D4, SemDeDup,
and SSL prototypes. Indeed, near-duplicate detection can be
viewed as a discretized version of similarity-based density
estimation (Kirsch & Mitzenmacher, 2006). Outlier rejec-
tion, which motivates the “nearest-to-centroid” heuristic of
SSL prototypes, also has intimate connections with density
estimation (Schubert et al., 2014).
Intuition. Perplexity should be viewed as a “difficulty”
or “quality” score rather than as a coverage-maximizing
score. Our ASK-LLM sampler should be viewed as a con-
textualized quality score that incorporates reasoning.2 Our
DENSITY sampler is a pure “coverage” score in the latent
representation space, while SemDeDup, and SSL Prototypes
all incorporate quality / outlier filtering to some extent (e.g.,
by preferring points near / far from a centroid).
4. Experiments
4.1. Models
We pre-train T5-style models (Raffel et al., 2020), which
belong to the encoder-decoder family of Transformer mod-
els and offer competitive performance on many tasks (Shen
et al., 2023). See Phuong & Hutter (2022) for a formal
introduction to various Transformer model configurations.
We train T5-Small (60M) and T5-Large (800M), reusing all
of the training settings from the original T5 implementation
except the batch size (2048 →1024). We train on batches

because it does not suffer from in-distribution bias.
of 1024 sequences of length 512 for 1M steps.
For the quality-based data samplers (ASK-LLM and Per-
plexity filtering) we use proxy quality scoring models of
five different sizes: T5-{Small, Base, Large, XL, XXL}.
For ASK-LLM, we use FLAN-T5. For ASK-LLM, we
use FLAN-T5, which are the same sizes but have been
instruction-tuned on Flan (Longpre et al., 2023a).
4.2. Datasets
We use the C4 dataset3, which was also used for pre-training
the original T5. The C4 dataset is a version of the Common
Crawl—a publicly available archive of web-text—that has
been pre-processed using several heuristics (Raffel et al.,
2020, Section 2.2). In its entirety, the C4 dataset contains
184B tokens. We use our algorithms (see Appendix B for a
list) to sample {10, 20, 40, 60, 80}% of C4.
Because a low sampling ratio yields exceedingly small
datasets, we choose to train in the iso-compute setting, i.e.,
training all models for exactly 524B tokens. This results in
more epochs (repetitions) at smaller sampling rates. We be-
lieve this gives each data curation method an equal chance
to maximize model performance, and not penalize meth-
ods that sample a small number of high-quality repeatable
tokens vs. large number of non-repeatable tokens. See
Appendix B, Figure 8 for a demonstration of this process.
4.3. Evaluation
We use 111 downstream evaluation tasks to assess di-
verse performance indicators for pre-trained LLMs (see
Appendix C for a complete list). In addition to these indi-
vidual tasks, to compare a normalized average performance
improvement over all downstream evaluations, we devise a
metric called “over-scaling.”
Over-scaling (%) measures the relative improvement of
a model when compared against the next-largest model
size, averaged over all downstream evaluations listed in
Appendix C. For example, a T5-Large variant with 100%
over-scaling performs at the same level as T5-XL, while
the standard T5-Large model would have an over-scaling of
0%. We call this metric over-scaling because it measures
the extent to which the performance exceeds the level we
would expect from naïvely scaling up the model or data.
We compute the metric by normalizing the performance
improvement from sampling, e.g., for T5-Large:

4.4. Does reasoning improve data efficiency?
Figure 4c shows that ASK-LLM closes up to 33% of the
performance gap to the next-largest model size (i.e., the
over-scaling metric). ASK-LLM consistently outperforms
training on the full dataset as well as perplexity filtering
(and coverage-maximizing baselines), despite having access
to a scoring model of the same model capacity (XL). Similar
findings hold true for training efficiency (Figure 5). ASK-
LLM converges faster than perplexity filters, both in terms
of the average (expected final performance over all proxy
model sizes) and pointwise for the best configuration (Small
and XL for training T5-Small and T5-Large).

Figure 5. Training efficiency comparison between two quality-score based samplers: ASK-LLM and Perplexity filtering. ASK-LLM
(Avg.) and Perplexity filtering (Avg.) represent the training run averaged across (i) proxy model sizes, i.e., T5-{Small, Base, Large, XL,
XXL}; and (ii) sampling ratios, i.e., {10, 20, 40, 60, 80}%. The training runs for ASK-LLM and perplexity filtering with T5-{Small,
XL} specifically are averaged only over the sampling ratios. Each point in this plot is the (averaged) performance of an intermediate
checkpoint during the course of training on sampled data.
Figure 7 further demonstrates that prompting adds criti-
cal information to the sampler not present in perplexity:
ASK-LLM scores show no correlation with the perplex-
ity scores. Based on this clear behavioral difference, we
conclude that reasoning and context are crucial ingredients.
We expect prompting techniques such as chain-of-thought
reasoning (Wei et al., 2022) to further drive performance.
4.5. When are expensive quality scores justified?
Figures 4c and 4f suggest that coverage scores—especially
those provided by DENSITY—perform well in the mid-
data regime (roughly 25% to 50% sampling rate).
On
the other hand, expensive quality scoring—via the ASK-
LLM procedure—is Pareto optimal for the entire quantity-
quality trade-off. The higher costs of LLM-based filters
are most justified in two scenarios: (i) improving full-data
performance, where quality filtering by removing the lowest-
quality data is the main way to push the upper limit of model
performance; or (ii) in the low-data regime, where keeping
only the highest-quality data drives the most model perfor-
mance compared to other sampling strategies.
We also observe that random sampling is a strong baseline,
aligning with recent observations in the literature. Guo
et al. (2022a) found that only three methods outperformed
random sampling in a computer vision benchmark of 15
algorithms. Ayed & Hayou (2023a) prove the existence of
adversarial problem instances where score-based sampling
cannot outperform random sampling. These results only
serve to highlight the significance of ASK-LLM’s gains.
4.6. Effect of quality-scoring model capacity
Figure 6 demonstrates a clear scaling trend for ASK-LLM’s
quality-scoring model: larger scoring models are increas-
ingly beneficial as the scale of the to-be-trained LLM in-
creases. Perplexity filters do not seem to exhibit such trends.
The strongly consistent scaling for ASK-LLM also suggests
an interesting performance-recipe: to improve downstream
data-efficiency, use better quality-scoring models. Creating
better quality scorers for ASK-LLM (via fine-tuning, chain-
of-thought prompting, more capable scoring models, etc.)
is thus an exciting direction for future work.
Despite the scaling trends, we would also like to empha-
size that even small ASK-LLM models provide compelling
sampling performance already for both training T5-Small
and T5-Large models. For example, ASK-LLM (Small)
outperforms perplexity filtering with any scoring-model in
Figure 4f (including T5-XXL) by a sizable margin.
4.7. Do samplers prioritize different examples?
To understand whether different algorithms prioritize differ-
ent examples, we sorted examples by score and computed
the Kendall Tau rank correlation between samplers (Fig-
ure 7). We find that samplers differ in significant and inter-

esting ways. For example, the “T5-Large” row shows that
(i) T5-Large outputs perplexity scores similar to T5-Small
early in training, but becomes progressively more nuanced
on the path from 20k to 700k training steps, and (ii) perplex-
ity and ASK-LLM select for wildly different criteria, with
almost no ranking correlation.
DENSITY prioritizes coverage over de-noising, maintain-
ing the in-distribution test perplexity better than any other
strategy (Figures 4a and 4d). This suggests that coverage
sampling preserves the objective function, in contrast with
other methods that preferentially select for quality in addi-
tion to diversity.
5. Discussion
Amortized scoring. The ASK-LLM and perplexity scorers
require considerable computation—one LLM inference call
for every training sample—which is concerning from both a
carbon-emissions and cost perspective (Strubell et al., 2019).
However, we argue that the scoring costs are amortized over

many pre-training runs, which together cost significantly
more than the ASK-LLM inference calls (Luccioni et al.,
2023). In practical systems, cheaper samplers / scoring
models can also pre-filter examples for our more expensive
scorers. While LLM pre-training is often thought of as a
one-time cost, this has historically not been the case. We
therefore view quality scores as a long-term investment.
See Appendix A.1 for a deeper discussion about the cost of
ASK-LLM scoring.
LLM-Based Data Refinement. Recursively training on
model-generated data causes degredation in both diffusion
models and LLMs, inciting concerns about whether the inter-
net will remain a viable source of training data (Shumailov
et al., 2023; Alemohammad et al., 2023; Briesch et al., 2023).
It is therefore somewhat surprising that LLMs are so ef-
fective at deciding which training data to consume. Our
ASK-LLM results raise important questions about whether
LLM-based filters can function as an intervention in the
self-consumption loop, allowing LLMs to self-improve.
6. Conclusion
We studied the performance of sampling algorithms that
select high-quality data through highly-capable proxies and
maximize coverage through embedding similarity. Our ex-
periments reveal that LLM-based quality filtering yields a
Parteo optimal efficiency tradeoff between data quantity and
model quality, with important implications for training cost,
self-improvement, and LLM training data curation.

How to Train Data-Efficient LLMs
Impact Statement
While increased LLM accessibility has well-documented
risks, we expect data-efficient pre-training to be a net social
good that reduces (amortized) carbon emissions and pre-
training cost while improving quality.

How to Train Data-Efficient LLMs
A. Algorithms
A.1. ASK-LLM Sampling
Algorithm 1 ASK-LLM Sampling
1: Input: Dataset D = {x1, x2, · · · , xN} s.t. xi ∈X is the training sample in plain-text, sample size k, scoring model
M : X; X 7→R
2: Initialize list of scores S = [].
3: for n = 1 →N do
4:
promptn ←make_prompt(xn)
// Make AS K-LLM prompts as in Figure 3
5:
Append M(“yes” | promptn) to S
// Use M to score xn
6: end for
7: Output: Select k elements from D with top-k scores in S, without replacement.
Discussion on the cost of ASK-LLM scoring. Even though ASK-LLM sampling results in impressive performance and
training efficiency improvements compared to training on the full-dataset (Appendix D), the data quality scoring cost might
seem prohibitive. On the other hand, on top of the improved results, we argue the following to be compelling points in
justifying ASK-LLM’s one-time-amortized data scoring cost:
• ASK-LLM only requires forward passes on the entire dataset. This is much cheaper than (i) training the model itself which
requires both forward and backward passes on multiple repetitions of the entire dataset, (ii) gradient-based data-curation
techniques (Sachdeva & McAuley, 2023; Sachdeva et al., 2023) that also require backward passes, etc.
• An additional benefit of the ASK-LLM framework is the ability to leverage memory-efficient, quantized LLM inference
setups (Dettmers et al., 2022). This is strictly not possible, e.g., for pre-training LLMs. Notably, quantization isn’t the only
ASK-LLM-friendly technique. All the recent (and future) advances in efficient inference techniques for LLMs (Weng,
2023) directly reduce the amortization cost of the ASK-LLM framework.
• Another benefit of ASK-LLM is the ability to naïvely parallelize quality scoring. To be more specific, we can simply scale-
up the amount of small & independent inference resources, and run inference calls for various training samples parallely.
Note that inference hardware has much smaller requirements compared to, e.g., pre-training or fine-tuning requirements.
This is primarily true because of no batch size requirement for inference vs. large batch size requirement while training.
This enables scaling-up hardware to happen via a large number of small-compute setups (e.g., 4 interconnected GPUs per
node) versus increasing the number of large-compute setups (e.g., 1000s of interconnected GPUs per node).
• ASK-LLM also uses strictly less compute compared to teacher-student knowledge distillation based training setups
(Agarwal et al., 2023). This is true simply because knowledge distillation require (i) bigger teacher model’s softmax
predictions (ii) for each token in our training data. On the other hand, ASK-LLM requires just the score of the token
“yes” given the prompt.
A.2. DENSITY Sampling
Our density sampler is adapted from that of Coleman et al. (2022), with a few critical departures:
• We use a two-pass procedure that allows for more rigorous theoretical guarantees (and different sampling behavior).
• We conduct the density estimation in the model’s latent space rather than using Jaccard similarity over n-grams.
Improvements: Jaccard similarities are sufficient to construct a reasonable sampling distribution for genomics applications,
which are significantly more structured than natural language. However, this is not the case with text — we found that
sampling based on Jaccard density is no better than random. For this reason, we must use different kernels (p-stable rather
than MinHash) and different input representations (embedding rather than n-grams).
However, our more interesting departure from Coleman et al. (2022) is our two-pass sampling procedure, which changes
the behavior of the algorithm and allows for more rigorous theoretical guarantees. The original method was only able to

How to Train Data-Efficient LLMs
demonstrate convergence of cluster populations in the sampled dataset. While this leads to (weak) convergence for some
measures of diversity, it also requires strong assumptions about the cluster structure.
Theory: We use a recent result that demonstrates consistent sketch-based estimation of the kernel sum (Theorem 3.3 of Liu
et al. (2023)), which we paraphrase below.
Lemma A.1. Let P(x) denote a probability density function. Let D ∼
iid P(x) denote a dataset. Let k(x, y) be a positive
definite LSH kernel, and let S be the DENSITY score. Then S(x) is a consistent estimator for the kernel sum.
S(x) →
i.p.
1
N
X
xi∈D
k(xi, q)
with convergence rate O(
p
log R/R).
If we perform inverse propensity sampling using the score in Lemma A.1, we obtain a sampling procedure that outputs a
uniformly-distributed sample.
Theorem A.2. Let Q(x) be the distribution formed by (i) drawing N samples i.i.d. from a distribution P, e.g. D =
{x1, ...xN} ∼P, and (ii) keeping x with probability proportional to
1
S(x). Under the conditions of Lemma A.1, Q(x) →
i.p.
U(x), where U(x) is the uniform distribution.
Proof. Under the conditions of Wied & Weißbach (2012) (specifically, positive-definiteness and ℓ1 integrability / bounded
domain), the kernel sum is a consistent estimator of the density. That is, the sum converges in probability to P(x).
1
N
X
xi∈D
k(xi, q) →
i.p. P(x)
Lemma A.1 shows that S(x) converges in probability to the sum (and thus to P(x)). By Slutsky’s Theorem,
1
S(x) →
1
P (x)
for all x in the support of the distribution (i.e. P(x)̸ = 0). The probability of generating x as part of the sample is:
Q(x) = Pr[Selectx ∩Generatex] = Pr[Selectx]Pr[Generatex] =
1
S(x)P(x)
Because
1
S(x) →
c
P (x) for some constant c, we have that Q(x) →c.
Theorem A.2 demonstrates that our DENSITY sampler outputs a uniformly-distributed collection of points over the input
space (latent LLM representation space).
Algorithm 2 Inverse Propensity Sampling (IPS) via Kernel Density Estimation (KDE)
1: Input: Dataset D = {x1, x2, · · · , xN} of embedings, sample size k, kernel k with corresponding locality-sensitive
hash family H (see Coleman & Shrivastava (2020)), hash range B, rows R, random seed s
2: Initialize: KDE sketch S ←0R×B
3: Generate R independent hash functions h1, . . . , hR from H with range B and random seed s.
4: for n = 1 →N do
// Construct KDE estimator for D.
5:
for r = 1 →R do
// Add xn to the KDE estimator.
6:
Sr,hr(xn)+ = 1
7:
end for
8: end for
9: Initialize list of scores S = [].
10: for n = 1 →N do
// Score each example xn
11:
score = 0
12:
for r = 1 →R do
// Compute approximate KDE using S
13:
score+ = S[r, hr(xn)]
14:
end for
15:
Append score/R to S

Figure 8. We consider a setup where all of our models are trained on exactly 524B tokens, causing us to repeat the same examples for
more epochs when we downsample. We borrow the format of this graphic explanation from Muennighoff et al. (2023), who consider a
similar setting.
Cost: Like SemDeDup, D4, and SSL prototypes, our DENSITY sampler requires access to embeddings for each example
in the training corpus. However, by eliminating the expensive clustering step, we eliminate a significant computational
overhead. Our DENSITY sampling routine required just 80MB of memory and two linear passes through the dataset to score
all 364M embeddings. This is significantly less expensive than clustering.
Tuning: We also eliminate a large number of hyperparameters, improving tuning. Cluster-based samplers must choose the
number of clusters, clustering optimizer and objective, and per-cluster sampling rate or deduplication similarity. Kernel
density estimation, on the other hand, has just two hyperparameters: the choice of kernel and the bandwidth. We did not
observe a significant performance variation among different bandwidth and kernel choices (e.g., the L2 and cosine kernels
of Coleman & Shrivastava (2020) perform nearly identically). This is likely because all positive-definite kernels enjoy
strong guarantees on the distribution approximation error (Devroye, 1983).
B. Data-curation Techniques
B.1. Random Sampling
The de-facto standard for obtaining samples of large datasets where we sample training examples uniformly at random.
Notably, random sampling has also been accompanied with strong results in a variety of applications in the data-curation
literature primarily due to its unbiased sampling (Ayed & Hayou, 2023b; Guo et al., 2022b).
B.2. DENSITY Sampling
See Section 3.2 for technical details about the DENSITY sampler. We use Sentence-T5-Base (Ni et al., 2021) as our
embedding model for training samples, primarily due to its contrastive training, giving confidence for computing distances
amongst its 768-dim embeddings. We use the PStable hash (Datar et al., 2004) to hash the embeddings, along with a
[1, 000 × 20, 000] sketch matrix.
B.3. SemDeDup
The key idea is to perform (coverage maximizing) semantic deduplication inside clusters of the original dataset (Abbas
et al., 2023). We re-use the Sentence-T5-Base embeddings of data-points (Appendix B.2), and perform k-means clustering
to obtain 10, 000 clusters of the entire dataset.

B.4. SSL Prototypes
They key idea is to remove prototypical points in a dataset (Sorscher et al., 2022). As a meaningful proxy, this method
removes the points closest to cluster centroids of a dataset. For brevity, we use the name “Prototypes” when reporting our
results. We re-use the same embeddings and clustering for both SemDeDup and Prototypes.
B.5. Perplexity Filtering
A popular quality-filtering approach in the literature is to use the perplexity of proxy language models to filter data-points
with a high-perplexity under that language model. While the literature historically used small language models for perplexity
filtering (Wenzek et al., 2019; Muennighoff et al., 2023), recent work (Marion et al., 2023) suggests improved filtering
performance when using LLMs for this task. To this end, we employ perplexity filtering with T5-{Small, Base, Large, XL,
XXL} models; as well as intermediate checkpoints during the course of training T5-Large: {20k, 100k, 300k, 500k, 700k}.
B.6. ASK-LLM Sampling
See Section 3.1 for technical details about the ASK-LLM sampler. Since ASK-LLM relies on the reasoning capabilities of
instruction-tuned models, we use the Flan-T5-{Small, Base, Large, XL, XXL} (Longpre et al., 2023a) models for obtaining
the quality scores in ASK-LLM.
C. Downstream Evaluation Tasks
C.1. Perplexity
Defined as the exponentiated average negative log-likelihood of an average sequence in the dataset; we compute the
perplexity over the default validation set in C4. Note that C4’s validation set is a random sample of the dataset, so it is prone
to be of much lower quality than curated sources, and hence, a less reliable indicator of true model quality.
C.2. HQ Perplexity
As our best effort to devise an inexpensive-to-compute metric that is better aligned with model quality than perplexity on
C4’s validation set, inspired by the evaluation conducted in Tirumala et al. (2023), we construct a high-quality validation set
from non web-scrape sources. We collate the validation sets from (1) English portion of wiki40b (Guo et al., 2020), (2)
realnews and webtext subsets of C4, and (3) news commentary from the LM1B dataset (Chelba et al., 2013).
C.3. GLUE
A popular natural language understanding meta-benchmark comprising of eleven different tasks (Wang et al., 2018). Note
that we report the average score for all individual tasks, after finetuning on the concatenation of all individual tasks’ training
sets, as is done in the original T5 implementation.
C.4. SuperGLUE
A harder meta-benchmark (vs. GLUE) built to further test the natural language understanding abilities of language models
(Wang et al., 2019). Similar to GLUE, we report the average score of all tasks, and conduct fine-tuning on all tasks’
concatenated train-set.
C.5. CNN/DM
We use the CNN/DM dataset (Hermann et al., 2015) for testing our models’ abstractive summarization abilities. Like the T5
original setting, we finetune on the train-set, and report the ROUGE-2 scores.
C.6. SQuAD
A popular dataset (Rajpurkar et al., 2016) used to evaluate question-answering capabilities of language models, we compare
the finetuned performance of our models using exact-match as the metric.

C.7. FLAN Instruction Tuning
A popular application of LLMs has been instruction-following, and chatting capabilities. To test our model’s quality on
this front, we finetune our models on the FLANv2 dataset (Longpre et al., 2023a), and test the instruction-tuned models’
performance from four fronts:
• 5-shot MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2020): a popular benchmark consiting of exam questions from 57 tasks.
• 3-shot Big Bench Hard (BBH) (Srivastava et al., 2022): a popular set of 23 hardest tasks from big bench.
• Reasoning: macro-average 8-shot performance on GSM8k (Cobbe et al., 2021), SVAMP (Patel et al., 2021), ASDIV
(Miao et al., 2021), and StrategyQA (Geva et al., 2021) benchmarks.
• QA: macro-average 0-shot performance on UnifiedQA (Khashabi et al., 2020), BoolQ (Clark et al., 2019), Arc-Easy and
Arc-Challenge (Clark et al., 2018) benchmarks.
• Average: macro-average of all the four benchmarking suites listed above: MMLU, BBH, Reasoning, and Q/A.
Please note that all of our reported numbers are based on single checkpoint evaluations, i.e., we first select the best checkpoint
during FLAN finetuning using the average performance on all tasks, and report the individual task performance on that
checkpoint.
D. Additional Results
D.1. (Figure 9) Quality-score Distribution for Different Samplers
For different data curation techniques listed in Appendix B, we examine the distribution of estimated data-quality scores
normalized in a way that higher represents better data quality.
• For the DENSITY sampler, the plotted score is proportional to the likelihood of the example under the kernel density
estimate.
• For the Prototypes sampler, the plotted score represents the negated cosine similarity of data-point with its assigned cluster
centroid.
• For the SemDeDup sampler, the plotted score represents the negated maximum cosine similarity of a datapoint to all other
datapoints in its respective cluster.
• For the perplexity filtering sampler, the plotted score represents the negated perplexity of a training sample.
• For the ASK-LLM sampler, the plotted score represents the log probability of the token “yes” given the prompt in
Figure 3.

converged pre-training run over a sampled dataset. See Appendix C for a description about the metrics used in this plot.
D.3. (Figures 17 to 23) Quality of Fresh vs. Repeated Tokens for Different Samplers
We investigate the data-efficiency for different data curation techniques listed in Appendix B over various downstream
evaluations listed in Appendix C, when stratifying by the maximum number of repetitions allowed over the sampled dataset.
We plot our results in the following figures:
• (Figure 17) T5-Small, coverage: Average data-efficiency of pre-training T5-Small on data sampled by {Random sampling,
DENSITY sampling, Self-supervised Prototypes sampling, SemDeDup}, stratified by the maxmimum number of allowed
repetitions over the sampled dataset.
• (Figure 18) T5-Large, coverage: Average data-efficiency of pre-training T5-Large on data sampled by {Random sampling,
DENSITY sampling, Self-supervised Prototypes sampling, SemDeDup}, stratified by the maxmimum number of allowed

Figure 30. Data efficiency comparison of different samplers while training T5-Large for various sampling ratios. Each point in this plot is
the performance of an intermediate checkpoint during the course of training on sampled data.
E. Qualitative Results
In this section we look at some qualitative training samples, sorted according to various criteria of data-quality scores.
Along with the textual content of each training sample, we also list the estimated data-quality percentile for ASK-LLM and
perplexity filtering samplers, i.e., the percentile of the given data-point’s quality score amongst the entire training set. A
high percentile represents that the sampler estimates this training sample to have higher quality compared to other training
samples in the dataset. We manually don’t include any NSFW examples to the best of our knowledge.
E.1. High-quality Samples Identified by ASK-LLM
We look at the training samples that all ASK-LLM scoring models, on average, think are good (i.e., have a high percentile).
To the best of our understanding, the overarching conclusions we make by observing these qualitative samples are:
• ASK-LLM doesn’t seem to have any length bias for good examples.
• ASK-LLM can accurately tag high-quality training samples that contain a lot of proper nouns and named entities.
Perplexity filtering gets these kind of samples wrong.
• Even looking at this slice of only the highest-quality data tagged by ASK-LLM, perplexity filtering scores don’t seem to
correlate well with ASK-LLM scores as suggested by Figure 7.

Viva La Vegan! - Can a Vegan Lifestyle Help to Get Rid of Ocean Dead Zones? Can a Vegan Lifestyle Help to Get
Rid of Ocean Dead Zones? A dead zone is an area at the bottom of the ocean that is oxygen depleted and cannot
maintain any marine life. The biggest cause of these dead zones is an overflow of fertilizers, sewage and industrial
pollutants being pumped into rivers all over the world. Thankfully dead zones can be reversed and living a vegan
lifestyle can help enormously and I’ll show you how. What are Ocean Dead Zones?
......
Vegans don’t want to harm the planet. On the contrary they want to save it and what better way than living with
nature instead of against it and helping the planet in ways we probably never even realised, like helping to reverse
our oceans dead zones. Next time you think about buying something you don’t need, or eating food that is highly
processed or non-organic, spare a thought for the largely unknown dead zones and how overconsumption and an
unnatural lifestyle is slowly killing both you and them.

Question: Is it necessary to dredge ponds and lakes in the upper coastal region of South Carolina? Answer: It is
necessary to dredge ponds and lakes in South Carolina, in the upper coastal region of South Carolina. Each lake and
each pond is a different environment and as years pass, these environments accumulate a lot of sediment. They tend
to fill in with storm water runoff, they tend from natural leafy materials—whether it be grass clippings, leafy
materials, storm water fun off, sand, silt, sediment, muck, mire. All of these produce in the bottoms of pond beds
and lake beds. So it is absolutely necessary to do an evaluation every so many years to determine whether or not you
need to remove the sediment that’s accumulated.

However, it’s a long and challenging way to mass production. New Tesla Model 3 is an electric game-changer worth
$35,000 and comes in classic black color. A single masterpiece in black now belongs to Tesla’s CEO and co-founder
Elon Musk. Why not mass market yet? Company has a quite complicated reason. Tesla needs to make sure that it
can build, deliver and service enormous numbers of these awesome electric cars without sacrificing quality. Tesla
will present 30 first cars at a launch celebration dated on July 28. 100 cars with production speed 3 cars per day
dated for August. 1,500 cars will be ready for September.
...
Owners of new Teslas will also enjoy exquisite aerodynamic wheel face. An itemized list of the Tesla Model 3’s
features, specs, and pricing is expected to be revealed on July 28, at the car’s launch party. 5.6 seconds is what it gets
the Model 3 to go from zero to 60 miles per hour, as May news says. Hot, right? It accelerates even faster than the
base model BMW 3 Series or the famous Mercedes-Benz C Class, which are leaders in the compact luxury space. A
single charge will allow minimum 215 miles of single drive. The roof in Model 3 is made almost entirely of glass,
providing an incredible sense of space and infinity. Moreover, it blocks UV rays and manages the level of heat.

Landmines. Every month, 1200 people are maimed, and a further 800 killed throughout the world due to landmines.
Landmine removal efforts are clearing about 100,000 mines a year, but at rate it will still be over 1000 years to get
them all. The cost of clearing them is huge, with estimates in excess of $50 billion. Worse still, for every 5000
mines cleared, one person will die in the process.
...
Hopefully the work that people like Vandiver and Tan can be built upon and further progress can be made in the
fight to clear the world of landmines. The video below shows a group of minesweepers working with the kits- and it
is clear even watching them that the level of understanding as to how the mine operates is already improving- giving
them the knowledge they need to safely diffuse any mines they encounter.

By all measures a successful chemical engineering undergraduate at Oregon Agricultural College, and wanting very
much to continue his education and earn his PhD in chemistry, Linus Pauling wrote to several graduate programs
across the country, inquiring in particular about fellowships. Though he had proven himself to be prodigious talent
as a student and, already, as a teacher, Pauling’s location in Corvallis didn’t carry a great deal of cache with the
country’s elite institutions. And given his family’s shaky financial health, some measure of institutional funding was
going to be required if he were to advance in the academy.
...
During his sparse free time, Pauling wrote letter after letter to his girlfriend, Ava Helen Miller, who remained in
Corvallis to continue work on her Home Economics degree at OAC. Having expressed a desire to marry at least
twice before Linus left for California, only to be rebuffed by their families, the two decided in their letters that they
would absolutely be wed once Pauling had finished his first year of classes and just prior to his resumption of more
construction work during the summer. Their plan came to fruition in Salem, Oregon on June 17, 1923, and Ava
Helen moved to Pasadena that fall to accompany her new husband during his second year as a graduate student.

"What is your number one secret to productivity?" In recording their responses, Kruse came across some fascinating
suggestions. What follows are some of my favorites. They focus on minutes, not hours. Most people default to hour
and half-hour blocks on their calendar; highly successful people know that there are 1,440 minutes in every day and
that there is nothing more valuable than time. Money can be lost and made again, but time spent can never be
reclaimed. As legendary Olympic gymnast Shannon Miller told Kevin, "To this day, I keep a schedule that is almost
minute by minute." You must master your minutes to master your life.
...
Energy is everything. You can’t make more minutes in the day, but you can increase your energy to increase your
attention, focus, and productivity. Highly successful people don’t skip meals, sleep, or breaks in the pursuit of more,
more, more. Instead, they view food as fuel, sleep as recovery, and breaks as opportunities to recharge in order to
get even more done. Author of #1 bestselling book, Emotional Intelligence 2.0, and president of TalentSmart,

E.2. Low-quality Samples Identified by ASK-LLM
We look at the training samples that all ASK-LLM scoring models, on average, think are bad (i.e., have a low percentile).
To the best of our understanding, the overarching conclusions we make by observing these qualitative samples are:
• ASK-LLM doesn’t seem to have any length bias for bad examples.
• ASK-LLM filters hateful or toxic examples that might hurt LLM training.
• ASK-LLM rejects non-contextual samples, e.g., having only questions with no answers, repeated non-sensical content,
etc. Notably, perplexity filtering performs bad in these cases, as these low quality examples tend to have a low perplexity
score.

10 February 2019 I have 2 houses (joint - me & my wife) in my name and 2 land (plots). Recently sold one of flat
(100% cheque payment). Can I reinvest the Capital gains arriving out of sale in purchasing a flat? Note: I had
reinvested earlier on (4 years ago) the similar captial gains to buy land from a house sale.
E.3. Increasing-quality Samples Identified by ASK-LLM
We look at the training samples that ASK-LLM scoring models disagree on as we go from Flan-T5-Small →Flan-T5-XXL.
Specifically, we look at training samples that Flan-T5-Small thinks are of low quality, whereas Flan-T5-XXL thinks
otherwise. To the best of our understanding, our overarching conclusions by observing these qualitative samples are:
• Larger scoring models in ASK-LLM are able to identify training samples containing tail-end of knowledge, e.g., rare
world-events, rare named entities, etc.
• The increasing quality trend going from Flan-T5-Small →Flan-T5-XXL isn’t correlated with the quality scoring model
size in perplexity filtering.

The historic city of Manchester now features one of the most interesting public art installations that art lovers have
ever witnessed. Design studio, Acrylicize installed five giant lamps in Piccadilly Place that represent the many
historic periods that the city has gone through, including; Art Deco, Art Nouveau, Victorian, mid-century, and
contemporary. The installation is without any doubt, a great piece of art but unlike other artworks, these are
absolutely functional as well. Each lamp provides the many visitors with seating, shelter, light and even heat in the
winters. The admirers can also witness the historic stories of Manchester via graphic illustrations on the lamps.

The Cokin Yellow and Pink Center Spot filter has a clear center and diffused yellow and pink edges. Theses diffused
edges will be produce blur while leaving the center sharp. The filter effect is directly influenced by the f-stop and
the focal length. A lens shot at f/1.4 will see a greater blurring effect than f/8.0 and a 85mm lens will see more blur
than a 28mm. Additionally, a longer focal length lens will visually increase the size of the center spot area because
it sees less of the filter area.

Provide hoist coverage and 200 degree rotation for individual use in bays, along walls, or columns of plants, or as a
supplement to an overhead crane or monorail system. This jib has the advantage of providing maximum lift for the
hoist, since it can be installed very close to the underside of the lowest ceiling obstruction. It is composed of a
vertical mast mounted to 2 brackets on a wall or vertical building beam with a boom that cantilevers out,
perpendicular from the wall at the top.

Anderson .Paak’s new album, Oxnard, is a nod to the Southern California city where Anderson grew up. It is the
Grammy-nominated artist’s third studio album and the first to be released on Dr. Dre’s label Aftermath
Entertainment. Oxnard includes his latest single, Tints featuring Kendrick Lamar along with album features from J
Cole, Pusha T and many more. This is the album he dreamed of making in high school, when he was listening to
Jay-Z’s The Blueprint, The Game’s The Documentary, and Kanye West’s The College Dropout. The classic fourth
album from the rap-god Eminem.

The Disknet is a networking solution which uses the external floppy drive port of the Amiga. It uses the same coax
cabling as 10Base2 Ethernet (RG-58U/50Ohm) but is NOT compatible and is capable of transferring at around
45k/sec. The Disknet may be the same device as the AmigaLink, but this has not been confirmed.
E.4. Decreasing-quality Samples Identified by ASK-LLM
We look at the training samples that ASK-LLM scoring models disagree on as we go from Flan-T5-Small →Flan-T5-XXL.
Specifically, we look at training samples that Flan-T5-XXL thinks are of low quality, whereas Flan-T5-Small thinks
otherwise. To the best of our understanding, our overarching conclusions by observing these qualitative samples are:
• Smaller quality-scoring models sometimes mislabel non-informative training samples, that contain, e.g., non-informative
content, or repeated content.
• The decreasing quality trend going from Flan-T5-Small →Flan-T5-XXL isn’t correlated with the quality scoring model
size in perplexity filtering.

A brilliant performance by Year 6 based on The Lion King. Brilliant singing and acting from everyone,
congratulations Year 6! A big thank you to all the staff that helped with everything from costumes, set design, make
up and directing. A wonderful commemoration of the seven years that Year 6 students have spent at The Good
Shepherd. Thank you to all of the parents and staff for attending this celebration and we wish all of the children
continued success in their new schools and hope they continue to do themselves proud. Well done to Foundation for
showing us what it is to be good friends! This week we have been looking at all the countries in the world that speak
Spanish as their native language, there are 21! So throughout school we spent a day learning lots of wonderful
things about our chosen country. We looked at maps, flags, famous people, food and so much more! Below is a little
glimpse into our fabulous week.

Click on the links to take a look at some of the brilliant things we got up to! Faith in Families is a charity based here
in Nottingham who believe, as we do, that all children have the right to grow up as part of a loving and nurturing
family and they provide services for children and families. We learnt lots about adoption and what it can mean for
children and their family. We learnt about Fairtrade and all the fantastic work they do around the world. We also
discovered lots of products that we did not know were Fairtrade. There was also a sell out Fairtrade food sale, well
done everyone! Year 2 have been able to show off our brilliant new high visibility jackets! Now we will be able to
stay safe and visible on any out of school trips. We are very lucky to have these donated by Walton & Allen. Thank
you! Click on the high visibility jacket to take a look at our super jackets! Year 4 have wowed us with their acting
