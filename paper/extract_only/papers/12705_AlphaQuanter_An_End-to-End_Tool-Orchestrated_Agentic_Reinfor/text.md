### Abstract

While Large Language Model (LLM) agents show promise in automated trading, they still face critical limitations. Prominent multi-agent frameworks often suffer from inefficiency, produce inconsistent signals, and lack the end-toend optimization required to learn a coherent strategy from market feedback. To address this, we introduce AlphaQuanter, a single-agent framework that uses reinforcement learning (RL) to learn a dynamic policy over a transparent, tool-augmented decision workflow, which empowers a single agent to autonomously orchestrate tools and proactively acquire information on demand, establishing a transparent reasoning process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AlphaQuanter achieves state-of-theart performance on key financial metrics. Besides, human evaluation shows the learned reasoning patterns reveal more faithful and coherent tool-usage behaviors, providing steps toward verifiable LLM-driven trading. Our code and data can be found at https://github.

### 1 Introduction

The exploration of automated trading systems in modern financial markets is flourishing. Traditional machine learning methods (such as SVM, Random Forests, etc.) (Rumelhart et al., 1986; Cortes and Vapnik, 1995; Breiman, 2001) typically simplify the problem into discrete predictions of price direction at the next moment, making it difficult to effectively integrate multi-source heterogeneous trading signals. Although Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) can directly optimize decisions around longterm portfolio returns (Moody and Saffell, 1998; Wang et al., 2021), its black-box nature leads to trading decisions that are difficult to trace back to concrete evidence. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated tremendous potential in the field of financial trading (Xiao et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2024a; Wang et al., 2023).

However, existing LLM-based attempts still face critical challenges. (1) First, the lack of tool orchestration and active information acquisition capabilities makes it difficult for models to autonomously invoke and sequentially utilize external tools during the reasoning process, identify information gaps, and fill them on demand. (2) Second, evidencegrounded decision traces are insufficient; current training paradigms are mostly black-box end-toend optimization or offline answer fitting, lacking a decision trajectory that can be consistently grounded in tool outputs and inspected step by step, making it difficult to establish user trust and support regulatory audits. (3) Last but not least, prompt-based methods exhibit poor robustness, are extremely sensitive to prompt engineering; meanwhile, multi-agent debate pipelines are often costly and redundant, and can further suffer from low decision efficiency, system fragility, and signal inconsistency. Overall, conducting reasoning under partially observable conditions, integrating heterogeneous signals, and executing actions with calibrated confidence remain core challenges that urgently need to be addressed.

To address these gaps, we propose AlphaQuanter, a single agent trading framework designed to enable informative, evidence-grounded and robust trading decisions. First, AlphaQuanter unifies the workflows into one ReAct-like agent (Yao et al., 2023) tailored for trading-oriented planning and reasoning. We define several tools for various information sources and our framework starts from a guided plan followed by iterative tool use and information seeking as well as in-depth analysis. Second, to further enhance decision-making capabilities and promote faithful tool use with verifiable evidence, we leverage reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (Guo et al., 2025; Lambert et al., 2024) to end-to-end optimize models that can selectively invoke useful tools and effectively gather supporting evidence. We further curate high-

quality outcome- and process-based reward signals to guide RL training across diverse actions. This design eliminates the need for extensive prompt engineering across multiple agents, while producing a more traceable decision trajectory and ensuring stable and efficient decision-making in practice. Finally, we evaluate our framework through backtesting protocols and human evaluation. Our key contributions are summarized as follows:

- • We propose a novel single-agent framework with effective reasoning chains that ensure both decision consistency and traceable tool-use trajectories grounded in external evidence.
- • We design an end-to-end RL approach that trains the agent to actively acquire useful information and select supporting evidence for in-depth analysis. It directly optimizes the entire decisionmaking process for long-term profitability.
- • Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that AlphaQuanter not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on key financial metrics but also improves decision-trace faithfulness, exhibiting coherent, evidence-grounded decision patterns that can be analyzed by human experts.

### 2 Related Work

Early approaches use traditional machine learning methods, such as SVM and random forest, to frame the task as a simple price direction classification (Rumelhart et al., 1986; Cortes and Vapnik, 1995; Breiman, 2001), which has been proven insufficient due to oversimplification and poor generalization in trading environments (Zhong, 2025).

Deep Reinforcement Learning Moody and Saffell (1998) pioneered the application of deep reinforcement learning to stock trading, directly optimizing trading performance end-to-end and outperforming supervised learning in long-horizon S&P 500 backtests. iRDPG (Liu et al., 2020b) integrates imitation learning under a partially observable Markov decision process framework, using expert behavior to stabilize the training process and improve robustness, but overly relies on existing strategies. DeepTrader (Wang et al., 2021) introduces macro states and risk-sensitive rewards, achieving dynamic adjustment of long-short positions and risk control. MTS (Gu et al., 2025) improves returns across multiple datasets through time-aware encoding, parallel short selling, and CVaR-based risk management. However, these

methods belong to end-to-end black-box optimization, lacking necessary interpretability, and cannot integrate external signals such as news and fundamentals on demand.

LLMs-Based Trading Agents FinMem (Yu et al., 2025) exemplifies single-agent LLM trading systems that use layered memory retrieval and an explicit reflect step to construct prompts from multi-horizon financial events. TradingAgents (Xiao et al., 2024) introduces a multi-agent framework where role-playing LLM agents debate to reach a trading decision, while FinAgent (Zhang et al., 2024a) further integrates multimodal information with tool-enhancement components, achieving competitive results across multiple evaluation metrics. However, these approaches lack explicit coordination and constraint mechanisms, making debate-style decision processes yield inconsistent or conflicting signals and high sensitivity to prompt design. Alpha-GPT (Wang et al., 2023) adopts a human-in-the-loop paradigm that enables factor mining through natural-language interaction, but it is difficult to autonomously scale and automate in high-frequency trading environments.

LLM-Based Reinforcement Learning Optimization Motivated by the recent success of DeepSeek-R1 (Guo et al., 2025), growing work explores RL approaches to optimize LLMs for quantitative trading. FLAG-Trader (Xiong et al., 2025) employs partially fine-tuned LLMs as policy networks, optimizing trading rewards through policy gradient methods. Trading-R1 (Xiao et al., 2025) constructs large-scale financial corpora and implements a three-stage curriculum learning framework that combines SFT with RL. However, both types of methods generally lack end-to-end simulation of real trading processes and autonomous exploration capabilities and have not yet endowed models with spontaneous perception of information gaps or proactive orchestration of external tools.

### 3 Problem Definition

To navigate a partially observable market within a single trading day, we model the agent’s task as a tool-augmented Markov Decision Process (MDP), defined by the tuple ⟨S,A,T ,R⟩. The central challenge within this framework is to learn a strategy that sequences tool use and the final action to maximize return.

- Figure 1: The overall architecture and workflow of AlphaQuanter. The central panel shows the agent’s iterative rollout process. Starting from an initial state (S0), the agent first forms an initial plan (P0) before generating further reasoning traces (Ri+1) with <think> tag. In each step, it decides whether to continue acquiring information by executing a tool-based action (Ai+1) and receiving its environmental feedback (Ei+1), or to conclude by outputting a final decision with an <answer> tag. Throughout this process, the agent can query multi-dimensional financial data sources (bottom panel, Section 6.2). Once a decision is made, the entire trajectory will be evaluated to compute a reward (top-right panel, Section 4.2), which updates the agent’s policy. The overall workflow (top-left panel, Section 4.1) is designed to mimic a human trader’s cognitive process of reasoning and acquiring data on demand.

State Space S A state s ∈ S captures the agent’s accumulated information, represented as the tuple s = (initial_context,query_history,query_result), where initial_context includes basic metadata (e.g., stock symbol, date), query_history records the tools invoked so far, and query_result stores their corresponding outputs.

Reward Function R An episode yields a trajectory τ = (s0,a0,s1,a1,⋯,sT,aT), a sequence of states and actions beginning at the initial state s0 and terminating with the first decision action aT, where all intermediate actions a0,a1,⋯,aT−1 are query actions. The agent’s objective is to learn a policy π that maximizes the cumulative trajectory reward R(τ) = ∑Tt=0 R(st,at). The step-wise reward function R ∶ S × A → R is designed to promote strategic and profitable decision-making: rewarding BUY when the outlook is positive, SELL when negative, and HOLD when conditions are neutral or non-directional, while guiding tool use toward informative queries.

Action Space A The action space A comprises two distinct types. First, the agent can execute

ato queryactivelyactiongatherfrominformationAq = {fromf1,f2four,⋯,fsource∣Aq∣} categories (market data, fundamental indicators, sentiment analysis, and macroeconomic metrics), thereby updating its state. Detailed descriptions of the data sources are provided in Section 6.2. Finally, the agent can execute a decision action from Ad = {BUY,SELL,HOLD}, which terminates the decision-making process.

### 4 AlphaQuanter

4.1 Cognitive Workflow

Inspired by the ReAct paradigm (Yao et al., 2023), AlphaQuanter interleaves reasoning traces with discrete actions, as illustrated in Figure 1. The workflow begins with an initial Plan generation, followed by an iterative loop with three stages: (i) identify an information gap and Acquire new evidence via a tool call; (ii) Reason over the acquired evidence to update beliefs, and (iii) Act by either continuing the loop to gather more information or committing to a trading decision. This design en-

Transition Dynamics T The state transitions are deterministic. When the agent selects a query ac-

tion at ∈ Aq at time step t, the current state st transitions to st+1 by appending the query and its result to query_history and query_results, respectively. When the agent selects a decision action at ∈ Ad, the episode terminates immediately.

forces stepwise hypothesis testing while keeping evidence collection tightly coupled to reasoning. See Appendix B.1 for the full prompt design.

#### 4.2 Reward Formulation

Outcome Score To train a robust, forwardlooking agent under market noise, we encourage actions only on high-conviction signals, correctly classifying market states as strongly bullish, bearish, or neutral, while ignoring noise. We therefore smooth future returns by blending multiple horizons, akin to label smoothing (Szegedy et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2020a). Specifically, we define the exponentially weighted forward return rt to filter short-lived fluctuations and emphasize the medium-

- term trajectory: rt = ∑Hh=1 ωh⋅(pt+h+1/pt+1 − 1), where pt is the asset price on day t, H is the maxi-

mum horizon, ωh = ηh/∑Hi=1 ηi is the normalized exponential weight, and η ∈ (0,1) is the decay fac-

tor. Thresholding rt at θ yields the market regime, and we assign discrete rewards by action as specified in Table 1.

Future Market State at = BUY at = SELL at = HOLD

Highly Bullish (rt > θ) +1.0 -1.0 -0.75 Highly Bearish (rt < −θ) -1.0 +1.0 -0.75 Sideways (∣rt∣ ≤ θ) -0.5 -0.5 +1.0

Table 1: Discrete reward structure for Rresult.

We adopt an asymmetric penalty scheme to provide a more informative learning signal: taking the opposite side of a strong trend (reward −1.0) is penalized more than failing to act on an opportunity (reward −0.75), nudging the policy toward risk-aware behavior consistent with professional trading practice.

Process Score The process score comprises a format score Rformat and a tool score Rtool. The format score regulates the length of the reasoning trace: given a target token interval [mintoken,maxtoken], outputs outside this interval incur penalties, encouraging sufficiency without verbosity. The tool-use score governs acquisition efficiency by penalizing a total number of tool calls outside [mintool,maxtool]. It further discourages the degenerate collect-then-conclude pattern, acquiring all data in a single round and immediately producing a final answer, which can cause training to collapse. In addition, malformed tool calls that violate the function signature (e.g., missing or incorrect arguments) incur additional penalties. See Appendix B.2 for the process-score pseudocode.

In conclusion, we define the total reward R = αRresult + Rformat + Rtool, where the hyperparameter α places a greater emphasis on the outcome score, reflecting its primary importance.

### 5 Evaluation

#### 5.1 Backtesting Protocol

While the policy is optimized for day-to-day decisions, its ultimate value is determined by the strategy’s risk-adjusted performance over extended horizons (Markowitz, 1952). To evaluate this, we run backtests in which the daily-trained policy π is applied sequentially across a historical period, generating a series of trades from which we measure the resulting portfolio performance.

#### 5.2 Portfolio State and Transition Dynamics

We define the core variables of our portfolio in Table 2. The transition from the portfolio state (ht,ct) to the new state (ht+1,ct+1) is determined by the action at, as summarized in Table 3.

Symbol Description

pi Closing price of the asset on day i. hi Number of shares held at the end of day i. ci Cash balance at the end of day i. Vi Total portfolio value at the end of day i. (Vi = ci + hi ⋅ pi) λ Transaction fee rate for BUY/SELL orders. κ Capital utilization ratio for BUY orders (slippage buffer).

κct pt+1⌋ ct − (1 + λ) ⌊

κct pt+1⌋pt+1

SELL 0 ct + (1 − λ)ht pt+1 HOLD ht ct

Table 3: State transition rules for all actions.

#### 5.3 Evaluation Metrics

Following prior work (Zhang et al., 2024a; Qin et al., 2024; Xiong et al., 2025), we employ three widely used portfolio-level metrics as follows:

Annualized Rate of Return (ARR) measures profitability by annualizing total return:

ARR = (VT/V0)252/T − 1

where V0 and VT are initial and final portfolio values, T is trading days, 252 is annual trading days.

Sharpe Ratio (SR) measures risk-adjusted performance: SR = r¯/σr, where rt = (Vt − Vt−1)/Vt−1, r¯ = T1 ∑Tt=1 rt, and σr = √

T−1 ∑Tt=1(rt − r¯)2. Higher SR indicates better risk-adjusted returns.

1

Maximum DrawDown (MDD) measures the largest peak-to-trough decline:

1≤t≤T (

max1≤s≤t Vs − Vt max1≤s≤t Vs )

MDD = max

Lower MDD reflects better downside risk control.

### 6 Experimental Setup

#### 6.1 Dataset and Simulation Period

Following prior work (Zhang et al., 2024a; Yu et al., 2025; Xiong et al., 2025), we select a widely used set of large, liquid stocks with frequent news activity, enabling fair comparison across methods. We focus on five stocks: Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL); Microsoft Corporation (MSFT); Meta Platforms, Inc. (META); NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA); and Tesla, Inc. (TSLA). These firms are informationrich, providing rapidly evolving signals that stress iterative tool use and analysis. We split data chronologically into non-overlapping train/valid/test sets, as shown in Table 4. We also insert an approximately 30-trading-day gap between successive sets to prevent leakage and look-ahead bias.

Table 4: Dataset splits and trading-day counts.

#### 6.2 Information Sources

The tool integrates four primary data categories summarized below. See Appendix A for details.

Market Data Daily price data (e.g., OHLCV) for each stock, along with a curated set of technical indicators grouped by function: trend (e.g., SMA, EMA), momentum (e.g., RSI, STOCH), volatility (e.g., BBANDS), and volume (e.g., OBV). These support technical analysis of market dynamics.

Fundamental Data Financial data from corporate filings, including income statements, balance sheets, cash flow statements, insider trading activity, dividend history, and earnings estimates. These support the assessment of company intrinsic value.

Sentiment Data Textual signals from financial news and social media platforms (e.g., Alpha Vantage, Reddit) to quantify market sentiment and investor psychology. These signals capture shorthorizon sentiment and narrative shifts.

Macroeconomic Indicators Series capturing broad macroeconomic conditions and market-wide regimes, including inflation (e.g., CPI), interest rates (e.g., federal funds rate), and industry activity (e.g., commodity prices). These indicators provide the macroeconomic context for asset pricing.

#### 6.3 Implementation

Baselines We compare with seven categories of baselines: (1) Market: a passive buy and hold strategy; (2) Rule: classic technical trading rules, including MACD and ZMR (Zhang et al., 2024a); (3) RL: traditional deep RL baselines, including A2C and PPO, implemented in the FinRL framework (Liu et al., 2020a) ; (4) LM: language modeling-based forecasting methods, represented by Chronos-2 (Ansari et al., 2025); (5) LLM: LLM traders without RL optimization, including FinMem (Yu et al., 2025) and TradingAgents (Xiao et al., 2024); (6) Multi-Agent: the TradingAgents framework with different backbone LLMs: Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct, Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct (Yang et al., 2024), Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct (Yang et al., 2025), DeepSeek-V3.1 (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2024), Kimi-K2 (Bai et al., 2025), GPT-4o-mini, and GPT4o (Hurst et al., 2024); (7) Single-Agent: an ablated AlphaQuanter that keeps the same tool access and prompting structure without RL training.

Training Details We train the AlphaQuanter agents using Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct and Qwen2.57B-Instruct (Yang et al., 2024) as backbones, with the verl framework (Sheng et al., 2025), optimizing the policy with the GRPO algorithm (Shao et al., 2024). At the inference time, we use deterministic decoding (temperature = 0). For each configuration, we report the mean performance over three independent runs (distinct random seeds) to mitigate variance. All experiments are conducted on NVIDIA A100 GPUs (80GB). See Appendix B for detailed hyperparameters and training settings.

show that, except for GPT-4o, the single-agent framework consistently outperforms the multiagent framework on key metrics, particularly ARR. This supports our hypothesis that, for smaller-scale models, multi-agent debate can inject noise or amplify hallucinations rather than yield complementary insights, ultimately degrading performance. These results provide clear justification for adopting a single-agent architecture in our approach.

RQ2: Is prompt-based reasoning sufficient for trading decisions? We compare the strongest prompt-based baselines against the simple buy-andhold strategy. On average, all backbones except GPT-4o fail to beat the market method. We attribute the underperformance to difficulty learning actionable decision boundaries. Although the models can infer bullish or bearish sentiment, the promptbased baseline does not reliably calibrate the decision threshold at which a signal should trigger BUY rather than HOLD. This exposes a fundamental limitation of current small-scale LLMs for trading and indicates that prompt-only reasoning is insufficient; agents should be explicitly trained to map high-dimensional market states to optimal trading actions.

RQ3: How effective is the AlphaQuanter? We compare the fully trained AlphaQuanter against all baselines. Both the 3B and 7B variants significantly outperform the strongest baseline, with absolute ARR gains of 6.54% and 18.45%, respectively. Notably, AlphaQuanter also surpasses deep RL agents that operate on numerical features and LLM baselines that directly ingest all available financial signals, highlighting the benefit of training a tool-using policy rather than a feature-only controller. Moreover, the 7B model is notably consistent, outperforming all baselines on three of the five stocks, showing that end-to-end RL training enables small LLMs to learn robust trading policies, including proactive tool use and information seeking, that even surpass powerful zero-shot setting such as GPT-4o. In short, the evidence indicates that specialized training paradigms may be more critical than model scale for achieving state-of-theart performance in automated trading systems.

ing reward signals and behavioral patterns during learning; and (2) validation performance (Figure 3), evaluating trading performance on unseen data. This joint analysis reveals how the agents’ evolving behaviors translate into practical outcomes.

Training Dynamics The upward reward trajectory demonstrates effective learning from market interactions. Interpreting the behavioral metrics in Figure 2, response length is cumulative tokens per episode and turns count total user+assistant messages; these metrics reveal markedly different learning dynamics between the two models. Both exhibit an initial volatile exploration phase, but their subsequent paths differ substantially. The

- 3B model transitions into a simplistic exploitation phase characterized by fewer tool calls and decreasing response length, suggesting premature convergence to a less robust policy. In contrast, the

- 7B model achieves stable exploitation around step 200 and subsequently enters a policy refinement phase, evidenced by increased response length and dialogue turns. This pattern indicates that the larger model explores more sophisticated reasoning chains and information-seeking strategies to extract marginal performance gains.

Validation Performance The validation metrics confirm the successful generalization of the learned policies to unseen data. For both 3B and 7B, ARR and SR exhibit clear upward trends that closely mirror the training reward curves. Notably, the 7B model shows a downward trend in MDD, indicating it has learned not only to maximize returns but also to effectively manage downside risk. Conversely, the 3B model’s MDD oscillates with an upward

bias, revealing its failure to internalize risk-aware trading behavior despite improving returns.

Efficiency Beyond performance, we assess inference cost by measuring the average number of LLM-generated tokens per trading decision, aggregated over all trading days across the five datasets. Table 6 compares the multi-agent baseline (MA), a prompt-only single-agent (SA), and AlphaQuanter (SA+RL). The prompt-only single-agent is the most token-efficient, but its ARR is not the highest. AlphaQuanter achieves the best ARR while maintaining low token usage, corresponding to only 0.15× the cost of the multi-agent baseline.

#### 7.3 Faithfulness Analysis

To quantify faithfulness of tool-augmented decision traces, we use three human-rated metrics: (1) Alignment (whether stated information needs match executed tool calls), (2) Evidence Grounding (whether key decision claims are supported by tool outputs), and (3) Conciseness (whether the trace avoids redundant tool calls). We randomly sample 50 inputs and collect outputs from three methods (MA/SA/SA+RL). Three Ph.D. raters independently score each output on a 0 − 2 scale for all metrics, and we assess inter-rater reliability using Krippendorff’s α (Hayes and Krippendorff, 2007) for ordinal ratings (α = 0.78). We report the averaged results in Table 7. Overall, SA+RL (AlphaQuanter) achieves the best performance across all three metrics. In contrast, MA scores lowest on alignment and conciseness due to conflicting agent signals and redundant debate. Detailed analysis and scoring rubrics are provided in Appendix C.4.

#### 7.4 Tool Usage Patterns

Policy Evolution To better understand how AlphaQuanter achieves its performance, we examine the agent’s decision traces and tool-use patterns. The heatmaps in Figure 4 show that tool usage for both the 3B and 7B models is dynamic rather than static, evolving over the course of training. This confirms that the agents actively learn and refine their information-seeking policies instead of relying on a fixed routine.

Divergent Strategies: 3B vs. 7B The two models exhibit divergent learned strategies. The 3B model exhibits a diffuse, low-contrast usage pat-

tinguish informative from uninformative signals. In contrast, the 7B model develops a concentrated, high-contrast pattern, consistent with a selective, discriminative policy for prioritizing information.

Expert-like Heuristic Closer examination of the

- 7B model’s learned policy reveals a sophisticated, expert-level heuristic. It learns to rely heavily on trend, momentum, and volume indicators as primary signals, while treating sentiment and macroeconomic context as secondary but important inputs for decision-making. At the same time, it largely downweights low-frequency fundamental data, likely because such signals add limited value to the rapid decisions required by the task.

7.5 Ablation Studies

We conduct an ablation study to validate the contributions of our key designs, with all results shown in Table 8. First, we evaluate the effectiveness of the process score by selectively removing the format score Rformat and the tool score Rtool. Their removal causes the average ARR to drop by 53.2% and 43.0%, respectively, confirming their critical roles in guiding the agent toward an effective and structured decision-making process. Next, we evaluate the sensitivity of the decision threshold θ. Perturbing θ by ±0.5% yields substantial ARR reductions of 42.1% and 39.2%. Note that ±0.5% equals a ±33% relative change (w.r.t. θ = 1.5%). We also observe a distinct trade-off with MDD: larger θ induces more HOLD signals, lowering trading frequency and MDD, whereas smaller θ increases both activity and risk. As shown in Figure 5, θ is crucial for balancing exploration against exploitation; an improperly calibrated value causes the agent to converge on a single action (e.g., only BUY or HOLD), whereas our setting maintains a dynamic, adaptive policy in noisy financial environments.

- 8 Conclusion

In this paper, we present AlphaQuanter, a singleagent framework that leverages RL to optimize the decision-making process. On five large-cap

U.S. stocks, AlphaQuanter improves ARR while keeping token cost per decision low, supporting practical deployment. Unlike single-agent baselines that ingest all signals at once, AlphaQuanter learns when and what to retrieve, treating tool usage as a policy action. It also avoids the conflicting signals and debate redundancy common in multiagent systems, producing more consistent traces with higher alignment and conciseness, lowering the cost of manual review and verification. Overall, AlphaQuanter offers an effective and practical recipe for training tool-using trading policies that balance profitability, efficiency, and trace quality.

### Limitations

While AlphaQuanter demonstrates promising results, we acknowledge several limitations. First, the agent’s capabilities are bounded by its predefined toolset. It can orchestrate existing functions but cannot generate novel analytical methods. Second, our framework focuses on single-asset decision making, and an important extension of this work is to broaden its scope to the portfolio level. Finally, due to computational constraints, the iterative workflow can lead to an excessively long input context as observations from multiple tool calls accumulate. This highlights the need for a sophisticated agent memory mechanism (Zhang et al., 2024b) to summarize and manage the reasoning history more efficiently.

### Ethics Statement

Developing AI trading agents like AlphaQuanter that autonomously invoke tools and reasoning carries significant ethical responsibilities. Although this technology may ultimately provide a significant advantage to well-resourced institutions, the scope of our current research is strictly confined to a simulated backtesting environment using historical data. As a research prototype, our work does not directly introduce new risks to live markets or participants. Furthermore, a core principle of our work is to enhance transparency by moving away from opaque, black-box models, which we view as a greater ethical concern. In accordance with ethical data processing guidelines, all financial data used in this research is obtained from publicly available APIs and used in accordance with relevant terms of service and license agreements. Therefore, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, we believe this work introduces no additional risk.

## Appendices

### A Detailed Information Sources

#### A.1 Market Data

Market data consists of two tiers: raw price/volume, and a curated set of popular technical indicators. This selection is carefully designed to offer the agent a comprehensive and non-redundant toolkit for analyzing market dynamics. These data are extracted via API from Yahoo Finance1 and Alpha Vantage2.

- A.1.1 Price and Volume Data This data consists of the daily Open, High, Low, and Close (OHLC) prices, the Adjusted Close price, and Volume for each stock, which represents the fundamental record of an asset’s trading activity for a given day.
- A.1.2 Technical Indicators To facilitate a deeper analysis of the raw price data, we allow the agent to query a set of the most widely used technical indicators, which we group by their analytical function:

Trend Indicators These help identify the direction and strength of a price trend.

- • SMA(20): A 20-day Simple Moving Average of the price.
- • EMA(10): A 10-day Exponential Moving Average, giving more weight to recent prices.
- • VWMA(20): A 20-day Volume-Weighted Moving Average, emphasizing periods with higher trading volume.

Momentum Indicators These measure the speed and change of price movements to identify overbought or oversold conditions.

- • RSI(14): The 14-day Relative Strength Index.
- • STOCH(14, 3, 3): The Stochastic Oscillator with the parameters defining its calculation: 14 sets the look-back period for the high-low price range, the first 3 is the smoothing period for the main oscillator line (%K), and the second 3 is the moving average period for its signal line (%D).
- • CCI(21): The 21-day Commodity Channel Index.

- 1https://developer.yahoo.com/api/
- 2https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/

Volatility Indicators These quantify the magnitude of price fluctuations.

- • BBANDS(20, 2): Bollinger Bands. The parameter 20 sets the period for the SMA that forms the middle band. The 2 specifies that the upper and lower bands are plotted at two standard deviations above and below this middle band, respectively.
- • ATR(14): The 14-day Average True Range, a measure of market volatility.

Volume Indicators These use trading volume to confirm trends or signal potential reversals.

- • OBV: On Balance Volume, which relates price changes to volume.
- • CMF: The Chaikin Money Flow, which measures money flow volume over a period.

#### Hybrid Indicator

• MACD(12, 26, 9): The Moving Average Convergence Divergence, calculated by subtracting the 26-period EMA from the 12-period EMA. The 9 refers to a 9-period EMA of the MACD line itself, which serves as a “signal line” to generate trading triggers.

#### A.2 Fundamental Data

To ground the agent’s reasoning in a company’s intrinsic financial health and valuation, we integrated several categories of fundamental data extracted via Alpha Vantage API. These sources provide a holistic view, covering core financial statements, forward-looking analyst expectations, and significant corporate events. The specific data types are detailed below:

- • Earnings Estimates: Forward-looking analyst projections, including annual and quarterly estimates for Earnings Per Share (EPS) and revenue. This dataset also provides metadata such as the number of contributing analysts and their revision histories.
- • Income Statement: Annual and quarterly income statements detailing a company’s revenues, expenses, and profitability.
- • Balance Sheet: Annual and quarterly balance sheets providing a snapshot of a company’s assets, liabilities, and shareholders’ equity.

- • Cash Flow: Annual and quarterly cash flow statements that report the flow of cash from operating, investing, and financing activities, normalized to standard accounting principles.
- • Insider Transactions: Data on historical and recent transactions of company stock executed by key stakeholders, such as executives and board members, which can serve as a signal of internal sentiment.
- • Dividends: A record of historical dividend payments and future declared distributions, offering insight into a company’s policy on returning capital to shareholders.

#### A.3 Sentiment Data

We incorporated two sources of sentiment data: news and Reddit.

- • For news data, we source headlines, summaries, and associated sentiment scores for each stock from the Alpha Vantage API.
- • For Reddit data, we retrieve the most relevant submissions from a publicly available Reddit data dump3, focusing on content from the 11 most popular stock-trading subreddits (e.g., wallstreetbets, stocks, Daytrading, etc.). To manage the input context length, the content of each original post was then summarized using the Qwen3-30BA3B-Instruct model (Yang et al., 2025).

#### A.4 Macroeconomic Indicators

We integrate a set of key macroeconomic indicators extracted from the Alpha Vantage API. These indicators provide context on monetary policy, inflation, and the health of the real economy. The specific data sources are as follows:

- • Treasury Yield: Data on the yields of U.S. Treasury securities across maturities, considered as a benchmark for risk-free interest rates and future economic growth expectations.
- • Federal Funds Rate: The target interest rate set by the U.S. Federal Reserve, provided every month. This is a primary driver of monetary policy and affects borrowing costs throughout the economy.

3https://academictorrents.com/details/ ba051999301b109eab37d16f027b3f49ade2de13

- • Consumer Price Index (CPI): Monthly data reflecting the average change in prices paid by consumers for a basket of goods and services, serving as a primary measure of inflation.
- • WTI Crude Oil Price: The spot price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil. It reflects global energy prices, supply-demand dynamics, and inflationary pressures.
- • Copper Price: The spot price of copper, a critical industrial metal often considered a leading indicator of global economic health and manufacturing activity.

### B Implementation Details

#### B.1 Prompt Design

We design the prompt to promote flexible, evidencedriven exploration rather than predetermined outputs (Deng et al., 2024; Chan et al., 2024). This design is also consistent with recent perspectives that emphasize the role of structured intermediate representations in agentic AI systems (Deng et al., 2025), as well as the broader shift from automationoriented pipelines toward increasingly autonomous, tool-mediated reasoning workflows (Zheng et al., 2025). To achieve this, we first provide a clear task description, the specific target stock and date, and available tools, with constraints on the maximum number of tool calls to ensure efficiency. Then, we enforce the designed workflow by instructing the agent to form and test hypotheses, call only one tool at a time, and clearly show its thinking process within a structured format before each action. The complete prompt is provided in the Figure 6.

#### B.2 Process Score Computation

We provide the detailed pseudocode for computing the process score used in our reward function. Specifically, the process score is decomposed into two components: a FormatScore that evaluates whether the model follows the required response structure (e.g., valid action label, presence of reasoning tags, and appropriate token-length range), and a ToolScore that evaluates the quality of tool usage (e.g., valid arguments, duplicate calls, and reasonable tool-call counts). Please refer to Algorithm 1 (FormatScore) and Algorithm 2 (ToolScore) for the exact scoring procedures, which are consistent with our released implementation and are used throughout RL training.

You are a professional trading strategy analyst. Your goal is to generate a well-reasoned final trade decision (BUY/SELL/HOLD) for a given stock and date through systematic, evidence-based exploration using all available tools. At most 8 tool calls.

You have access to the following tools – use them intentionally and iteratively to test hypotheses and deepen your analysis:

- - [MUST] get_market_data (historical OHLCV)
- - [MUST] get_stock_indicators (trend indicators(SMA20, EMA10, VWMA20), momentum (RSI, STOCH, CCI), volatility (BBANDS, ATR), and volume-based (OBV, CMF), and hybrid(MACD))
- - [OPTIONAL] get_news_data
- - [OPTIONAL] get_reddit_data
- - [OPTIONAL] get_macro_indicators
- - [OPTIONAL] get_balance_sheet
- - [OPTIONAL] get_cashflow
- - [OPTIONAL] get_income_statements
- - [OPTIONAL] get_insider_transactions
- - [OPTIONAL] get_dividends
- - [OPTIONAL] get_earnings_estimate

GUIDELINES: ## Think Like an Analyst, Not a Script. Approach the problem creatively. There is no single fixed workflow. Use your reasoning to form hypotheses, then leverage tools flexibly to explore, validate, or refute your ideas. Be curious and iterative.

## Start with a High-Level Hypothesis. Begin by outlining your initial perspective and what you aim to investigate. This isn’t a rigid plan-it’s a starting point. You’re encouraged to adapt as new evidence emerges.

## Plan, Execute, Then Analyze in the format: <think> ... </think>

- - First, Briefly Plan: Before calling any tool, briefly state your current hypothesis or what you aim to learn with the next step.
- - Then, Call One Tool: Execute only one tool call per step. You must wait for and receive the result before proceeding.
- - Finally, Analyze and Adapt: Interpret the result. Does it confirm your hypothesis? Does it reveal something new? Use this insight to refine your next step.

## One Step at a Time. You are strictly permitted to make only one tool call at a time. The subsequent analysis and planning must be based on the returned result before any further tool is called. This ensures a deliberate and evidence-driven investigative process.

## Conclude with a Decision. After synthesizing all evidence, provide a clear and justified trade recommendation in the format: <answer>BUY | SELL | HOLD</answer>

- - Current date: {date}
- - Target stock ticker: {stock}

#### B.3 Hyperparameters for RL Training

We train AlphaQuanter using verl (Sheng et al., 2025). In Table 9, we list the important parameter settings for the verl framework as well as the hyperparameters referenced in this paper.

#### B.4 Detail of Baseline

For the Market baseline, we implement a passive buy-and-hold strategy by having the agent output BUY on every trading day. For Rule baseline, we implement two standard technical strategies. The

first is Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), a trend-following strategy that uses indicator crossovers to generate trading signals; we employ the standard (12, 26, 9) parameterization for the fast, slow, and signal periods. The second is Z-score Mean Reversion (ZMR), which assumes price reversion to a historical mean. We enter a trade when the Z-score (calculated over a 20-period lookback) exceeds a threshold of 1.0 and exits upon reversion to the mean (Z-score = 0). For RL baselines, we include two widely used deep

Algorithm 1: FORMATSCORE(action,solution_str)

- 1 format_score ← 0
- 2 if action ∉ {"buy","sell","hold"} then // Validate the action label

- 3 format_score ← format_score −1.0

- // (1) Content before the first <tool_call>

4 if text contains a match before the first <tool_call> then 5 segment ← before_tool_call_text 6 len ← CountTokens (segment) 7 if text contains both <think> and </think> then 8 score ← score +0.005

9 if 200 ≤ len ≤ 600 then 10 score ← score +0.1 11 else 12 score ← score +0.05 − 0.01 ⋅ (len − 200)(len − 600)/30000 13 else 14 score ← score +0.001

- // (2) Content between each \nassistant\n and the next <tool_call>

- 15 foreach match in regex \nassistant\n(.*?)<tool_call> do

- 16 if match is not empty then

- 17 len ← CountTokens (match)
- 18 if match contains both <think> and </think> then

- 19 score ← score +0.005

- 20 if 200 ≤ len ≤ 600 then

- 21 score ← score +0.1

- 22 else

- 23 score ← score +0.05 − 0.01 ⋅ (len − 200)(len − 600)/30000

- 24 else

- 25 score ← score +0.001

- 26 return format_score

RL trading agents, A2C and PPO, implemented in the FinRL framework (Liu et al., 2020a) and trained with default hyperparameters on the same five stocks under an identical backtesting protocol. For LM baseline, we implement Chronos-2 (Ansari et al., 2025) by feeding the past 30 days of adjusted closing prices to predict the next-day price, and the predicted return is then used to derive trading decisions. For LLM baselines, we compare against representative prompt-based LLM traders, including FinMem (Yu et al., 2025) and TradingAgents (Xiao et al., 2024). For a fair comparison, we use GPT4o as the backbone LLM for these baselines and run them with our unified data sources/tools. For the Multi-Agent baseline, we adapt the framework from Xiao et al. (2024) and replace the original data sources with our four designated categories of financial data, while retaining the prompts and agent architecture as specified in the original paper. For the Single-Agent baseline, we design a configuration that utilizes our custom prompt structure, as shown in Figure 6, in conjunction with the same four data categories. This baseline serves to

isolate the performance of a single agent with full informational access but without the RL-optimized workflow of AlphaQuanter.

### C Detailed Result Analysis

#### C.1 Full Results of Main Table

Table 10 and Table 11 present the complete backtesting results, providing a detailed breakdown of the ARR, SR, and MDD for each individual stock summarized in Table 5. Our asset-specific analysis reveals several key findings. For GOOGL, most models struggle to generate positive returns, although a few baseline methods achieve marginal gains. Notably, Chronos-2 stands out on this stock by achieving the highest ARR, while its performance on the other stocks is less competitive overall. For META, the majority of strategies are profitable. Notably, the single-agent version of GPT-4o achieved the highest ARR, a result matched by AlphaQuanter-3B, which does so with a superior risk profile, evidenced by a higher SR and a lower MDD. On MSFT, AlphaQuanter-7B delivers the

Algorithm 2: TOOLSCORE(solution_str,extra_info,expected_tool_calls)

- 1 tool_score ← 0

- // (1) Extract tool calls and apply initial penalty

2 (calls,initial_penalty) ← extract_tool_calls_simple (solution_str) 3 tool_score ← tool_score + initial_penalty

// Note: extract_tool_calls_simple() applies, for each JSON-list block: // penalty −= ∣tool_list∣2/10.

- // (2) Validate date arguments in each call

9 duplicate_count ← count_duplicate_calls (calls) 10 tool_score ← tool_score −0.05 ⋅ duplicate_count

- // (4) Penalize tool call count outside the preferred range

- 12 if num_calls ≤ 4 or num_calls > 8 then

- 13 tool_score ← tool_score −∣num_calls − expected_tool_calls∣

- 14 return tool_score

puts a HOLD signal, resulting in zero values for all metrics. This behavior empirically validates our earlier assertion that prompting-based models struggle to differentiate between BUY and HOLD signals under uncertainty. AlphaQuanter-7B once again achieves the highest ARR with satisfactory SR and MDD.

#### C.2 Rolling-Window Robustness Analysis

We further conduct a rolling-window evaluation, directly testing whether our method remains effective when the evaluation window shifts over time. Following common practice in quantitative finance, we evaluate performance over a 3-month horizon using a rolling-origin protocol (Hyndman and Athanasopoulos, 2021). Specifically, on the full January–June 2025 test span, we use a 3-month rolling window and move the window forward by 7 days at each iteration. This creates multiple overlapping but diverse evaluation periods covering substantially different short-term market conditions. Importantly, all models are evaluated without any retraining or hyperparameter tuning; for AlphaQuanter, we keep the original decision threshold θ fixed across all rolling windows. Due to space constraints, we report the most competitive and representative baselines, including Buy & Hold, FinMem, and TradingAgents.

highest ARR, concurrently achieving a strong SR and a relatively low MDD. For NVDA, the results are mixed, with returns split between positive and negative. We observe that multi-agent methods are more prone to negative returns, whereas singleagent approaches more frequently yield positive returns with SRs greater than zero, although with high MDD. Here, AlphaQuanter-7B again secures the highest ARR, with its SR and MDD being comparable to the market baseline. For TSLA, the performance is similarly divided. It is particularly noteworthy that DeepSeek-V3.1 consistently out-

petitive Avg. MDD (17.48%). AlphaQuanter-3B also substantially improves over the representative baselines in Avg. ARR. At the stock level, the rolling-window results remain heterogeneous, as expected in realistic markets, but AlphaQuanter retains strong performance on multiple assets, especially META, NVDA, and TSLA. Importantly, these gains are obtained without altering θ or any other hyperparameters across windows, which reduces the likelihood that the main results are driven by a fortunate choice of the original backtesting period. Overall, the rolling-window evidence supports that AlphaQuanter learns a policy that generalizes more robustly across changing market conditions than the compared baselines.

#### C.3 Reward Decomposition Analysis

To complement the analysis in Section 7.2, Figure 7 displays the learning curves for the primary reward and its constituent components, the result, format, and tool scores, on the validation set during training. A key observation is that the 7B model consistently outperforms the 3B model across all scoring metrics. The result score exhibits a clear upward trend for both models, indicating a steady improvement in the accuracy of the agent’s final actions. The rate of improvement gradually decelerates as the models converge. Regarding the format score, which reflects the length of the agent’s reasoning trace, both models initially show an increase. However, after approximately 250 steps, their paths become different: the 7B model continues to generate more detailed reasoning, while the 3B model’s reasoning length begins to decrease, leading to a decline in its format score. For the tool score, the 3B model initially performs poorly and incurs significant penalties. A case study of its rollouts reveals that in the early stages, the 3B model fails to adhere to instructions by making multiple tool calls within a single turn, which is the primary cause of its low score. This behavior is gradually

rectified through further training.

#### C.4 Detailed Faithfulness Analysis

We provide the detailed scoring rules for the three human-rated faithfulness metrics used in Section 7.3. Each output is rated independently by three Ph.D. raters, who voluntarily agree to participate in this research without receiving any compensation, on an ordinal scale {0, 1, 2}, where higher is better.

Reason-Tool Alignment (0-2) This metric evaluates whether the model’s stated information needs in its reasoning are consistent with its executed tool calls.

- • 2 (High alignment): The reasoning explicitly states the key information to retrieve, and the subsequent tool calls match these stated intentions.
- • 1 (Partial alignment): Some key intentions

are matched, but there is at least one noticeable mismatch.

• 0 (Low alignment): Frequent or severe mismatches between reasoning and tool calls, such that the tool usage appears disconnected from the stated plan.

Evidence Grounding (0-2) This metric evaluates whether the decision is grounded in verifiable evidence from tool outputs. For each output, the rater checks up to two key factual/diagnostic claims that are most central to the final BUY/SELL/HOLD decision. A claim is considered grounded only if it can be directly supported by the retrieved tool outputs in the same episode.

- • 2 (Highly grounded): Both checked key claims are supported by the tool outputs.
- • 1 (Partially grounded): Only one of the two checked claims is supported; the other is missing or unverifiable.
- • 0 (Ungrounded): Neither checked claim is supported by the tool outputs, or the output contains central claims that contradict the retrieved evidence.

Conciseness (0-2) This metric evaluates whether the decision trace remains concise, avoiding redundant tool calls and verbose chatter that obscures the evidence.

- • 2 (Concise): Focused trace with purposeful tool calls (minimal duplication) and compact reasoning linking evidence to the decision.
- • 1 (Moderately concise): Minor redundancy and verbosity, but the path from evidence to decision remains clear.
- • 0 (Not concise): Heavy redundancy with many redundant tool calls, making the decision path difficult to inspect.

Overall Score For each output, we compute an overall faithfulness score as the unweighted average of the three metrics:

+ Grounding + Conciseness

Overall = Alignment

##### 3

We report method-level results by averaging scores across the 50 randomly sampled inputs and across raters in Table 7. Overall, SA+RL (AlphaQuanter) achieves the best alignment and conciseness, while grounding remains competitive across all settings and shows a small but consistent advantage. Typical low-score patterns differ by setting. MA (multi-agent TradingAgents-7B) is most frequently penalized on alignment and conciseness: decision traces can become inconsistent across modules. For example, intermediate reports imply different actions than the final signal, and cross-module claims are not explicitly linked to specific tool outputs.

MA also tends to be verbose due to repeated debate or judge summaries and template-like expansions without evidence gain. SA (SingleAgent-7B) is mainly penalized on alignment when it starts without an explicit plan or follows a shallow ReActstyle chain that weakly motivates why each tool is needed. SA+RL more consistently preserves a coherent reason-tool-response chain and avoids unnecessary back-and-forth, yielding higher alignment and conciseness. Its remaining low-score cases are grounding issues, where minor details are inconsistent with retrieved evidence, though these occur less often than in SA, suggesting that RL improves this capability by encouraging decisions that stay close to the retrieved tool evidence.

Case Study We further provide a brief qualitative comparison of tool-use behavior before and

after RL training, as shown in Figure 8. In the before-training example, the model may issue tool calls that are not mentioned in its reasoning trace, indicating a mismatch between stated information needs and executed actions. In contrast, in the aftertraining example, the model explicitly states its information plan and invokes only the corresponding tools, yielding more consistent and verifiable reasoning-to-action trajectories.

#### C.5 Full Results of Ablation Study

Table 13 and Table 14 present the full results of our ablation study, detailing the ARR, SR, and MDD for each configuration across all five stocks. On MSFT, NVDA, and TSLA, as well as on average, all ablated or adjusted models yield inferior performance compared to the complete AlphaQuanter-7B approach. Focusing on the SR metric, AlphaQuanter-7B remains superior to all other settings on MSFT, NVDA, and in the average case. Notably, the results demonstrate a strong inverse relationship between the decision threshold θ and MDD. Increasing the threshold consistently leads to a significant decrease in MDD across all stocks, while decreasing it results in a significant rise in MDD. This phenomenon is consistent with our analysis in Section 7.5, which attributes this behavior to changes in trading frequency.
