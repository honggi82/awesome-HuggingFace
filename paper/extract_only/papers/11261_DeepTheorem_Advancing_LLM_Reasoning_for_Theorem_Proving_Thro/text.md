### Abstract

Theorem proving serves as a major testbed for evaluating complex reasoning abilities in large language models (LLMs). However, traditional automated theorem proving (ATP) approaches rely heavily on formal proof systems that poorly align with LLMs’ strength derived from informal, natural language knowledge acquired during pre-training. In this work, we propose DeepTheorem, a comprehensive informal theorem-proving framework exploiting natural language to enhance LLM mathematical reasoning. DeepTheorem includes a large-scale benchmark dataset consisting of 121K high-quality IMO-level informal theorems and proofs spanning diverse mathematical domains, rigorously annotated for correctness, difficulty, and topic categories, accompanied by systematically constructed verifiable theorem variants. We devise a novel reinforcement learning strategy (RL-Zero) explicitly tailored to informal theorem proving, leveraging the verified theorem variants to incentivize robust mathematical inference. Additionally, we propose comprehensive outcome and process evaluation metrics examining proof correctness and the quality of reasoning steps. Extensive experimental analyses demonstrate DeepTheorem significantly improves LLM theorem-proving performance compared to existing datasets and supervised fine-tuning protocols, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and reasoning quality. Our findings highlight DeepTheorem’s potential to fundamentally advance automated informal theorem proving and mathematical exploration.

### 1 Introduction

Theorem proving is widely regarded as a pinnacle challenge for evaluating advanced reasoning capabilities of both human and artificial intelligence. It requires integrating diverse cognitive facets such as abstraction, strategic inference, pattern recognition, and meticulous logical deduction. Recent advancements in deep learning, especially in large language models (LLMs), have significantly reshaped the landscape of automated theorem proving (ATP). Much prior work attempts ATP by integrating LLMs with either formal proof engines such as Lean, Coq, and Isabelle (Zheng et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2023; Tsoukalas et al., 2024) or domain-specific languages from ProofWiki (Welleck et al., 2022). However, these proof methods impose a significant barrier for LLMs whose primary strength derives from the vast corpus of natural language and LaTeX-based mathematical texts used during pre-training. This inherent misalignment limits LLMs’ capability in theorem proving, leaving a considerable gap between their potential and actual performance.

In this paper, we present DeepTheorem, a novel informal framework expressly designed to leverage natural language to unleash the latent mathematical reasoning ability of LLMs. Instead of relying on formal proof assistants, DeepTheorem offers a scalable, intuitive, and flexible alternative, enabling LLMs to generate informal mathematical proofs aligning closely with human mathematicians’ heuristic-driven thinking. Central to our approach is the construction of a large-scale benchmark comprising 121K IMO-level informal mathematical theorems with precise annotations such as correctness labels, difficulty levels, diverse mathematical domains, and verifiable theorem variants amenable to advanced reinforcement learning paradigms. Additionally, we introduce a reinforcement learning-based training protocol (RL-Zero) to significantly enhance LLM’s ability to reason mathematically beyond the constraints of supervised fine-tuning (SFT). We also propose comprehensive evaluation metrics that rigorously assess the correctness of generated proofs and the processes underlying the proofs themselves.

Through extensive experiments, we show that leading LLMs still exhibit significant limitations in theorem proving. However, when trained with DeepTheorem, they achieve substantial performance improvements over models trained using existing datasets, showcasing the effectiveness of our natural-language-focused approach. Our results underscore the promise of DeepTheorem to redefine LLM-driven mathematical reasoning, offering a robust platform for continued progress in automated and scalable informal theorem proving.

Contributions Our key contributions are:

- • We introduce DeepTheorem, a large-scale natural-language dataset of 121K informal mathematical theorems and corresponding high-quality proofs at IMO-level difficulty. This dataset is systematically annotated for correctness, difficulty, topic diversity, and includes verifiable theorem variants suitable for advanced reinforcement learning.
- • We propose a novel RL-Zero training method explicitly designed for informal theorem proving, significantly enhancing LLM’s reasoning capacity beyond traditional SFT methods.
- • We develop comprehensive evaluation frameworks assessing both the correctness of theorem proofs (outcome evaluation) and the completeness, logical validity, and correctness of generated reasoning processes (process evaluation).
- • Through extensive experiments, we establish the superiority of our DeepTheorem paradigm, achieving state-of-the-art performance and surpassing existing informal theorem datasets and training methods.

### 2 Dataset

Overview The DeepTheorem dataset1 is a novel, large-scale resource designed to advance LLMs in informal mathematical theorem reasoning. Mined from a diverse web corpus, it addresses the need

1In the rest of this section, DeepTheorem refers specifically to the DeepTheorem training dataset.

[Figure 7]

for challenging, decontaminated, and diverse topics to push LLMs toward frontier theorem proving. As illustrated in Figure 2, each entry in the dataset offers distinct features tailored to support diverse research objectives.

- • Theorem-Proof Pairs: Each sample includes a theorem and its corresponding proof, enabling researchers to develop models for end-to-end mathematical reasoning and automated proof generation.
- • Clearly-Framed Problems Each theorem is presented in a standardized format. The theorem itself is either correct or incorrect. If a theorem is incorrect, then we make sure that it can be mathematically disproved.
- • Correctness Labels: Each theorem is annotated with a True-or-False label, supporting benchmarking of theorem classification, training models for theorem verification, and error detection in theorem formulation.
- • Difficulty Annotations: A fine-grained difficulty score (e.g., complex theorems of level 510)˜ enables stratified analysis of model performance, curriculum learning, and adaptive training strategies.
- • Topic Categories: Mathematical topics (e.g., number theory, geometry) are tagged, allowing targeted studies on domain-specific reasoning, cross-domain transfer learning, and topicspecific model optimization.
- • Step-by-Step Solutions: Detailed proofs generated by o3-mini provide interpretable reasoning paths, ideal for training explainable NLP models, reasoning-augmented generation, and step-wise critique mechanisms.

Comprising approximately 121K curated samples, DeepTheorem empowers large-scale exploration of LLM mathematical reasoning, curriculum learning, and cross-domain generalization. It serves as a versatile resource for advancing automated theorem proving, enhancing model reasoning capability, and developing adaptive learning frameworks, positioning it as a cornerstone for next-generation NLP research in mathematical theorem proving and logical reasoning. In this section, we analyze the key features of DeepTheorem as demonstrated in Figure 2, and describe its overall processing pipeline.

Large scale Comprising 121K theorems, DeepTheorem provides a substantial resource for robust model training and evaluation. Unlike smaller training corpus such as Lean-Workbook (Ying et al., 2024), Deepseek-Prover-v1’s training corpus (Xin et al., 2024), and theorems from OpenR1-Math (Face, 2025), DeepTheorem leverages the vastness of web-sourced content to ensure comprehensive coverage of mathematical concepts and problem types. As shown in Figure 1(a), our dataset consists of approximately 121K theorems, significantly outscaling prior datasets.

[Figure 9]

Figure 3: Difficulty density histogram comparison across widely used training dataset (i.e. LeanWorkbook, Deepseek-Prover-V1, OpenR1 Math) and testing benchmarks (i.e. miniF2F, PutnamBench, FIMO, HMMT2425).

Frontier and extremely challenging theorems DeepTheorem is distinguished by its inclusion of advanced mathematical theorems, each annotated with difficulty levels to enable targeted evaluation and training across a spectrum of complexities. Following the strategy from Gao et al. (2025), we utilize LLM agents for difficulty annotations, which considers factors including problem-solving time and logical complexity, ensuring consistent and reliable categorization. As shown in Figure 3, DeepTheorem emphasizes theorems at high difficulty levels (6–9), surpassing existing corpora in complexity and challenge, presenting significant challenges for state-of-the-art LLMs while aligning with frontier, IMO-level benchmarks such as FIMO (Liu et al., 2023). This focus enables fine-grained benchmarking of LLMs across a spectrum of cognitive demands, from moderately complex to highly intricate mathematical reasoning tasks.

Diverse topics We categorize all the data samples from DeepTheorem following Gao et al. (2025). As shown in Figure 4, DeepTheorem captures the breadth of informal theorem-based reasoning by covering a wide range of mathematical domains, including algebra, discrete math, applied math, calculus, geometry, mathematical analysis, number theory, etc. This extensive topical diversity ensures that the dataset spans nearly the entirety of the mathematical landscape, from foundational concepts to advanced theoretical challenges. By encompassing this wide array of domains, DeepTheorem enables researchers to assess model performance on both specialized and interdisciplinary mathematical tasks, fostering the development of LLMs that can generalize effectively across the full spectrum of mathematical reasoning.

Strict decontamination To preserve evaluation integrity, DeepTheorem employs rigorous decontamination processes to avoid overlap with widely used benchmarks. The targets of our decontamination includes general math reasoning benchmarks - MATH (Hendrycks et al., 2021b), AIME (MAA, a), AMC (MAA, b), Minerva Math (Lewkowycz et al., 2022), OlympiadBench (He et al., 2024), Omni-MATH (Gao et al., 2025), MathOdyssey (Fang et al., 2024), GAOKAO (Zhong et al., 2024), JEEBench (Arora et al., 2023), MMLU-STEM (Hendrycks et al., 2021a), CMATH (Wei et al., 2023), OlympicArena (Huang et al.,

- 2024), GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021), GPQA (Rein et al., 2024) - and theorem proving benchmarks: miniF2F (Zheng et al., 2022), PutnamBench (Tsoukalas et al., 2024), FIMO (Liu et al., 2023), and HMMT (Harvard-MIT Mathematics Tournament, 2024, 2025).

Proofs from advanced LLMs DeepTheorem includes concise, high-quality proof solutions generated by o3-mini, tailored for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). These proofs provide a compact yet complete outline of the logical steps required to prove (or disprove) each theorem, optimized for clarity and brevity. Unlike verbose or overly formal proofs, these proofs, expressed in LaTeX, align with the informal nature of LLMs, making them an effective learning signal. By incorporating these proofs, the dataset enables models to internalize structured reasoning patterns, improving their ability to generate coherent and logically sound mathematical arguments.

##### 2.1 Constructing DeepTheorem

[Figure 12]

Figure 5: The process pipeline of constructing DeepTheorem dataset.

As shown in Figure 5, the construction pipeline of DeepTheorem starts by aggregating raw data from multiple sources, including MMIQC (Liu et al., 2025), WebInstruct (Yue et al., 2024), and NuminaMath-CoT (LI et al., 2024).

Decontamination To ensure the integrity of DeepTheorem, we implement a rigorous decontamination process to eliminate overlap between training and testing datasets. The process employs a recall-and-justify pipeline to identify and remove potential duplicates, consisting of three key steps:

- 1. Embedding Generation: We use an embedding model2 (Reimers & Gurevych, 2019; Toshniwal et al., 2025) to generate sentence embeddings for all theorem statements in the training and testing datasets.
- 2. Similarity Recall: For each training sample, we compute its embedding cosine similarity to all test samples, and recall the top five testing samples exceeding a similarity threshold3.
- 3. Contamination Justification: An LLM4 evaluates whether the recalled test samples are contaminated within the current training sample (Appendix A.1).

This process removed approximately 199K contaminated samples, effectively identifying identical cases, generalized questions, and converse theorems, Removed contaminated examples are shown in Table 1. Approximately 2.6M samples remain for the next processing step.

Quality control and proof generation We also implement a rigorous quality control pipeline for generating and validating theorem statements and their proofs. The process involves four key steps:

- 1. Theorem Justification: An LLM verifies that the question is complete, and indeed a theorem-proving question (Appendix A.2).
- 2. Rationale Summarization: An LLM summarizes the original question and generates a formatted, concise, self-contained theorem (Appendix A.3).
- 3. Proof Generation: o3-mini (high effort) generates the proof solution with True-or-False conclusion about the theorem (Appendix A.4).
- 4. Logical Validation: The LLM performs an extra justification step to check that the theorem-proof pair is logically coherent. (Appendix A.5)

This systematic approach yielded 1.08M high-quality, mathematically sound theorem-proof pairs. Difficulty and single statement annotation We annotate the difficulty levels of DeepTheorem, and remove questions with multiple statements to prove.

- 1. Difficulty Annotation: An LLM analyzes each theorem statement following the strategy of Gao et al. (2025), considering factors such as logical complexity, mathematical prerequisites, and proof length, to assign a difficulty score on a scale of 1 to 9. Only questions with a difficulty score of at least 5 are retained. (Appendix A.6)
- 2. Single-Statement Filtering: We filter out samples that query for proving multiple statements, retaining only those with a single, well-defined theorem to ensure clarity and consistency with evaluation.
- 3. Topic Annotation: Finally, we annotate the topic domain of the mathematical theorems with LLMs. (Appendix A.7)

Finally, the difficulty and single statements filtering results in 121K challenging theorems, yielding the DeepTheorem dataset.

### 3 Theorems Proving via RL

Motivation Conventionally, informal theorem-proving datasets are utilized through supervised fine-tuning (SFT), where models learn to generate proofs by imitating dataset examples. However, recent studies on RL-Zero demonstrate its superior performance over SFT by leveraging a base model’s pretrained knowledge and exploratory capabilities (Jaech et al., 2024; DeepSeek-AI et al.,

- 2025). This raises a natural question: Can we harness the base model’s exploration ability for informal theorem proving? In this section, we explore the possibility of utilizing RL-Zero for informal theorem

proving. The process involves three key steps: 1) data augmentation to generate contradictory theorem variants for binary rewards; 2) RL-Zero training with GRPO (Shao et al., 2024); and 3) Evaluation of the theorem-proof generation.

##### 3.1 Theorems with Verifiable Rewards

Theorems can be disproved To construct a theorem with rewards for RL-Zero, we make the key observation:

Insight

A statement need not be correct but can be also proven incorrect, enabling a binary reward structure compatible with RL-Zero.

This observation allows us to transform DeepTheorem’s theorems into true-or-false variants, facilitating RL training that incentivizes robust reasoning.

To construct such training data, we use an LLM to expand the original theorems into contradictory variants that can be disproved. Specifically, we strictly limit the transformation made to the original theorem, so that the resulting variant is either entailed by or contradictory from the original theorem. For example, consider the following three variants of a theorem (omitting the hypotheses for simplicity):

Theorems Example Original x > 1

- Variant 1 x > 0
- Variant 2 x < 1

Table 2: An example of theorem variation given an original theorem.

If the original theorem can be proved, Variant #1 is also correct and can be mathematically proved in the same manner as the original one, while Variant #2 must be incorrect and can be disproved.

With such logically entailing or contradictory transformations, we are able to construct variants of a theorem that are guaranteed to be correct or incorrect by only accessing the theorem itself but not the proof process, which makes this transformation task much easier than annotating new math statements, and thus allowing a relatively weaker LLM (e.g. Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct, Yang et al., 2024) to perform it. After this expansion phase, we further annotate the completeness of the resulting theorem pool and finally acquire a training set of 242K mathematical theorems that can either be proved or disproved, each with a complete proof trajectory (see Appendix A.8 for more details).

##### 3.2 Binary Rewards Activate Theorem Proof Generation

With the aforementioned theorem variants, we can now apply reinforcement learning to natural language theorem proving. Specifically, we adopt the GRPO algorithm (Shao et al., 2024).

- Table 3: Test data statistics. Each original theorem is manually expanded into multiple entailing or contradictory variants. Random accuracy indicates the expected score of random guessing following the outcome criteria in Figure 6.

Proof generation with RL Inspired by the success of reasoning-specialized models such as R1 and its open-source reproductions (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025; Hu et al., 2025), we encourage the model to enclose its reasoning process in <think> </think> tags in the system prompt to incentivize more detailed reasoning behaviours (see Appendix A.9), and then ask the model to end each proof with either “\boxed{proved}” or “\boxed{disproved}”. In the reward function, we extract this answer and compare it against the ground truth, giving a reward of 1 if the answer matches, and 0 otherwise. We also enforce several sanity checks to prevent model collapse: if the ratio of white spaces in a model’s solution is less than 0.05 or the average character repetition count is greater than 300, then a reward of 0 is issued regardless of the answer.

##### 3.3 Evaluation

The theorem-proving questions used for evaluation are drawn from two challenging benchmarks — FIMO (Liu et al., 2023) and Putnam (Tsoukalas et al., 2024) — and a newly constructed theoremproving subset of HMMT (Harvard-MIT Mathematics Tournament, 2024, 2025).

Outcome Criteria A test case in a theorem testing set is passed if and only if:

- 1. The model explicitly produces a truth value (true or false) for theorems and variants;
- 2. The predicted truth value for the original theorem is correct;
- 3. The predicted truth values for all entailing variants are the same as the original theorem;
- 4. The predicted truth values for all contradictory variants are the inverse of the original theorem.

Figure 6: Outcome evaluation criteria given a testcase with variants

Outcome evaluation Evaluating the correctness of natural language (NL) proofs poses a significant challenge, as it mirrors the complexity faced by humans in assessing the logical coherence and mathematical validity of informal reasoning. Unlike formal theorem-proving systems that rely on structured logic, NL proofs lack a standardized format, making their evaluation inherently subjective and difficult to automate. To address this, we propose a novel evaluation framework that leverages multiple entailing and contradictory variants derived from each theorem. By assessing the model’s ability to consistently assign correct truth values across these variants, we indirectly estimate its theorem justification ability. When the number of variants is sufficiently large, this approach provides a robust proxy for evaluating the correctness of NL proof generation.

Thus, we manually expand each question in the three data sources into multiple entailing or contradictory variants following the same protocol as Section 3.1, and the resulting benchmarks are shown in Table 3. When evaluating a model, we ask it to either prove or disprove each theorem and corresponding variants with the criteria shown in Figure 6.

Process evaluation Since theorem proving requires generating logically validated proofs for each reasoning step, we also develop a process evaluation framework that evaluates the quality of proof along four dimensions:

- • Logical Validity: Check if each step follows logically from the previous one. Flag any logical errors.;
- • Completeness: Verify if all necessary cases and steps are included to prove the theorem;
- • Correctness: Confirm if the final conclusion is correct;
- • Clarity: Assess if the proof is clear, unambiguous, and well-explained.

### 4 Experiments

##### 4.1 Settings

We train two sets of models, using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and zero reinforcement learning (RL-Zero) respectively, both starting from Qwen2.5-Base (Yang et al., 2024). For SFT, we train the models for 3 epochs on the complete proof solutions in the dataset, using one machine for training each model. For RL-Zero, we adopt GRPO with batch size 128, group size 64, and maximum rollout length 8192. We train the models for 1000 steps, and distribute each model across two machines during training. Following the settings of Hu et al. (2025), we do not apply any KL regularization or entropy loss, as we find that KL regularization has a negligible impact on model performance, while entropy loss leads to model collapse.

As a baseline, we select the theorem-proving subset of OpenR1-Math (Face, 2025), the highestquality existing theorem-proving dataset with complete questions and responses. We apply the same processing pipelines to it as detailed in Section 2.1, which yields 66K original theorems and 130K variants in total. We dub this processed dataset OpenR1-Math-Proof.

##### 4.2 Main Results

DeepTheorem with RL-Zero achieves the best performance The main results are presented in Table 4. DeepTheorem demonstrates superior performance over OpenR1-Math-Proof, especially for the 7B backbone and in terms of process evaluation. On the other hand, our RL-Zero training paradigm consistently outperforms SFT, validating the effectiveness of RL-Zero in pushing the models’ reasoning capabilities beyond the limit of SFT.

DeepTheorem achieves strong parameter efficiency We demonstrates that our DeepTheorem-RL strategy achieves strong parameter efficiency in Figure 7. It shows that compared to the Qwen2.5 series, which serves as the backbone model, training DeepTheorem on 1.5 to 7B models significantly improves the informal theorem proving boundary at parameter-performance space. Moreover, DeepTheorem parameter efficiency also surpasses SOTA commercial models such as o1 and o3-mini.

SOTA performance at equal model scale In Table 5, we also provide the evaluation results of SOTA LLMs on the three benchmarks. These results suggest that theorem proving, especially our newly constructed HMMT benchmark, is still quite challenging for LLMs. On the other hand, our 7B model, trained with RL-Zero on DeepTheorem, outperforms SOTA models of much larger sizes, including those specialized in math and reasoning, demonstrating the superior quality of DeepTheorem and our innovative outcome-supervised RL training approach for theorem proving.

Let P be a polynomial of degree n > 1 with integer coefficients and let k be any positive integer. Consider the polynomial Q(x) = P(P(. . . P(P(x)) . . .)), with k pairs of parentheses. Prove or disprove that Q has more than n integer fixed points, i.e. integers satisfying the equation Q(x) = x.

Model Solution: <think> To determine whether the polynomial Q(x) = P(P(. . . P(P(x)) . . .)) with k pairs of parentheses has more than n integer fixed points, we need to analyze the properties of the polynomial P and how the composition of P affects its fixed points.

First, recall that P(x) is a polynomial of degree n > 1 with integer coefficients. The number of integer roots of P(x) − x = 0 (i.e., the number of integer fixed points of P) is at most n by the fundamental theorem of algebra and properties of polynomials. Let’s denote the integer fixed points of P by r1,r2, . . . ,rm, where m ≤ n.

Now, consider the polynomial Q(x) = P(P(. . . P(P(x)) . . .)) with k pairs of parentheses. We need to determine the number of integer solutions to the equation Q(x) = x. If r is an integer fixed point of Q, then r must be an integer fixed point of some composition of P. Specifically, if r is a fixed point of Q, there exists some m ≤ k such that P(m)(r) = r, where P(m) denotes the m-th iterate of P.

The key observation is that the number of integer fixed points of Q is bounded by the number of integer preperiodic points of P. Since P is a polynomial of degree n, the number of integer preperiodic points of P is at most n for each iterate. However, we need to consider the composition Q which is the k-th iterate of P.

The polynomial Q(x) is also of degree nk, and the number of integer roots of Q(x) − x = 0 is at most nk. However, we need to check if it is possible for Q(x) to have more than n integer fixed points. Since each application of P can introduce at most n new fixed points, the total number of integer fixed points of Q is still bounded by the number of preperiodic points of P, which is at most n for each iterate.

To be more precise, let’s consider the fixed points. If r is a fixed point of Q, then r must be a root of the polynomial Pk(x) − x. The polynomial Pk(x) − x is of degree nk, and by the fundamental theorem of algebra, it can have at most nk roots. However, we are interested in integer roots, and the number of integer roots is at most the number of integer preperiodic points of P, which is at most n for each iterate.

Therefore, the number of integer fixed points of Q(x) is at most n, the same as the number of integer fixed points of P for each iterate. Hence, Q(x) cannot have more than n integer fixed points.

Thus, the statement that Q has more than n integer fixed points is false. </think> <answer>

</answer>

This is a non-cherry-picked example from our DeepTheorem-RL-7B model. We analyze this proof in the following dimensions:

- • Correctness. The model accurately identifies that integer fixed points of Q(x) satisfy Q(x) = x, and recognizes that Q(x) has degree nk, with Q(x) − x = 0 having at most nk roots. Its insight that the number of integer fixed points is constrained by the fixed points of P, which are at most n, effectively guides the solution. The model leverages the iterative structure of Q(x) to argue that additional compositions do not increase the number of integer fixed points beyond n, aligning with expected polynomial behavior.
- • Clarity. The proof is well-structured, progressing logically from problem definition to conclusion. Mathematical notation, such as P(m) for the m-th iterate, is precise and standard, enhancing readability. The solution is concise, making it accessible and suitable for a mathematical audience.
- • Strengths. The model’s ability to distill a complex problem into a clear argument showcases its strength in handling polynomial compositions. Its focus on fixed points and iterative properties demonstrates a solid grasp of the underlying mathematics, making it a valuable tool for such proofs.

In summary, the model delivers a clear and correct disproof, highlighting its efficacy in tackling advanced mathematical problems with confidence and precision.

Proof by Construction

Theorem proving Theorem proving is a nontrivial task for natural language processing. In the context of LLMs, theorem proving is typically achieved via formal languages such as Lean, Coq, and Isabelle (Zheng et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2023; Tsoukalas et al., 2024). LLMs specialized at theorem proving have been proposed over the years, represented by GPT-f (Polu & Sutskever, 2020), DeepSeek-Prover (Xin et al., 2024; 2025; Ren et al., 2025), TheoremLlama (Wang et al., 2024), InterLM-StepProver (Wu et al., 2024), and MPS-Prover (Liang et al., 2025). Although most of these works focus on formal theorem proving, NaturalProofs (Welleck et al., 2021) and NaturalProver (Welleck et al., 2022) have emerged

Learning to reason with RL-zero RL-Zero (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025) is a streamlined framework designed to develop reinforcement learning (RL) capabilities in large language models (LLMs) without SFT. While recent advances in LLM reasoning have been significantly influenced by RL techniques (Jaech et al., 2024; DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025; Team, 2024; xAI, 2025; Google, 2025), existing approaches predominantly focus on closed-form questions, addressing only a subset of reasoning problems.

In this work, we investigate the application of RL-Zero in process-oriented reasoning, specifically in informal mathematical theorem-proving tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to apply the RL-Zero framework to informal theorem proving, marking a significant advance in enabling LLMs to address more diversified reasoning tasks in mathematical and logical domains.

### 6 Conclusion

In this paper, we introduced DeepTheorem, a novel informal theorem-proving paradigm involving a large-scale annotated dataset of 121K IMO-level informal mathematical theorems and corresponding high-quality natural-language proofs, alongside systematically constructed verifiable theorem variants. We further proposed a novel RL-Zero method specifically tailored for informal mathematical reasoning, significantly surpassing supervised fine-tuning frameworks in theorem proving. Comprehensive evaluations involving outcome accuracy and detailed reasoning process assessment demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art theorem-proving performance and significantly pushing LLM reasoning boundaries. Through these contributions, DeepTheorem provides a robust foundation for future advancements in automated mathematical theorem proving, leveraging natural language flexibility to empower scalable, human-like reasoning abilities in large language models.

<example math problem> [Question]: Let P be a convex polygon with n sides, n ≥ 3. Any set of n − 3 diagonals of P that do not intersect in the interior of the polygon determine a triangulation of P into n − 2 triangles. If

- P is regular and there is a triangulation of P consisting of only isosceles triangles, find all the possible values of n. [Solution]:

We label the vertices of P as P0, P1, P2, . . . , Pn. Consider a diagonal d = Pa Pa+k, k ≤ n/2 in the triangulation. We show that k must have the form 2m for some nonnegative integer m. This diagonal partitions P into two regions Q, R, and is the side of an isosceles triangle in both regions. Without loss of generality suppose the area of Q is less than the area of R (so the center of P does not lie in the interior of Q); it follows that the lengths of the edges and diagonals in Q are all smaller than d. Thus d must the be the base of the isosceles triangle in

- Q, from which it follows that the isosceles triangle is △PaPa+k/2 Pa+k, and so 2|k. Repeating

this process on the legs of isosceles triangle (PaPa+k/2, Pa+kPa+k/2), it follows that k = 2m for some positive integer m (if we allow degeneracy, then we can also let m = 0). Now take the

isosceles triangle PxPyPz, 0 ≤ x < y < z < n in the triangulation that contains the center of P in its interior; if a diagonal passes through the center, select either of the isosceles triangles with that diagonal as an edge. Without loss of generality, suppose PxPy = PyPz. From our previous result, it follows that there are 2a edges of P on the minor arcs of PxPy, PyPz and 2b edges of P on the minor arc of PzPx, for positive integers a, b. Therefore, we can write

n = 2 · 2a + 2b = 2a+1 + 2b,

so n must be the sum of two powers of 2. We now claim that this condition is sufficient. Suppose without loss of generality that a + 1 ≥ b; then we rewrite this as

n = 2b(2a−b+1 + 1).

Lemma 1: All regular polygons with n = 2k + 1 or n = 4 have triangulations that meet the conditions. By induction, it follows that we can cover all the desired n. For n = 3,4,

this is trivial. For k > 1, we construct the diagonals of equal length P0P2k−1 and P2k−1+1P0. This partitions P into 3 regions: an isosceles △P0P2k−1P2k−1+1, and two other regions. For these two regions, we can recursively construct the isosceles triangles defined above in the second paragraph. It follows that we have constructed 2(2k−1 − 1) + (1) = 2k − 1 = n − 2 isosceles triangles with non-intersecting diagonals, as desired. Lemma 2: If a regular polygon with n sides has a working triangulation, then the regular polygon with 2n sides also has a triangulation that meets the conditions. We construct the diagonals P0P2, P2P4, . . . P2n−2P0. This partitions P into n isosceles triangles of the form △P2kP2k+1P2k+2, as well as a central regular polygon with n sides. However, we know that there exists a triangulation for the n-sided polygon that yields n − 2 isosceles triangles. Thus, we have created (n) + (n − 2) = 2n −2 isosceles triangles with non-intersecting diagonals, as desired. In summary, the answer is all n that can be written in the form 2a+1 + 2b, a, b ≥ 0. Alternatively, this condition can be expressed as either n = 2k, k ≥ 2 (this is the case when a + 1 = b) or n is the sum of two distinct powers of 2, where 1 = 20 is considered a power of 2. [Source]: USAMO 2008 </example math problem> ## Summarization The problem asks for the possible values of n for a regular n-sided polygon that can be completely triangulated into isosceles triangles using non-intersecting diagonals. The solution involves analyzing the properties of the diagonals forming isosceles triangles and deducing that n can be expressed in terms of powers of 2. ## Difficulty Rating: 7 Reason: The problem involves understanding properties of isosceles triangles in the context of polygon triangulation and requires critical reasoning to establish relationships between the number of sides and powers of 2, making it more complex than typical undergraduate-level problems.

- - The math problem can be categorized into multiple domains, but no more than three. Separate the classification chains with semicolons(;).
- - Your classification MUST fall under one of the aforementioned subfields; if it really does not fit, please add "Other" to the corresponding branch. For example: Algebra -> Intermediate Algebra -> Other. Only the LAST NODE is allowed to be "Other"; the preceding nodes must strictly conform to the existing framework.

- - The math domain must conform to a format of classification chain, like "Applied Mathematics -> Probability -> Combinations".
- - Add "=== report over ===" at the end of the report.

<example math problem>. [Question] Determine the greatest real number C, such that for every positive integer n ≥ 2, there exists x1, x2,..., xn ∈ [−1,1], so that

##### A.8 Theorem Variant Construction

Meta Prompt for Constructing Theorem Variants

I’m going to give you a math proof question and its solution. Your task is to follow the steps below to write a new question based on the given one. Here is the original question and solution:

“‘question <question> “‘, “‘solution <solution> “‘

Please follow these steps:

- 1. The original question asks to "prove or disprove" a statement, where the statement can be "proved". Please write a new question by negating the original statement, so that it can now be "disproved". For example, if the original statement is x = y, you may change it to x < y or x ̸= y; if the statement is "there exists xxx", you may change it to "there does not exist xxx". When negating the original question, you should make minimal changes, i.e. leave as much background information unchanged as possible.
- 2. After changing the question, the solution should be changed accordingly. You do not have to write a new solution, and the original solution can probably be reused. For example, if the original question asks to prove x = y and the new question asks to prove x < y, you may simply add a step to the original proof like "since we proved x = y, the statement x < y is disproved". However, check the wording of the solution so that it tries to "prove" the statement at first, and then naturally transit to finding that it cannot be proved, but can be disproved instead.
- 3. The original solution ends with "\boxed{proved}". Your new solution should end with "\boxed{disproved}". Output the new question and solution in two blocks: “‘question new question “‘ “‘solution corresponding solution “‘

System Prompt for RL Training

A conversation between User and Assistant. The User gives a statement, and the Assistant either proves or disproves it. The Assistant first thinks about the reasoning process in the mind and then provides the User with the answer. The reasoning process is enclosed within <think> </think> and the answer is enclosed within <answer> </answer> tags, respectively, i.e., <think> reasoning process here </think> <answer> answer here </answer>. If you prove the statement, answer with "proved". If you disprove the statement, answer with "disproved". You must put your answer inside <answer> </answer> tags, i.e., <answer> \boxed{proved} or \boxed{disproved} </answer>. And your final answer will be extracted automatically by the \boxed{} tag.

##### A.10 Process Evaluation Framework

Meta Prompt for Process Evaluation

You are an expert in scoring solutions for mathematical proof questions. The following question asks to prove or disprove a statement, where the statement may be either true or false. The test subject is asked to end their proof with \boxed{proved} if they prove the statement to be true, and \boxed{disproved} if they prove the statement to be false.

The question: “‘<question>“‘ The ground truth of the statement: “‘<answer>“‘ The test subject’s solution: “‘ <solution>“‘

Your task is to evaluate the proof’s quality and assign a score from 0 to 1 based on four criteria: logical validity (40%), completeness (30%), correctness (20%), and clarity (10%). Instructions:

- 1. Analyze the proof step by step.
- 2. For each criterion:

- - Logical Validity: Check if each step follows logically from the previous one. Flag any logical errors.
- - Completeness: Verify if all necessary cases and steps are included to prove the theorem.
- - Correctness: Confirm if the final conclusion is correct.
- - Clarity: Assess if the proof is clear, unambiguous, and well-explained.

- 3. Assign a sub-score (0 to 1) for each criterion and compute the total score using the weights: (0.4 × validity) + (0.3 × completeness) + (0.2 × correctness) + (0.1 × clarity).
- 4. Provide a brief explanation (2-3 sentences) summarizing any errors or issues and justifying the score. Final output format: “‘ { "score": float, "validity": float, "completeness": float, "correctness": float, "clarity": float,

"explanation": str } “‘ where "score" is the total score, and "validity", "completeness", "correctness", "clarity" are the subscores.
