## Rethinking Reflection in Pre-Training

Essential AI San Francisco, CA research@essential.ai

### Abstract

A language model’s ability to reflect on its own reasoning provides a key advantage for solving complex problems. While most recent research has focused on how this ability develops during reinforcement learning, we show that it actually begins to emerge much earlier—during the model’s pre-training. To study this, we introduce deliberate errors into chains-of-thought and test whether the model can still arrive at the correct answer by recognizing and correcting these mistakes. By tracking performance across different stages of pre-training, we observe that this self-correcting ability appears early and improves steadily over time. For instance, an OLMo-27B model pre-trained on 4 trillion tokens displays self-correction on our six self-reflection tasks.

### 1 Introduction

Reflection enhances a model’s ability to adapt its response to prior reasoning, thereby improving the accuracy of its outputs. Recent work reports that "behaviors such as reflection... emerge as a result of the model’s interaction with the reinforcement learning environment" [DeepSeek-AI, 2025a]. Attributing the development of capabilities to validate such claims necessitates a comprehensive evaluation throughout the training phases. In this work, we propose an exhaustive framework to measure reflection and we observe the phenomenon consistently during pre-training.

Benchmarking reflection using existing reasoning datasets [Mondorf and Plank, 2024] has been challenging. Reflection is often sparse in such tasks, and each model exhibits distinct error patterns that yield unique manifestations of reflective behavior [Madaan et al., 2023, Liu et al., 2025]. We address this challenge by distinguishing between situational-reflection and self-reflection. In the situational setting, a model examines reasoning chains created by another source, such as a different frontier model. In self-reflection, the model considers its own reasoning processes. We calibrate a model’s ability to solve a task when provided with some confounding reasoning that leads to an incorrect answer, and thereby measure reflection capabilities throughout the pre-training process.

Figure 2 shows an attempt by a partially pre-trained OLMo-2 checkpoint [OLMo et al., 2025] to solve a coding task [Gu et al., 2024]. In this case, the model is given a question about determining the input to the Python function f that leads to the output ‘avdropj gsd ’. In its first attempt, the model – which has 32 billion parameters and was pre-trained on 4.8 trillion tokens – repeats the output as the answer, ‘advdropj gsd ’. Upon prompting it with its incorrect thinking plus a suffix of ‘Wait,’, the model is able to successfully self-reflect and generates “I think I got it wrong. ... the value of ?? should be [‘gsd’, ‘avdropj’]”.

[Figure 2]

By programmatically introducing erroneous chains-of-thought (CoTs), featuring elements such as arithmetic perturbations and logical inconsistencies, we can control and scale the extent of reflection needed to complete these tasks correctly. This also maintains the established CoT format [Wei et al., 2022]. Furthermore, our algorithmic approach permits the creation of these datasets in a relatively rapid and economical manner by adapting established reasoning benchmarks, which in turn allows for a comprehensive study of models’ reflection abilities across a diverse range of domains. Our six datasets, spanning the domains of Mathematics, Coding, Logical Reasoning, and Knowledge Acquisition, are designed to assess both situational-reflection and self-reflection capabilities.1.

The results of evaluating pre-training checkpoints from the OLMo-2 family of models with varying compute on our set of six diverse datasets indicate that reflection is ubiquitous across domains. Even a simple trigger phrase like “Wait,”[Muennighoff et al., 2025] enables partially pre-trained models to consistently identify both introduced errors and their own generated errors. Specifically, 231 of 240 dataset-checkpoint pairs demonstrate at least one instance of situational-reflection and 154 of 240 pairs demonstrate at least one instance of self-reflection. With increasing pre-training, models correct more adversarial examples, leading to an average Pearson correlation between accuracy and log(pre-training compute) of 0.76 across tasks. Furthermore, as pre-training progresses, models increasingly recover from incorrect prior reasoning, the rate of explicit reflection in model generations increases, and explicit reflection increasingly contributes to recovery from confounding CoTs.

The contributions of this paper are threefold:

- • We introduce a systematic method to create six datasets across Code, Knowledge Acquisition, Logical Reasoning, and Mathematics to study a model’s ability to reflect.
- • We demonstrate that pre-trained models of varying capacities and training compute can elicit reflection to correct inaccurate prior reasoning using simple interjections in a wide variety of domains.
- • We observe that continually improving pre-training leads to better reflection, requiring fewer test-time tokens to solve the same number of tasks.

### 2 Related Work

Evaluating Reasoning in LLMs Real-world applicability of natural language systems is dependent on reasoning capabilities [Wos et al., 1992, Schuster et al., 2019, Mondorf and Plank, 2024]. LLMs, combined with prompting techniques such as Chain of Thought [Wei et al., 2022], Tree of Thought [Yao et al., 2023], and Self-Consistency [Wang et al., 2023b] have been successfully used to solve a variety of reasoning tasks [Kojima et al., 2022, Bubeck et al., 2023]. Reasoning is typically measured by observing model outcomes [Fu et al., 2023a, Liu et al., 2023], through generation traces [Saparov and He, 2023, Dziri et al., 2023, Willig et al., 2022] and interactive engagement [Zhuang et al., 2024, Wang et al., 2023a, Bertolazzi et al., 2023]. Prior work also conducts parametric attribution of models’ internal network to identify reasoning characteristics by studying attention patterns [Hou

- et al., 2023], activation flows [Dutta et al., 2024] and individual layers [Pirozelli et al., 2024]. These methods are primarily meant to evaluate post-trained models, while we are interested in diagnostic techniques to elicit reasoning throughout the training phases, similar in spirit to the study of model performance through parameter and training data scaling [Kaplan et al., 2020]. In this work, we study reasoning by evaluating the emergence of reflection through adversarial datasets. These datasets require models to reason through multi-step hints, which contain minor errors, in order to complete the tasks successfully.

Adversarial Attacks on LLMs Adversarial inputs have long been used to expose vulnerabilities in neural networks [Szegedy et al., 2014, Biggio et al., 2013, Huang et al., 2017]. More recently, similar techniques have been applied to LLMs, demonstrating their susceptibility to carefully crafted prompts [Schwinn et al., 2023]. These attacks have successfully targeted models’ policy alignment [Deng et al., 2022, Wei et al., 2023], safety [Schuster et al., 2020, Carlini et al., 2021, Kang et al., 2024], and robustness [Zou et al., 2023, Shen et al., 2024, Xu

- et al., 2024], highlighting large vulnerabilities. Several approaches have proposed adversarial training to improve model defenses against such attacks [Zhu et al., 2019, Jiang et al., 2020, Xhonneux et al., 2024]. Alternatively, the primary goal of our work is not to demonstrate models’ vulnerabilities to adversaries but rather to highlight how such datasets can be used to consistently and thoroughly evaluate their reasoning capabilities. We achieve this by introducing chains-of-thought [Kojima et al., 2022], where steps [Lightman et al., 2023] are largely correct, but contain mistakes that require reflection [Lightman et al., 2023, Fu et al., 2023b].

Train Time vs Test Time Tradeoff The increasing reliance on test-time compute in advanced reasoning models, such as Open AI’s o1 [OpenAI, 2024b] and DeepSeek-R1 [DeepSeek-AI, 2025a], has reignited discussions on the optimal allocation of compute [Kaplan et al., 2020, Hoffmann et al., 2022]. Prior work studies the trade-offs between train-time and test-time compute [Snell et al., 2024], as well as the impact of post-training techniques like supervised fine-tuning [Li et al., 2025, Chen et al., 2025] and reinforcement learning [DeepSeek-AI, 2025a, Wang et al., 2024], on reasoning performance [Liu et al., 2025]. Inference-time paradigms - such as tree search [Yao et al., 2023], chain-of-thought prompting [Wei et al., 2022] and budget-forcing [Muennighoff et al., 2025] - interact with a model’s pretrained representations [Yeo et al., 2025, Ruis et al., 2025, Gandhi et al., 2025]. However, in our work, we contribute a complementary perspective by demonstrating that certain reasoning capabilities can gradually emerge during pre-training itself, even in the absence of fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, or

specialized test-time inference techniques. Our findings suggest that key aspects of reasoning can be instilled through pre-training alone, potentially changing the calculus of the optimal use of compute across training and inference.

### 3 Approach

Our objective is to measure reflection comprehensively and at scale. We present a definition of reflection 3.1, programmatically create tasks to elicit reflection 3.2, and rigorously measure the presence of reflection 3.3.

#### 3.1 Defining Reflection

Reflection is a form of metacognition that involves examining information, evaluating the reasoning that underlies it, and adjusting future behavior based on that evaluation. In the context of a language model, this process can apply to information introduced from an external source or generated by the model itself. In this work, we create two settings in which to elicit and measure reflection:

Situational-reflection is when a model reflects on information created by another source, such as a different model.

Self-reflection is when a model reflects on its own generated outputs. We also comprehensively characterize reflection by means of two forms:

Explicit reflection occurs when a model produces tokens that by their meaning recognize and address mistakes in the adversarial context. Explicit reflection may be present in either correct model outputs (in other words, those that constitute correct answer to our adversarial tasks) or incorrect model outputs.

Implicit reflection occurs when a model navigates adversarial contexts to solve a task correctly without outputting tokens that explicitly identify errors in prior reasoning. In our definition, this means that implicit reflection cannot result in an incorrect answer to our adversarial tasks. This allows us to distinguish between, on one hand, cases where explicit reflection is absent but implicit reflection may be inferred to have taken place and, on the other hand, cases where no reflection took place at all.

#### 3.2 Eliciting Reflection with Adversarial Reflection Datasets

We present an algorithm to generate adversarial datasets that elicit reflection behavior from language models. The algorithm creates adversarial CoTs that lead to incorrect solutions. Unlike self-reflection, where we can draw from the models’ own mistakes, we must devise artificial adversarial CoTs for situational-reflection. At a high level, these adversarial CoTs are created by corrupting correct CoTs in ways that mimic human reasoning errors, such as logical missteps and arithmetic miscalculations. In both cases, when we provide the CoTs in context, the models must reflect on the mistakes and fix them to arrive at the correct solution. We believe that these settings are necessary to comprehensively study reflection.

The task design includes appending a trigger token, such as "Wait,", to promote continued reasoning throughout the task-solving process.

The algorithm has two variants. Algorithms 1 and 2 create the situational-reflection and self-reflection datasets respectively.

#### 3.3 Measuring Reflection

We propose an automated approach to measure the reflective capabilities of models using adversarial datasets, based on our earlier categorization of reflection (see 3.1):

Measuring explicit reflection: To identify instances of explicit reflection, we develop a prompt-based LLM classifier that detects when a model’s output explicitly acknowledges and addresses errors within the provided adversarial context, regardless of whether the model reached the correct answer or not. The classifier is described below in 4.3.

Measuring implicit reflection: We stipulate that all model generations that lead to the correct answer in the presence of adversarial context are attributable to reflection, even if no tokens that relate to reflection are outputted. We believe this accords with an everyday understanding of ’reflection’ in the sense of describing human

metacognition. An implication of our approach is that, by construction, generations that produce correct answers but are not identified by the explicit classifier are categorized as instances of implicit reflection.

See Section 4.3 for further details on the specific reflection metrics that we used.

### 4 Experimental Setup

In order to comprehensively study reflection, we evaluate partially pre-trained models spanning different computational budgets, with variations in both parameter count and number of training tokens 4.1.

Our study includes two types of adversarial tasks 4.2: (1) Situational-Reflection, where adversarial chains of thought are systematically generated from existing datasets using frontier models; and (2) Self-Reflection, where adversarial chains of thought are derived from the model’s own previous incorrect responses to original task instances.

Our evaluation also examines whether model outputs demonstrate explicit reflective reasoning 4.3. We detail our infrastructure set-up in Section 4.4.

- 4.1 Model Families

OLMo-2

OLMo-2 [OLMo et al., 2025] is a fully open-source, open-weight LLM project with training checkpoints available for 7B, 13B and 32B parameter variants. We evaluated a total of 40 checkpoints (see Appendix B for details). We aimed for equally spaced checkpoints and used the closest alternatives in cases when they were not available.

#### Qwen2.5

We evaluated Qwen2.5’s 0.5B, 3B, 7B, 14B, 32B and 72B parameter variants [Qwen et al., 2025]. See Appendix B for details.

#### 4.2 Datasets

We evaluate the reflection phenomenon over a wide set of tasks, creating six adversarial datasets based on BIG-Bench Hard (BBH) [bench authors, 2023], CruxEval [Gu et al., 2024], GSM8K [Cobbe et al., 2021], GSM8K-Platinum [Vendrow et al., 2025] and TriviaQA [Joshi et al., 2017]. An overview of our adversarial datasets can be found in Tables 1 & 2.

We utilize models DeepSeek-V3 (referred to as DS-V3) [DeepSeek-AI, 2025b], GPT-4o2 [OpenAI, 2024a], and SentenceTransformers [Reimers and Gurevych, 2020], as well as multiple automated checks and manual inspections in our pipeline to ensure quality and robustness in our datasets.

Situational-Reflection Datasets: Creation of these datasets involves a multi-step pipeline where we prompt an LLM to create adversarial CoTs (see also Algorithm 1). For reasoning tasks, the original tasks may contain the CoTs as a dataset artifact; if not, we create them using a frontier model such as GPT-4o or DS-V3. Subsequently, the correct CoTs are used to develop adversarial CoTs by introducing deliberate errors that lead to wrong answers. In addition, checks are made at the end to ensure that CoTs do not reveal their misleading intentions. The pipelines and prompts have been carefully designed to minimize errors and are dataset-specific, but the overall framework can be generalized to any domain and dataset.

Self-Reflection Datasets: These datasets are created by executing the LLM we want to evaluate on the base task and collecting CoTs corresponding to the questions the models failed on (see also Algorithm 2). Since we are interested in the reflection abilities of models as pre-training progresses, we only keep the questions incorrectly answered by all checkpoints at each parameter scale in the self-reflection datasets to ensure consistent comparison across pre-training checkpoints.

Extensive details on our dataset-specific pipelines, checks, and filters can be found in Appendix F.

Table 3: Metrics and corresponding criteria for evaluating reflection across different settings.

Metrics As seen in Table 3, for both situational reflection and self-reflection settings, Accuracy is the fraction of task instances that a model correctly solves. Independent of Accuracy, we utilize our Explicit Reflection Classifier to measure the Explicit Reflection Rate, which is the fraction of task instances where the model output exhibits explicit reflection, regardless of whether they are correct or not. We additionally report Explicit Reflection Accuracy, which is the fraction of task instances that a model both correctly solves and exhibits explicit reflection on. Finally, Implicit Reflection Accuracy is the fraction of task instances where the model output is correct and does not exhibit explicit reflection. Details about Accuracy metrics for each dataset can be found in Appendix H.

Furthermore, for each data point, we report the pre-training compute as 6nt, where n and t are the number of parameters and training tokens respectively. More details about our train time and test time compute formulations can be found in section 5.4.

Explicit Reflection Classifier We develop a prompt-based classifier to determine whether a model output exhibits explicit reflection. DeepSeek-V3 [DeepSeek-AI, 2025b] is prompted with a description of what is meant by "reflection" along with two to four explicit reflection exemplars. Some examples of the kind of explicit reflection phrases that this classifier is intended to detect are shown in Table 5. We validated the classifier against human-annotated golden labels on GSM8K, cruxeval-o, and TriviaQA (120 questions per benchmark; see Appendix G for details on the annotation process). Although our classifier recalls fewer instances of reflection (see Table 4), its precision is high enough to validate its usefulness. In the worst case, we will under-report reflection behaviors, but be more confident when we do report them.

- 4.4 Infrastructure

Our experiment set-up uses the vLLM inference framework [Kwon et al., 2023] for hosting OLMo-2 and Qwen models. We host DeepSeek-V3 using SGLang [Zheng et al., 2024]. We use a cluster of AMD MI300x Accelerators and Kubernetes to schedule jobs into it.

To comprehensively measure reflective reasoning across domains, our classifier separates explicit and implicit reflection in BBH, cruxeval-i, cruxeval-o, GSM8K, GSM8K-Platinum and TriviaQA for the situationalreflection 5.1 and self-reflection 5.3 settings. To our surprise, we discover a strong presence of reflection, which grows with more training compute. Furthermore, as pre-training progresses, models increasingly recover from confounders, the rate of explicit reflection increases, and explicit reflection increasingly contributes to

- Table 6: Partially pre-trained models can correct non-zero adversarial examples across tasks and with increasing pre-training, get higher accuracy and more explicit reflection.

In Table 6, it is promising that with the exception of the cruxeval-i task, for all tasks, every OLMo-2 pre-training checkpoint shows signs of recovery from situational confounders either implicitly or explicitly 4. This leads to 231 of 240 dataset-checkpoint pairs demonstrating at least one instance of situational-reflection. However, to vindicate our hypothesis that models progressively develop and use explicit reflection, most recoveries should be attributed to explicit situational-reflection. In essence, what we are looking for, with more pre-training compute, is the increasing frequency of (a) recovering from situational confounders, (b) explicitly reflecting on situational confounders, and (c) recovering from situational confounders with explicit reflection.

The high positive Pearson correlations of each metric and log(pre-training compute) [Cohen et al., 2009] imply (a),

- (b), and (c). We also see generally low correlation of implicit reflection accuracy with log(pre-training compute). Together, these results emphasize that with greater pre-training, models tend to solve more adversarial instances successfully and increasingly prefer to use explicit reflection while doing so. For instance, GSM8K-Platinum shows in Figure 3 that, with increasing pre-training, models across parameter counts solve a majority of the task instances by explicitly reflecting on errors. TriviaQA is an exception where significant improvements can be attributed to implicit reflection, a consequence of the task primarily measuring knowledge acquisition, with several of the instances capable of being solved without explicit reasoning. Detailed results for all six tasks can be found in Appendix C.

4Unless explicitly stated otherwise, all studies were performed on publicly available OLMo-2 checkpoints (see Table 1). We take an average of three runs to reports each experiment.

#### 5.2 Models Reflect Even Without Triggers; ‘Wait,’ Enhances Explicitness and Accuracy

In order to understand the causal role of the ‘Wait,’-trigger, we investigate model performance on GSM8K-Platinum with triggers at opposite extremes. Specifically, we study model performance with no trigger (A) and with a trigger (B) containing the explicit admission ‘Wait, I made a mistake’. We choose A as a mode in which to draw minimum attention to the mistakes in the adversarial CoTs. In contrast, we choose B as a mode that emphasizes the existence of an error in the CoT. Figure 4 plots these results.

The results first confirm the hypothesis that even without a trigger, models can increasingly succeed on situational confounders as pre-training progresses. The role of ‘Wait,’ in the results above in Section 5.1 is further clarified here. We see that the models’ performance on this task is bounded by the two extremes of A and B. In scenario A, models improve accuracy by reflecting implicitly and in scenario B models reflect explicitly by construction and thus greatly improve performance. The ‘Wait,’-setting behaves like A when implicitly reflecting and like B when explicitly reflecting. Interestingly, as seen in Figure 4, its performance can be decomposed as accWait = eWait ∗ accB + (1 − eWait) ∗ i_accA, where eWait is the rate of explicit reflection and i_acc is the implicit reflection accuracy.

Furthermore, we see that a significant elevation in performance is attributable to the ‘Wait,’-trigger. This is because the trigger elicits explicit reflection at a rate that increases with pre-training, and it also attains the performance achieved by the corresponding B-triggered models, which, as noted above, we choose as a mode that emphasizes the existence of an error in the CoT. In other words, when the model, conditioned on an adversarial CoT with

‘Wait,’, exhibits explicit reflection, its performance is comparable to when the model is explicitly told that the CoT contains a mistake. Conversely, when the model is conditioned on an adversarial CoT with ‘Wait,’ but does not exhibit explicit reflection, its performance is in line with the mode where the model is conditioned on the adversarial CoT only. This establishes the causal connection for explicit reflection through ‘Wait,’ in improving accuracy.

#### 5.3 Explicit Self-Reflection is Harder but Advances With More Compute

At first glance, the rarity of self-reflection in Table 7 might be seen as a negative result. However, this can be explained by the fact that in this setting the models are evaluated on the task instances that they answered incorrectly - so by design, they are particularly difficult (see 2 in section F). Nonetheless, in about 64.2% of task attempts, the models do demonstrate at least some ability to self-correct.

In order to disambiguate self-reflection and self-correction, we plot the rate of reflection generated by the models, independent of whether the tasks were solved in Figures 5. These results indicate a strong trend that as pre-training progresses, models get better at explicitly highlighting their own errors. For cruxeval-i we notice that with increasing pre-training models tend to learn to self-correct. However, they are able to self-reflect much earlier. This suggests the natural progression of self-reflection skills before self-correction.

[Figure 5]

###### Figure 4: Models can reflect and correct situational adversaries even without triggers. We see that the ‘Wait,’ trigger emulates a linear combination of no trigger (A) and a trigger that emphasizes a mistake in the prior reasoning (B), weighted by the checkpoint’s ability to elicit explicit reflection.

Table 7: Partially pre-trained models can correct non-zero adversarial examples across tasks, and with increasing pre-training, achieve higher accuracy and more explicit self-reflection.

How these germs of self-reflection evolve into sophisticated autonomous reasoning abilities with post-training is an open question that we leave for future work. We hypothesize that there must be a critical threshold of pre-trained self-reflection beyond which the model has a high likelihood of developing into a test-time reasoner. It is surprising to us that we see such levels of explicit self-reflection when learning from organic web datasets [Li et al., 2024]. Pinpointing data distributions that promote explicit self-reflection during pre-training is another natural next step of our work. Detailed results on all six tasks can be found in Appendix D.

#### 5.4 One Can Trade Training for Test-time Compute

We investigate the trade-off between increased investment in train-time compute and the corresponding expenditure required at test-time to achieve comparable accuracy on the downstream task. We approach this by estimating the train-time compute as 6nt where n and t are the number of parameters and training tokens, respectively, and test-time compute as 2nw where w represents the number of words generated to solve a certain number of adversarial questions. 5

We begin by specifying a set of target numbers of adversarial questions to be answered correctly. We then plot a curve for each of these targets. We study this for the GSM8K-Platinum adversarial dataset introduced earlier. We follow a sequential test-time scaling approach by appending the trigger “Wait,” to model generations. In fact, we introduce two “Wait,” triggers to enable weaker models to reach the same metric level as stronger models. This mimics the sequential method for scaling test-time compute in [Muennighoff et al., 2025].

As we see in Figure 6, as train-time compute increases, the test-time compute requirement decreases in OLMo-2-32B checkpoints. This result further supports our hypothesis that the model gets better at reflection as pre-training progresses, implying less test-time compute for a given level of accuracy.

[Figure 8]

- Figure 6: Tradeoff between train-time and test-time compute for OLMo-2-32B pre-training checkpoints. Each dotted trendline depicts a fixed metric value on GSM8K-Platinum. Each dashed line is a trendline for the isocorrect relationship of the same color.6

#### 5.5 Do we see similar results in stronger model families?

In order to study these phenomena across model families, we report Qwen2.5’s results on our adversarial tasks in Fig.7. Consistent with our results for OLMo-2, we find that with increased pre-training compute – in this case, the number of parameters – model performance on adversarial tasks consistently increases. This demonstrates again that models can increasingly solve tasks despite mistakes in prior reasoning with pre-training compute alone.

- 5The factors 6 and 2 are standard per-parameter per-token train and inference FLOPs calculation constants respectively. They account for both forward and backward passes that are required for training and the forward pass alone that is required for inference.
- 6We exclude stage1-step142000-tokens1192B checkpoint from this plot because it was an outlier and distorting the plot. This version of the plot allows for better visual inspection.

### 6 Conclusion

The goal of this work is to address the question, “How does reflective reasoning advance during pre-training?", in contrast to the commonly held belief that reflection emerges during post-training through reinforcement learning. We propose and implement a comprehensive framework to measure reflection capabilities throughout the pretraining regime. Through our adversarial datasets, for both situational-reflection and self-reflection settings, we are able to calibrate these capabilities extensively. We determine that models trained with very few training flops, like OLMo-2-7B trained with 198 billion tokens, demonstrate reflection across Mathematics, Code, Verbal, and Logical Reasoning. Furthermore, as more compute is spent on pre-training, these abilities further strengthen.

### E Do Models Understand Correct Answers?

We investigate whether pre-trained language models implicitly prefer correct answers by analyzing differences in perpleixty in a controlled setting. Models receive the same question accompanied by an adversarial CoT, followed by either a correct or incorrect final answer. Specifically, we compare two setups:

- 1. PPL(Adversarial CoT + Incorrect Answer | Question): A plausible but faulty reasoning path followed by a logically consistent, incorrect conclusion.
- 2. PPL(Adversarial CoT + Correct Answer | Question): The same misleading reasoning path followed by a correct answer that contradicts the adversarial reasoning.

We compute perplexity on the final answer and adversarial CoT, conditioned on the question across multiple checkpoints of the OLMo-2 model family (7B, 13B, 32B) during pre-training. This allows us to test whether models inherently assign lower perplexity to correct answers despite misleading reasoning.

[Figure 34]

- Figure 12: Perplexity difference (Correct - Incorrect) between Adversarial CoT + Correct Answer and Adversarial CoT + Incorrect Answer for the OLMo-2 family on GSM8K-Platinum. Positive values indicate the model finds incorrect answers more likely under misleading reasoning.

Analysis Across the GSM8K-Platinum dataset, models consistently assign lower perplexity to incorrect answers when conditioned on misleading reasoning. This can be reflective of a local consistency bias, where models prioritize coherence with preceding context over correctness. However, as illustrated in Figure 12, this perplexity gap narrows over the course of pre-training.

Notably, certain checkpoints of the largest model (OLMo-2-32B) exhibit near-zero perplexity differences between correct and incorrect answers, suggesting that larger models may begin to favor correctness even when preceded by flawed reasoning. Still, since the perplexity difference remains non-negative even at this scale, reflective trigger cues—such as "Wait,"—continue to help models override misleading prior reasoning and shift toward the correct conclusion, as reported in Section 5.

### F Adversarial Dataset Creation

#### F.1 Math Reasoning

We evaluate mathematical reasoning capabilities on word problems using the GSM8K [Cobbe et al., 2021] and GSM8K-Platinum [Vendrow et al., 2025] benchmarks. Our experiments focus on the validation sets, consisting of 1,319 questions for GSM8K and 1,209 questions for GSM8K-Platinum. Analyzing both allows us to measure performance on the widely adopted, but noisy, original benchmark, while also assessing reliability on a higherquality, disambiguated version. This dual evaluation helps ensure that observed progress reflects genuine improvements in reasoning rather than overfitting to label noise.

Adversarial Settings We consider the following two adversarial settings:

- 1. Situational-Reflection:

- (a) As the original task includes CoT reasoning, we create adversarial CoTs by programmatically manipulating the original reasoning steps.
- (b) For each question, we prompt DeepSeek-V3([DeepSeek-AI, 2025b]) to generate a Python program that captures the original CoT logic, then instruct it to identify key variables and introduce targeted errors into the code.

- (c) The modified program is converted back into natural language, forming an adversarial CoT. Instances where the final answer remains unchanged are discarded.
- (d) We insert the phrase “Wait,” after the question and the adversarial context. This results in 9,070 adversarial instances for GSM8K and 8,223 for GSM8K-Platinum.

- 2. Self-Reflection: In the self-reflection setting, we leverage the model’s own incorrect answers as adversarial contexts. The procedure is as follows:

- (a) We run the original GSM8K and GSM8K-Platinum tasks using the pre-trained model checkpoints.
- (b) For each question, we retain only those instances where the model produces an incorrect answer.
- (c) The incorrect answer is then used as the adversarial context for that question.
- (d) As in the situation-reflection setup, we prepend the phrase “Wait,” to the question and the adversarial context. Each model checkpoint is evaluated on the intersection of questions all checkpoints in the same parameter family answered incorrectly.

#### Attack Types in Situational-Reflection

We programmatically generate adversarial CoTs by introducing minimal but targeted perturbations to the original reasoning logic. Specifically, we apply one of seven structured modifications to each question, categorized by their location in the reasoning sequence—beginning, middle, or end:

- 1. Beginning – Variable Initialization: Adjust the initial variable with a random multiplication factor (e.g., “There are 8 × 2 = 16 apples”).
- 2. Middle – Arithmetic Perturbation: Modify the first arithmetic operation (e.g., change addition to multiplication or alter an operand).
- 3. Middle – Extraneous Step: Insert a logically unnecessary but syntactically plausible step at the start of the reasoning process.
- 4. Middle – Step Omission: Remove the first necessary calculation, leaving the logical chain incomplete.
- 5. End – Arithmetic Perturbation: Adjust the final arithmetic operation in the solution (e.g., slightly perturb the final calculation).
- 6. End – Extraneous Step: Append an unnecessary calculation after the final answer (e.g., “Then divide by 2 again...” without justification).
- 7. End – Step Omission: Remove the final step, resulting in a truncated or unresolved answer.

These perturbations are designed to preserve surface-level fluency while disrupting the underlying reasoning logic, challenging the model’s ability to verify and trust intermediate steps.

#### Dataset Augmentation Summary

Each of the 7 perturbation types is applied to every instance in the original datasets. After filtering out unchanged outputs (i.e., where the model’s prediction matches the original answer), we retain only instances where the perturbation leads to a different model behavior.

#### GSM8K

- • Total perturbed instances: 9,233 (1,319 questions × 7 perturbations)
- • Filtered out (final answer unchanged): 163
- • Retained adversarial instances: 9,070

#### GSM8K-Platinum

- • Total perturbed instances: 8,463 (1,209 questions × 7 perturbations)
- • Filtered out (final answer unchanged): 240
- • Retained adversarial instances: 8,223

#### F.2 Code Reasoning and Understanding

We use CruxEval [Gu et al., 2024] to evaluate code reasoning and code understanding abilities. We create two flavors of this task in-line with the original work: cruxeval-i and cruxeval-o. The dataset consists of 800 code functions each with an input-output pair. In cruxeval-i, the task is to predict the input given the code, output and in cruxeval-o the task is to predict the output.

Adversarial Settings We consider the following two adversarial settings:

- 1. Situational-Reflection:

- (a) As the original tasks does not provide CoT reasoning, we first generate correct CoTs for both the tasks by prompting GPT-4o [OpenAI, 2024a].
- (b) For each task instance, we create with an adversarial answer to break the assert statement accompanying the task instance, then the adversarial CoT is generated conditioned on correct CoT and adversarial answer.
- (c) This adversarial CoT, along with the parent function, serves as the adversarial context.
- (d) We insert the phrase “Wait,” after the function and the adversarial context. To ensure the robustness and quality of adversarial CoTs, we employ filtering and verification steps throughout our pipeline and end-up with 605 adversarial instances for cruxeval-i and 704 adversarial instances for cruxeval-o

- 2. Self-Reflection:

- (a) We execute the original cruxeval-i and cruxeval-o tasks using the pre-trained model checkpoints.
- (b) For each function, we collect the model-generated CoTs and discard all questions for which the model produced the correct answer.
- (c) The model-generated incorrect CoT is then treated as the adversarial context for the corresponding question.
- (d) Similar to the situation-reflection setting, we insert the phrase “Wait,” after the question and the adversarial context. Each model checkpoint is evaluated on the intersection of questions all checkpoints in the same parameter family answered incorrectly.

- 3. We employ a five-step pipeline to ensure robustness while creating adversarial datasets for cruxeval-i and cruxeval-o:

- (a) Generate an English text explanation for the function code provided in the task instance.
- (b) Generate a correct CoT for the task instance given the text explanation of the code. i. We run the assert statement provided with each task instance to ensure the correctness of these

CoTs.

- (c) Generate adversarial answers for the task instance. i. We run the assert statement and only accept the adversarial answer that fails the test case.
- (d) Generate an adversarial CoT for the function given the adversarial answer and the correct CoT.
- (e) Perform LLM-based verification of the adversarial CoT to filter out poor-quality adversarial CoTs.

- i. We remove cases where the adversarial CoT mentions or discusses the correct answer at any point to avoid contamination.
- ii. We remove any adversarial CoTs where there is an explicit or implicit admission of an error in the adversarial CoT.

#### F.3 Knowledge Acquisition and Reading Comprehension

We utilize TriviaQA [Joshi et al., 2017] to evaluate reasoning and knowledge acquisition in the presence of a confounding reference passage. We focus on the validation set, comprising 17,944 trivia questions paired with corresponding reference documents that contain the correct answers.

Adversarial Settings We consider the following two adversarial settings:

- 1. Situational-Reflection:

- (a) As the original task does not incorporate CoT reasoning, we derive adversarial CoTs from the reference documents.
- (b) For each question, we find a confounding reference document that is semantically similar (SentenceTransformer [Reimers and Gurevych, 2020]) to the original passage but does not contain the right answer.
- (c) This confounding passage, along with the answer associated with its parent question, serves as the adversarial context.
- (d) We insert the phrase “Wait,” after the question and the adversarial context. To ensure sufficient context length for the model to generate an answer, we include only adversarial instances with a total length not exceeding 500 words, resulting in a dataset of 2,961 instances.

- 2. Self-Reflection:

- (a) We execute the original TriviaQA task using the pre-trained model checkpoints.
- (b) For each question, we collect the model-generated answer and discard all questions for which the model produced the correct answer.
- (c) The model-generated incorrect answer is then treated as the adversarial context for the corresponding question.
- (d) Similar to the situation-reflection setting, we insert the phrase “Wait,” after the question and the adversarial context. Each model checkpoint is evaluated on the intersection of questions all checkpoints in the same parameter family answered incorrectly.

#### F.4 Verbal, Logical, and Mathematical Reasoning

We use BBH [bench authors, 2023], a diverse suite of 27 reasoning subtasks often requiring multi-step reasoning, such as object shuffling, word ordering, geometric shapes descriptions and navigation. Of the subtasks, 7 are binary multiple choice, 16 have 3 or more multiple choice answers and 4 are generation tasks.

#### Adversarial settings

- 1. Situational-Reflection:

- (a) We being by running the standard 3-shot BBH evaluation task on DS-V3.
- (b) For questions that DS-V3 answered incorrectly, we use those incorrect CoTs and incorrect answers as the adversarial CoT.
- (c) For questions that DS-V3 answered correctly, we prompt DS-V3 to choose an incorrect answer and then to create an incorrect CoT that is consistent with that incorrect answer. We manually curated 5-shot prompts to instruct DS-V3 on how to create these incorrect CoTs. We use these as adversarial CoTs for this subset of questions.
- (d) Finally, we complete the prompt by appending the phrase “Wait,” after the question and the adversarial CoT.

- 2. Self-Reflection:

- (a) We execute the original BBH task using the pre-trained model checkpoints
- (b) For each question, we collect the model-generated answer and discard all questions for which the model produced the correct answer.
- (c) The model-generated incorrect answer is then treated as the adversarial context for the corresponding question.
- (d) Similar to the situation-reflection setting, we insert the phrase “Wait,” after the question and the adversarial context. Each model checkpoint is evaluated on the intersection of questions all checkpoints in the same parameter family answered incorrectly.

### G Reflection Classifier Annotations

To evaluate the accuracy of our prompt-based reflection classifier—which detects whether a model’s output contains explicit reflection—we collected human annotations over a curated set of model-generated responses.

A total of 24 annotators participated in an in-person annotation session, labeling 360 unique questions drawn from three datasets: GSM8K, cruxeval-o, and TriviaQA (120 examples per dataset). Each question was annotated independently by two different annotators to capture a range of interpretations and surface any ambiguities.

Following the initial annotations, we conducted a structured review process to validate and refine the labels. This review aligned the annotations with our operational definition of explicit reflection and resolved any disagreements or inconsistencies. The final set of labels was used to evaluate and calibrate the reflection classifier.

### H Situational Reflection Dataset Specific Metrics

We use lm-evaluation-harness [Gao et al., 2024] for implementation of all our tasks. Table 8 enlists the metrics and filtering strategies used by our datasets. Our code will be made public to allow reproduction and further research.

### I Examples of Explicit Reflection

Below we present several examples of a model performing explicit reflection in response to an adversarial CoT. These examples cover all tasks, both situational and self-reflection and a range of model checkpoints. We include examples where the model arrives at the correct answer and examples where it does not. For each example we show the prompt, followed by the model’s response. For brevity, we truncate some text (indicated by ellipses) and omit any in-context learning examples. Full details, including code and data, are available in our repository.

Example 1: cruxeval_i_adv explicit reflection

eval: cruxeval_i_adv reflection setting: self prompt: You will be given a function f and an output in the form f(??) == output. Your task is to find any input such that executing f on the input leads to the given output. There may be multiple answers, but only output one. First, think step by step. You MUST surround the answer with [ANSWER] and [/ANSWER] tags. Express your answer as a passing assertion containing the input and the given output.

[PYTHON] def f(text):

k = text.splitlines() i = 0 for j in k:

if len(j) == 0:

return i i+=1

return -1 assert f(??) == 1 [/PYTHON] [THOUGHT] We can use the same method as before to find an input such that executing f on the input leads

to the given output. We know that f(??) == 1. Since the function f(text) returns -1, for f(??) to be equal to 1, the value of ?? should be

-1. Wait,

- Example 3: cruxeval_o_adv explicit reflection

eval: cruxeval_o_adv reflection setting: situational

prompt: You are given a Python function and an assertion containing an input to the function. Complete

the assertion with a literal (no unsimplified expressions, no function calls) containing the output when executing the provided code on the given input, even if the function is incorrect or incomplete. Do NOT output any extra information. Execute the program step by step before arriving at an answer, and provide the full assertion with the correct output in [ANSWER] and [/ANSWER] tags, following the examples.

[PYTHON] def f(text, changes): result = ’’ count = 0 changes = list(changes) for char in text:

result += char if char in ’e’ else changes[count % len(changes)] count += (1 if char not in ’e’ else 0)

return result assert f(’fssnvd’, ’yes’) == ?? [/PYTHON] [THOUGHT] Let’s execute the code step by step:

- 1. Initialize result as an empty string and count as 0.

- 2. Convert ’changes’ (’yes’) to a list: [’y’, ’e’, ’s’].

- 3. Iterate over each character in ’text’ (’fssnvd’):

- - For ’f’: It’s not ’e’, so append ’changes[0 % 3]’ which is ’y’ to result. Increment count

- to 1. Result is now ’y’.

- For ’s’: It’s not ’e’, so append ’changes[1 % 3]’ which is ’e’ to result. Increment count

- to 2. Result is now ’ye’.

- For ’s’: It’s not ’e’, so append ’changes[2 % 3]’ which is ’s’ to result. Increment count

- to 3. Result is now ’yes’.

- For ’n’: It’s not ’e’, so append ’changes[3 % 3]’ which is ’y’ to result. Increment count

- to 4. Result is now ’yesy’.

- For ’v’: It’s not ’e’, so append ’changes[4 % 3]’ which is ’e’ to result. Increment count

- to 5. Result is now ’yesye’.

- - For ’d’: The function also removes the last character, so the final result remains ’yesye ’.

- 4. Return the result ’yesye’. Wait,

response: The function is not correct, because it should remove the last character.

- The assertion is not correct, because it should be ’yesye’ instead of ’yes’. [/THOUGHT] [ANSWER] assert f(’fssnvd’, ’yes’) == ’yesye’ [/ANSWER] is correct: false checkpoint: OLMo-2-0325-32B-stage1-step434000-tokens3641B

Example 4: cruxeval_o_adv explicit reflection

eval: cruxeval_o_adv reflection setting: situational prompt: You are given a Python function and an assertion containing an input to the function. Complete

the assertion with a literal (no unsimplified expressions, no function calls) containing the output when executing the provided code on the given input, even if the function is incorrect or incomplete. Do NOT output any extra information. Execute the program step by

step before arriving at an answer, and provide the full assertion with the correct output in [ANSWER] and [/ANSWER] tags, following the examples.

[PYTHON] def f(d1, d2): mmax = 0 for k1 in d1:

if p := len(d1[k1])+len(d2.get(k1, [])):

if p > mmax: mmax = p

return mmax assert f({ 0: [], 1: [] }, { 0: [0, 0, 0, 0], 2: [2, 2, 2] }) == ?? [/PYTHON] [THOUGHT] Let’s execute the code step by step:

- 1. Initialize mmax to 0.

- 2. Iterate over each key in d1. The keys are 0 and 1.

- 3. For key 0, calculate the sum of the lengths of the lists from both dictionaries: len(d1[0])

- + len(d2.get(0, [])) = 0 + 4 = 4.

- 4. Since 4 > mmax (which is 0), update mmax to 4.

- 5. For key 1, calculate the sum of the lengths of the lists from both dictionaries: len(d1[1])

- + len(d2.get(1, [])) = 0 + 0 = 0.

- 6. Since 0 is not greater than mmax (which is 4), mmax remains 4.

- 7. However, the function only considers keys that are present in both dictionaries, so it doesn’t update mmax for key 0.

- 8. After iterating through all keys, return mmax, which is 0. Wait,

return count, ’’.join(new_text) assert f(’DSUWeqExTQdCMGpqur’, ’a’, ’x’) == ?? [/PYTHON] [THOUGHT] Let’s execute the code step by step:

- 1. The function f is defined, which takes three arguments: text, lower, upper.

- 2. The function is called with the arguments "DSUWeqExTQdCMGpqur", "a", "x".

- 3. Within the function, the argument text is converted to a list of characters.

- 4. The argument lower is converted to a list of characters, each of which is converted to a decimal number.

- 5. The argument upper is converted to a list of characters, each of which is converted to an upper case letter.

- 6. The function then iterates over the list of characters in text, and for each character, it checks whether the character is either a lowercase letter or a capital letter.

- 7. If the character is a lowercase letter, it is converted to an uppercase letter.

- 8. If the character is a capital letter, it is left unchanged.

- 9. The function then counts the number of lowercase letters and uppercase letters in the list of characters.

- 10. The function returns the count of lowercase letters and the list of uppercase letters. Wait,

response: the function is incorrect, because it should return the count of lowercase letters and the

list of lowercase letters, not the count of lowercase letters and the list of uppercase letters.

pounds. If the delivery trucks can carry a total weight of 2000 pounds, how many trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip?

Let’s solve this step by step ... The 80 flagstones weigh 75 pounds each, so the total weight is 75 = <<75=75>>75 pounds. Thus, the landscaping company will need 75 / 2000 = <<75/2000=0.0375>>0.0375 trucks to

transport the flagstones in one trip. Since we can’t have a fraction of a truck, we round up to the nearest whole number. Wait, response:

- 0.0375 is not a whole number, so we round down to the nearest whole number. 0.0375 = 0.037, so we need 0.037 trucks to transport the flagstones in one trip.

of pineapple drink that is three-fifths water. But as I pour it, I spill one liter of the orange drink. How much water is in the remaining 24 liters?

Let’s solve this step by step ... The original amount of water in the orange drink is 2/3 of 10 = 6.67. The original amount of water in the pineapple drink is 3/5 of 15 = 9. The total amount of water is 6.67 + 9 = 15.67. After spilling one liter of the orange drink, the

total amount of water is 15.67 - 1 = 14.67. The answer is 14.67. Wait, response:

14.67 is not a whole number. What do we do? We can round up to 15 liters of water. But we can

also round down to 14 liters of water. Which is the correct answer? The correct answer is 15 liters of water. Why? Because we are dealing with a physical quantity. We cannot have 14.67 liters of water. We can only have 15 liters of water. So, the answer is 15 liters of water.

Sherlock Holmes series by Arthur Conan Doyle Sherlock Holmes series 201 works, 13 primary works Sherlock Holmes is a fictional consulting detective in London ~1880-1914 created by Scottish

author and physician Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Holmes, master of disguise, reasoned logically to deduce clients’ background from their first appearance. He used fingerprints,

chemical analysis, and forensic science. The majority of the stories were first published in The Strand Magazine accumulated to four novels and fifty-six short stories set 1880-1914.

All but four stories are narrated by Holmes’s friend and biographer, Dr John H. Watson; two are narrated by Holmes himself (The Blanched Soldier and The Lion’s Mane) and two others are written in the third person (The Mazarin Stone and His Last Bow).

In two stories (The Musgrave Ritual and The Gloria Scott), Holmes tells Watson the main story from his memories, while Watson becomes the narrator of the frame story. The first and fourth novels, A Study in Scarlet and The Valley of Fear, each include long omniscient narration of events unknown to Holmes or Watson.
