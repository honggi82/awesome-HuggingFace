Figure 1. Flexible compute allocation with ELIT. Starting from a vanilla DiT, we add a variable-length set of latent tokens—the latent interface—and two lightweight cross-attention layers, Read and Write. At inference, the number of latent tokens is a user-controlled knob that yields a smooth quality–FLOPs trade-off across DiT, U-ViT, HDiT, and MM-DiT backbones.

#### Abstract

Diffusion transformers (DiTs) achieve high generative quality but lock FLOPs to image resolution, limiting principled latency-quality trade-offs, and allocate computation uniformly across input spatial tokens, wasting resource allocation to unimportant regions. We introduce Elastic Latent Interface Transformer (ELIT), a drop-in, DiT-compatible mechanism that decouples input image size from compute. Our approach inserts a latent interface, a learnable variable-length token sequence on which standard transformer blocks can operate. Lightweight Read and Write cross-attention layers move information between spatial tokens and latents and prioritize important input regions. By training with random dropping of tail latents, ELIT learns to produce importance-ordered representations with earlier latents capturing global structure while later ones contain information to refine details. At inference, the number of latents can be dynamically adjusted to match compute constraints. ELIT is deliberately minimal, adding two cross-attention layers while leaving the rectified flow

objective and the DiT stack unchanged. Across datasets and architectures (DiT, U-ViT, HDiT, MM-DiT), ELIT delivers consistent gains. On ImageNet-1K 512px, ELIT delivers an average gain of 35.3% and 39.6% in FID and FDD scores.

#### 1. Introduction

Recent years have seen dramatic progress in image and video generation. Owing to the simplicity of their design, architectures centered on Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) [45] have scaled reliably and delivered state-of-theart fidelity [19, 54, 56]. Compute has been the primary determinant of generation quality, but continued scaling has inflated training and inference costs. This raises a central question: do DiTs utilize available computation effectively? We argue that such costs are amplified by the rigidity in the DiT design. First, a DiT typically commits to a perstep computational cost that is a fixed function of the input resolution, without accounting for latency and compute constraints. Second, we found that DiT allocates computation uniformly across image regions. In a controlled experiment, we probe the ability of a DiT to use extra compute to improve generation quality. As expected, quality

improves on standard images when we increase the number of tokens by reducing the patchification size. However, when we increase the number of tokens by padding encoded image patches with zero-valued patches, we find that DiT fails to leverage the extra computation to improve generation quality. These observations suggest that compute is spent uniformly across image tokens. This is suboptimal since visual information in images is uneven: some regions are easy, others require more work. In this context, learning how to allocate computation across tokens through a flexible architecture holds the potential to dynamically reduce unnecessary computation.

Important previous work has sought forms of flexibility to make generative models more efficient. Adaptive generators allow a single model to operate at different budgets, but still spread computation uniformly across tokens [1, 62] or suffer from high complexity [64]. Masking-based methods improve training speed by skipping tokens. Yet, dropping is disabled for inference to avoid unrecoverable information loss [17, 33], making inference compute unchanged. On the other hand, some training-free acceleration approaches reduce the computation for the least informative tokens during inference, leaving the training efficacy the same [28, 41, 59]. A complementary thread moves flexibility in the autoencoder by learning variable-length representations but stops short of endowing a generative model with an internal flexible representation [2, 36]. Finally, RINs [12, 26] learn to distribute computation nonuniformly across input tokens through a set of latent tokens, but keep inference budget fixed and depart significantly from the DiT architecture, hindering adoption.

Building on the previous observations, we propose Elastic Latent Interface Transformer (ELIT) (see Figure 1), a minimal, DiT-compatible mechanism for representationand-compute adaptivity. We introduce two lightweight cross-attention layers, Read and Write, that equip DiT-like architectures with a set of latent tokens we refer to as latent interface. These latent tokens act as a variable-size surface onto which to distribute input information in a flexible and learnable manner based on the difficulty of each region. Read pulls information from input tokens, which we will refer to as spatial, into the latent interface, prioritizing challenging regions. Write broadcasts updated latents back to the spatial tokens. Importantly, the number of latent tokens is user-controlled, directly setting the per-step compute budget. No changes to the training objective are necessary.

We provide a thorough analysis of ELIT, showing that it successfully redistributes compute non-uniformly across input tokens across varying base architectures. Our latent interface consistently improves over a fixed-grid model with ImageNet-1k 512px FDD (Fr´echet Distance on DINOv2 [44] features), improving 58.0% for DiT, 34.0% for U-ViT, 37.4% for HDiT. ELIT also allows for graceful

compute-quality tradeoffs by selecting the number of latent tokens at inference time, regularly achieving better tradeoffs than sampling steps reduction while being compatible with training-free acceleration techniques [39]. Additionally, variable compute enables autoguidance [30] out of the box, which reduces inference cost by ≈ 33% without affecting the generation quality. In summary, this simple addition yields a framework capable of: (I) Adaptive computation. Compute is concentrated where it matters rather than spread uniformly across input regions. (II) Variable test-time compute. A single set of weights serves a spectrum of latency-quality points by selecting the number of latent tokens. (III) Improved sampling. Variable compute enables autoguidance [30] out of the box. (IV) Drop-in training. We keep the design simple, retaining the vanilla rectified-flow objective and showing our method’s applicability to DiT, U-ViT, HDiT, and MMDiT. Implementation amounts to only adding the Read and Write layers and latent tokens sampling during training.

#### 2. Related Work

Adaptive generators for inference budget control. Supernetwork trains a single set of weights to support many sub-networks, allowing test-time accuracy–efficiency tradeoffs [5, 62]. Other works train transformers with multiple patchification sizes for variable compute budgets [1, 38]. [64] uses learnable routers to adjust network width and drop tokens in MLPs. These methods differ in where adaptivity lives but share the goal of a single model that gracefully scales compute at inference time. Our method adopts a simple variable-length latent interface, improving model convergence and enabling control over the inference budget. Token dropping for training speedup. Another direction accelerates model training by skipping tokens. MaskDiT [65] restructures DiTs as an encoder-decoder model and randomly drops encoder input while using an auxiliary reconstruction objective. MDTv2 [17] similarly leverages masked latent modeling to train on partial inputs. TREAD [33] randomly selects a set of tokens that skip computation of all blocks from a predefined start to an end DiT block index. However, due to the destructive nature of token dropping, such methods typically rely on auxiliary losses [65], full-token post-training [33, 65], and adopt fulltoken inference [17, 33, 65], limiting acceleration during inference. Our method speeds up convergence while enabling control over inference budget by selecting variable amounts of tokens, without applying auxiliary losses.

Latent interfaces. Latent tokens have been used as compact representations in several architectures. Neural Turing Machines [18] employed them as memory, while Perceiver [27] used cross-attention to condense highdimensional inputs. In generative models, RINs [26] and FITs [12] introduced interleaved read/write operations for

- Figure 2. Adaptive computation. We test whether DiT and ELIT-DiT can reallocate compute across image regions by training on synthetic inputs formed by zero-padding real images, artificially increasing the token count (◆). We compare its performance to baselines trained on real data using patch size 2×2 and patch size 1×1 (★). Vanilla DiT does not improve: attention in zeroed regions targets other zeroed regions (see “DiT Attention”), so extra tokens raise cost without benefits. In contrast, ELIT-DiT uses the Read layer to pull informative spatial tokens into the latent interface (see “Read Attention”), effectively filtering out zeroed areas (see “ELIT-DiT Attention”). Consequently, it leverages the larger token budget and matches the real-data baseline at equal FLOPs.

efficient high-dimensional synthesis, which was later scaled to video generation [43]. Despite their efficiency, such designs diverge from DiTs and often require specialized optimizers (e.g., LAMB [61]). Similarly, TiTok [63] applied latent tokens as bottlenecks in autoencoders, and recent work extends this to variable-length token sets via tail dropping [2, 32, 36, 58]. Our work brings variable-length latent interfaces to generative models, integrating seamlessly into DiTs with only lightweight Read and Write layers.

#### 3. Method

We propose Elastic Latent Interface Transformer (ELIT) (see Figure 3), a novel approach that enables flexible compute allocation in DiT-like transformers. The core component is a variable-length set of latent tokens—the latent interface—where most transformer blocks operate. Two lightweight cross-attention layers, Read and Write, pass information between domains: Read pulls content from spatial tokens into the latent interface, prioritizing harder regions, while Write broadcasts the updated latent state back to the spatial domain. Unlike the spatial domain, where model FLOPs are a fixed function of input resolution, the latent interface is trained with random tail token dropping, making it resizable. The length of this latent interface during inference directly adjusts FLOPs for each model call.

Section 3.1 reviews Flow Matching, Section 3.2 presents a motivating experiment, Section 3.3 details the architecture, and Section 3.4 describes training and sampling.

##### 3.1. Preliminaries: Flow Matching

We train our generators with the Rectified Flow (RF) variant of flow matching [37, 40], which learns a deterministic velocity field connecting a noise distribution pn to the data

distribution pd. Let X1 ∼ pd and X0 ∼ pn = N(0,I). A linear path is defined as Xt = (1−t)X0+tX1,t ∈ [0,1], whose ground-truth velocity is constant along the path: vt = dX

dt = X1 − X0. A neural network G(·) predicts the velocity from a noised input and time and is optimized as:

t

LRF = Et∼pt, X1∼pd, X0∼pn G(Xt, t) − (X1 − X0) 22, (1)

where pt is a logit-normal [15] training distribution over t. At inference, samples are obtained by integrating the learned ODE from X0 to X1 with a standard solver.

##### 3.2. Uniform Spatial Computation in DiTs

Standard DiTs operate in the spatial domain where an input Xt at time t is patchified by a linear projection layer into N tokens and processed by B transformer blocks. Each block output is connected to the previous block through a residual connection at the same spatial location, maintaining a fixed mapping between tokens s in intermediate blocks and corresponding spatial location of Xt. This results in a uniform compute distribution across spatial locations in Xt.

We probe this behavior through an experiment presented in Figure 2. We train DiT-B/2 (i.e., 2×2 patchification) and a corresponding DiT-B/1 (i.e., 1×1 patchification) on ImageNet-1k. As expected, performance improves in DiTB/1 due to the fourfold amount of tokens. We then introduce a synthetic ImageNet-1k version by padding encoded images with zeros, yielding four times more tokens. We train a DiT-B/2, named DiT-B/2-Synth, without loss on padded regions. We also use absolute learnable positional encodings to avoid bias toward zero patches. For evaluation, we remove padded regions before decoding to recover real image content. DiT-B/2-Synth matches the number of tokens and FLOPs of DiT-B/1. Thus, if compute were used effectively, it should match DiT-B/1 performance. Instead, as

- Figure 3. Architecture of ELIT. We extend a DiT-like generator with a variable-length set of latent tokens—the latent interface—and lightweight Read/Write cross-attention layers. A short spatial DiT head processes patchified inputs; Read pulls information into the latent domain where core blocks operate. Write broadcasts updated latents back to spatial tokens, and a small spatial tail produce output. Spatial tokens and latents are partitioned into corresponding groups, with cross-attention operate only within groups. During training, we randomly drop tail latents, yielding an importance-ordered interface. At inference, the number of latents serves as a user-controlled compute knob.

shown in Figure 2, DiT-B/2-Synth matches DiT-B/2 in FID, indicating no benefit from the added compute.

Attention maps in Figure 2 reveal that in DiT-B/2-Synth, zeroed tokens primarily attend to each other instead of important image regions, wasting compute. We conclude that DiT cannot reallocate computation from easy to hard regions. Such inefficiency likely also arises in natural images, where spatial regions vary in difficulty (lower or higher losses) and would benefit from compute redistribution.

##### 3.3. Elastic Latent Interface Transformer

From spatial tokens to a variable latent interface. To allow flexible distribution of computation in DiTs, we introduce a minimal change that eliminates the fixed mapping between tokens and image patches, as shown in Figure 3. We create a latent domain by instantiating a latent interface of K tokens. To map the original spatial domain to the new latent domain, we use a lightweight Read cross-attention layer, following [12], which enables the model to select the number of latent tokens adaptively for each spatial region of Xt, based on their difficulty. This forms a compact latent domain on which most transformer blocks operate. Finally, a lightweight Write cross-attention layer maps the latent updates back to the spatial grid, allowing the model to write predictions back to their locations and retain input details.

Architecture. Earlier work has shown that early and late transformer blocks in diffusion models exhibit different specializations compared to the intermediate blocks [10, 11, 55]. Therefore, we split transformer blocks into three segments:

- 1. Short spatial head (Bin blocks). Processes input tokens s∈RN×d to produce a refined spatial representation which is transferred to the latent interface. This avoids reading from raw noisy patches.
- 2. Latent core (Bcore blocks). Variable-length latent sequence l ∈ RK×d drives most computation. We insert a Read layer R that pulls information from spatial to-

kens into l, then process l with standard transformer blocks in the latent domain, and finally insert a Write layer W that broadcasts updated latent information back to the spatial domain.

3. Short spatial tail (Bout blocks). A few blocks complete processing the written features and project them to the output velocity. This head restores fine spatial detail, noise information, and aligns features to the prediction space of vˆ.

Read and Write layers. Let s ∈ RN×d be the current spatial tokens after the spatial head and l ∈ RK×d a learnable set of initial latent tokens. The Read layer updates the latent interface via cross-attention from spatial tokens, producing output latents lO ∈ RK×d as follows:

lCA = l + CA Queries = l; Keys, Values = s , lO = lCA + MLP(lCA).

(2)

Conversely, the Write layer updates the spatial representation with the results of latent computations, producing updated spatial tokens sO ∈ RN×d and is fully symmetric. We adopt pre-norm, and use adaLN-Zero [45] modulation for Read to keep the interface timestep-aware. To improve stability, we apply QK normalization inside cross-attention operations. No hidden dimensionality expansion is applied to the MLP blocks to reduce the computational overhead.

Grouped cross-attention. To reduce the cost of Read and Write operations, we partition spatial tokens into G non-overlapping groups (e.g., a regular 2D/3D grid for images/videos), and latents are partitioned accordingly in groups of J = K/G latent tokens each. Latents are initialized from a set of learnable positional embeddings, which is reused across groups and encodes positional information within each group. This removes any dependency on a fixed input resolution: increasing spatial resolution modifies G and N, but not the number of learnable latents J. Cross attention operations attend within corresponding groups only. This turns the cross-attention cost from

that any prefix of J˜<=J tokens of the group tokens yields a valid interface associated with reduced computation (see Appendix Section K). We enforce this with a simple random prefix-keeping scheme as in [48]. At training time, we randomly sample J˜∼ Uniform{Jmin,...,Jmax} once per training iteration, defining the training budget for the current iteration. The same value of J˜is used across all groups. In every Read/Write and latent-core block, we keep only the first J˜ latents of each group and drop the subsequent tail. This process creates a consistent hierarchy where head latents are seen (and trained on) more often, forcing the model into storing the most important information in earlier latents. The generator is trained end-to-end only with the standard RF loss in Equation (1).

Asymmetric compute for improved guidance. Classifierfree guidance (CFG) [22] is a cornerstone technique in diffusion model sampling. Given a conditioning signal c and guidance scale λ, CFG redefines the velocity prediction vˆCFG = (λ+1)G(Xt | c)−λG(Xt | ∅). While improving the quality, this comes at the cost of duplicating the number of model invocations. Recently, AutoGuidance (AG) [30] was proposed to improve guidance by replacing the unconditional model with a weak version of itself. While producing consistent improvements, it relies on the availability of a weaker model version, ideally producing artifacts that are similar to the main model [9]. Weak models are separately trained or obtained through handcrafted model corruptions [9, 23, 25]. However, in our multi-budget framework, such model is natively available by varying the inference budget defined by J˜. Thus, we evaluate the main term with budget J˜ and the guidance term with a smaller budget J˜w ≤ J˜. We find, however, that AG degrades metrics that reward class alignment, such as Inception Score. We thus opt to drop the class condition from the guidance term, combining the power of AG and CFG, and name the resulting guidance mechanism cheap classifier-free guidance (CCFG). The guidance mechanisms are defined as:

##### 3.4. Elastic Computation with ELIT

Spatial compute redistribution. When integrated with DiT (ELIT-DiT), our architecture enables spatial compute redistribution. In the synthetic dataset experiment described in Section 3.2, ELIT-DiT-B/2-Synth repurposes the compute from zeroed regions to enhance generation in real regions, matching the quality of the baseline trained only on the original ImageNet-1k with equivalent compute(ELITDiT-B/1) (see Figure 2). Attention maps of the read operations averaged over all latent tokens confirm this behavior, showing that ELIT-DiT builds its latent representation by focusing on the most informative spatial regions with the highest flow-matching loss.

Multi-budget elastic latent interface. We aim to build a multi-budget model that supports variable inference budgets. Since each latent token summarizes its group information via the read operation, a subset of tokens can still predict for the entire group, enabling budget-adaptive inference. Thus, we train an importance-ordered latent interface, where earlier tokens within each group capture globally useful information and later tokens refine details, so

This results in both improved quality and a reduced cost without any retraining or handcrafted model corruptions.

When paired with classifier-free guidance (CFG), denoted as cheap CFG (CCFG), it reduces overall generation cost by ≈ 33% while improving quality. Compared to DiT, ELIT-DiT achieves a 19% better best FID.

We demonstrate ELIT’s broad applicability by evaluating it on several popular diffusion backbones: DiT [45], UViT [3], and HDiT [13]. To ensure a fair comparison and evaluate architectural advantages in isolation, all baselines are built with the same base transformer blocks, adopt the same RF framework, and have similar train compute. Furthermore, we integrate several improvements across all baselines, including RoPE [51], and QK normalization [15]. Training details. We perform conditional image and video generation on ImageNet-1k [14] and Kinetics-700 [6], respectively. We train on 256px and 512px resolutions for ImageNet-1k experiments and use 29 frames, at 24 fps and 256px resolution for Kinetics-700. We use the FLUX [34] autoencoder for images and the CogVideo [60] autoencoder for videos. Main experiments are based on DiT-XL/2, while ablation studies use a DiT-B/2 model. Unless noted, we use a batch size of 256, learning rate 1×10−4 with 10k warmup steps, gradient clipping at 1.0, Adam [31], and EMA with β = 0.9999. Image experiments are trained for 500k steps, while video experiments are trained for 200k steps.

Evaluation metrics and protocol. We follow the evaluation protocol of [20]. For images, we report FID [21], FDD (Fr´echet Distance on DINOv2 [44] features), and Inception Score (IS) [50]. For video, we report FID, FDD, and FVD [52]. Statistics are computed over 50k samples for main image experiments, while 10k samples are used for all other experiments. We use an Euler sampler with 40 steps unless otherwise noted. We use FLOPs to measure the amount of computation in all experiments and show in Appendix the relationship between FLOPs and forward time.

Image generation. To disentangle the effect of dynamic compute redistribution from multi-budget training, we evaluate two variants for each baseline: ELIT, trained with a single budget matching the baselines configurations, and ELIT-MB, trained in a multi-budget setup following the tail-token dropping strategy from Section 3.4. This yields 60 budgets at 512px and 16 budgets at 256px. To account for the compute saved at shorter token lengths, we increase the batch size to 384, keeping training FLOPs comparable. We report per-iteration FLOPs for all baselines.

##### 4.2. Comparison to baselines

Baseline selection and details. We use DiT [45] as a base architecture for our experiments and consider two variants: U-ViT and HDiT. U-ViT [3] adds long skip connections akin to U-Net [49]. We add ELIT read/write operations while keeping the U-ViT design untouched to obtain ELIT-U-ViT. HDiT [13] reduces tokens in intermediate blocks via PixelUnshuffle/PixelShuffle. We use a single 2×2 down-/up-sampling operation at blocks 8 and 20, respectively and double the bottleneck hidden dimensionality to match vanilla DiT FLOPs at the cost of an increased parameter count. We apply ELIT read/write operations and

As shown in Table 1, ELIT, despite its simplicity, improves over all baselines under similar training FLOPs. In the multi-budget setting, ELIT-MB delivers further gains, achieving sizable improvements over DiT, U-ViT, and HDiT across all metrics, with FID reductions of 40%, 14%, and 27%, respectively. We attribute these extra gains to the

per group J˜after dropping as a knob to control the budget. Sampling steps trade-off. We compare our approach for controlling inference compute against naively lowering the sampling steps. As shown in Figure 8, our method delivers a superior compute–quality trade-off to varying the step count. Notably, for each FLOP target, the optimal combination of number of steps and tokens count varies, underscoring the value of models that support a continuum of inference budgets. We also demonstrate compatibility with TeaCache [39] in Figure 9, where our method attains gains comparable to the baseline when TeaCache is applied.

Efficient model guidance. In Figure 5, we compare classifier-free guidance (CFG) with autoguidance (AG) and cheap classifier-free guidance (CCFG). Figure 6 and Appendix Section L, show qualitative examples of such guidance strategies. AG achieves comparable performance to CFG while using ≈ 33% fewer FLOPs. Combining AG with CFG by dropping the class condition in the guidance term (i.e. CCFG) gives the best results in all metrics and delivers the same ≈ 33% inference speedup.

importance ordering, which leads to better token semantics while benefiting from the larger effective batch size. The improvements are even more pronounced at 512px, where FID decreases by 53%, 28%, and 23% for DiT, U-ViT, and HDiT, respectively, suggesting that our method scales favorably with higher resolution, where pixel redundancy is greater and dynamic compute redistribution is more beneficial. We report in Figure 4 the convergence speed of ELITDiT relative to DiT at both resolutions, showing faster convergence. Figure 5 compares performance across CFG values and confirms the advantage of our method under the optimal CFG scale. Finally, Figure 6 shows qualitatively the improvements of our method over DiT. More qualitative examples are provided in Appendix Section L.

We evaluate the applicability of ELIT to large-scale generative models by applying it on top of Qwen-Image [56], which is based on a 20B MM-DiT backbone. We insert the Read and Write layers respectively after block 8 and 52. Due to the asymmetric nature of MM-DiTs and small number of text tokens (≈ 300 on average) versus 4096 image tokens at 1024px, we apply ELIT to the large image tokens stream only. Rather than outperforming the original model, a task which would require access to large-scale curated image datasets and post-training procedures matching the original ones [56], the experiment aims to demonstrate that ELIT enables stable training and multi-budget inference for large-scale MM-DiT at high resolution. Therefore, we finetune from Qwen-Image in a distillation setting. Specifically, we fine-tune for 60k steps at 512px resolution, using a com-

Video generation. We validate the performance of ELIT in class-conditional video generation and report the results in Table 2 where we apply grouping of spatial and latent tokens in the frame and temporal dimension. ELIT-DiT shows favorable results over DiT across all metrics.

Scaling across model sizes. We evaluate ELIT across model sizes from DiT-S/4 to DiT-XL/2 in Figure 7. ELIT outperforms DiT at every scale. Gains are larger for bigger models, while the relative overhead decreases, suggesting that ELIT is particularly well-suited for large-scale models.

bination of RF loss and a distillation loss scaled to a similar magnitude. We then fine-tune for an additional 60k steps at 1024px. We train on real images and synthetic ones generated from FLUX.1-Schnell [34] and SDXL [47].

We perform inference using the Euler sampler with 40 steps and CFG of 5.0 for the original method, while we use the faster CCFG with same weight for ELIT-QwenImage. Additional details are reported in Appendix Section L. Figure 1 and Appendix Figure 19 show qualitative results, where ELIT-Qwen-Image cuts sampling FLOPs by up to 63%, achieving ≈ 2.7× speedup while gracefully trading off speed for quality. On DPG-Bench [24], it maintains strong performance across different inference budgets, with the average score ranging from 90.45 to 88.02 at the lowest budget. We include original Qwen-Image results using the same sampling parameters for completeness. With respect to the original Qwen-Image, we observe an initial score gap of 0.82 average score points in our model.

##### 4.5. Ablations

Group sizes. The latent group size controls how flexibly the interface can attend over spatial tokens, with larger groups enabling more opportunities for non-uniform compute. As shown in Table 4 (a), dividing the image into 16 groups performs best across 256px and 512px resolutions. Groups of 1×1 force a rigid one-to-one, spatially aligned mapping, while 16×16 spans the full 256px image and underperforms. We hypothesize that using > 1 groups provides useful coarse spatial regularization, while still permitting intra-group compute redistribution.

Blocks allocation. We vary (Bin,Bcore,Bout) for DiT-B/2 and DiT-XL/2 in Table 4 (b) (i.e., the head, latent core, and tail blocks count). Optimal results occur when ≈ 67% and ≈71% of blocks are in the latent core, respectively for DiTB and DiT-XL, with the rest split between head and tail. We use 4−20−4 for main experiments on DiT-XL.

Alternative variable-budget strategies. We evaluate other approaches for variable-budget inference in Table 4 (c). Following Anagnostidis et al. [1], Liu et al. [38], we train a DiT with two patchification layers (2×2 and 4×4) sampled uniformly during training, and set the batch size to 48 to match the baseline’s training FLOPs. In our experiments, this multi-patchification setup underperforms the standard DiT. We also replace tail-dropping strategy with random token dropping and observe a consistent performance drop.

Training Strategy. At each training step, we sample a compute budget by choosing the number of latent tokens per group, yielding variable FLOPs, which is lower on average than the baseline. To match baseline compute, we compare two strategies: (i) variable batch size scaled with lower budget, (ii) a constant batch size chosen to match baseline compute in expectation. As shown in Table 4 (d), both behave similarly, so we use the simpler constant batch size option.

#### 5. Discussion

ELIT introduces a minimal framework that improves compute allocation in DiTs via lightweight Read/Write layers, enabling flexible compute budgets. It consistently improves image and video generation quality across architectures (DiT, U-ViT, HDiT) and resolutions, while enabling efficient compute–quality trade-offs. However, large-scale, from-scratch training benefits remain unverified. Moreover, the proposed CCFG tends to saturate images faster than CFG. Future work can explore training and inference budget schedulers that allocate different budgets across sampling steps, following prior evidence that early sampling steps require less compute [1, 29].

- B. Baseline Details

DiT setup. We follow the standard DiT block design and incorporate recent improvements including QK normalization and rotary position embeddings (RoPE). Training hyperparameters match those of Peebles and Xie [45]: batch size = 256, 12 transformer blocks for DiT-B and 28 for DiTXL. We use patch size of 2×2 for all experiments. We train all baseline using rectified flow matching objective and use logit-normal distribution for sampling the timesteps.

U-ViT setup. U-ViT mirrors DiT but adds U-Net–style residual (skip) connections. To isolate architectural effects, we use the same transformer blocks and training hyperparameters as DiT, differing only in the inclusion of these residual connections.

HDiT setup. HDiT follows DiT but applies PixelShuffle/PixelUnshuffle to reduce the token count while increasing channel dimensionality. We adopt this token–channel trade-off on the same transformer blocks as baselines. We use a single downsampling/upsampling operation after blocks 6 and 22. We also exclude local attention and instead use full self-attention. We train with the same hyperparameters as the other baselines.

Qwen-Image setup. We add ELIT Read/Write layers at blocks 8 and 52 of the 60-layer Qwen-Image backbone. Training uses a weighted sum of RF and distillation losses. The distillation term is scaled by 20× to match the magnitude of the RF loss. We train for 60k steps at 512px with a global batch size of 1536, followed by 60k steps at 1024px with a global batch of 384. We sample timesteps from a logit-normal distribution and use time shifting of 2.22 during training and 2.0 during inference, following [56]. We do not apply any timestep-aware loss re-weighting. The training dataset is a combination of internal real images with synthetic samples generated by FLUX.1-Schnell and Stable Diffusion-XL (with 50/50 ratio). We found that the model converges quickly, but we observe a style bias toward the synthetic data (reduced detail and more saturation relative to original Qwen-Image). For sampling, we use the Euler ODE sampler with 40 steps and use CFG value of 6.0

TeaCache setup. TeaCache proposes two strategies for deciding when to reuse (cache) the previous step’s prediction: (1) using timestep-modulated tensor relative error between current and previous step to predict the accumulative error of caching the current step. (2) using timestep-embedding relative error, which measures the relative change of the timestep embedding itself across steps.

The original paper reports that strategy (1) generally works better. In text-to-image models (e.g., FLUX [34]), input tensors are modulated by the timestep embedding, providing access to the timestep-modulated input tensor. In our class-conditional image and video setting, those tensors are additionally modulated by the class signal, preventing access to timestep-modulated tensor. Empirically, on DiT for class-conditional ImageNet, we found that using classtimestep modulated input tensor following strategy (1) does not provide good estimate for the caching error and leads to degraded quality, underperforming the second strategy. Consequently, we adopt the timestep-embedding relative error (strategy 2) for all TeaCache experiments in this work.

#### C. Method Details

Adapting ELIT to baselines. Aside from adding the Read/Write operations, we leave each baseline’s architecture and training unchanged. Unless noted, we place the Read at block 4 and the Write at block 24 for XL-size models across all baseliness (DiT, U-ViT, HDiT), as motivated by our ablations in Table 4.

Multi-budget training setup. We use 16 spatial groups per image in all main experiments. On ImageNet-1K, each group contains 16 latent tokens at 256px and 64 at 512px. Unless otherwise noted, during training we set Jmax to the per-group maximum (64 at 512px; 16 at 256px) and Jmin to 1 for 256px and 4 for 512px, yielding 16 distinct inference budgets at 256px and 60 at 512px. At each training iteration, J˜is sampled once and broadcast to all GPUs, ensuring

synchronized compute with no added overhead. To account for the reduced compute, we increase the batch size from 256 (baselines) to 384 to match training FLOPs.

Kinetics-700 setup. We train at 256px on 29 frames sampled at 24 fps. The encoder produces 8 latent frames of shape 8×32×32. We use a patch size of 1×2×2, this yields 2,048 tokens. We use a group size of 2×4×4, giving 64 groups per video. Kinetics-700 is trained with a single compute budget without multi-budget training.

Inference setup. We use the Euler ODE sampler with 40 steps for all experiments. Image experiments are evaluated on the ImageNet-1K validation split, and video experiments on the Kinetics-700 validation split.

#### D. Compute-quality Tradeoff Efficiency

Increasing the training image resolution scales the required compute quadratically, making higher resolution training expensive. To control the compute while keeping model configuration the same, DiT proposed to increase the patch size to cut token count, while HDiT inserts a downsampling stage that reduces tokens but increases parameters count. We instead propose to cap the number of latent tokens per group during training, reducing training compute while keeping both patch size and model size constant.

To evaluate compute–quality trade-offs, we train low/high-compute variants for each baseline: DiT (larger patch size for the low variant), HDiT (model size matching other baselines), and ELIT-DiT (fewer latent tokens). Intuitively, given a similar reduction in compute between the two versions, the architecture with least performance degradation is more desirable.

To measure this, we define a degradation metric ρ = ((Metric Ratio)/FLOPs Ratio), where “Metric Ratio” represents metric degradation caused by the low-compute model and “FLOPs Ratio” represents the corresponding reduction in FLOPs. As shown in Table 5, not only our method outperforms baselines at similar training compute, but also shows consistently lower ρ indicating it can more efficiently make use of its comupte if constrained, a capa-

bility we attribute to the latent interface’s focus on the most important information in the input.

#### E. Ablations on Read/Write Strategies.

In Table 6, we compare alternative Read/Write designs and find that a single cross-attention Read layer outperforms both a Q-Former–style Read layer [35] and full selfattention. Additionally, stacking two cross-attention layers in the Read yields no measurable gain, suggesting one layer suffices. However, adding a second cross-attention layer in the Write or expanding the FFN hidden dimension by ×4 (as in the DiT block) offers improvements at the cost of additional FLOPs. To keep overhead at a minimum, we adopt a single Read/Write layer.

#### F. Compatibility with Distillation Methods.

We evaluate the compatibility of ELIT with the distillation technique such as grafting [7], which distills a base model into a smaller version of itself. We apply grafting on 100% ELIT MLPs with expansion ratio r = 3, obtaining 12.6% degradation in FID and 8.9% in IS, consistent with the original paper’s reported degradation of 17.2% FID and 9.4%

#### G. Budget scheduling Across Noise Levels.

We explore allocating different token budgets across noise levels. As a proof of concept, we train ELIT on ImageNet 512px (DiT-XL/2) with 50% of tokens for high-noise steps (t < 0.5) and 100% for the remaining steps (50% 100%). As shown in Table 7, despite lower per-iteration compute (154 vs. 188 TFLOPs), performance remains comparable, suggesting that high-noise steps may require fewer tokens. We leave a principled study of noise-level-aware budget scheduling for training and inference as future work.

model consistently outperforms independently trained models across all token budgets (100%, 50%, 25%) and all metrics. This demonstrates that multi-budget training acts as a regularizer, and that a single ELIT model natively supporting multiple budgets eliminates the need to train separate models for each budget.

#### H. Joint vs. Independent Budget Training.

We compare our joint multi-budget model against independently trained single-budget ELIT models on ImageNet 512px (DiT-XL/2). As shown in Table 8, the joint

#### I. Latent Token Importance Visualization.

We visualize the attention mask of the Read operation, averaged over noise levels, in Figure 12. Early latent tokens attend to broad image regions covering both background structure and the main object, whereas later tokens exhibit sparser attention patterns, often concentrating on finegrained texture details. This confirms the importance ordering learned through tail dropping and is consistent with the observation that increasing the token count for QwenImage primarily improves high-frequency texture details while preserving overall structure (Figure 1).

Figure 14. When tested with CFG 0.25, ELIT provides better quality-compute tradeoff than reducing the number of sampling steps.

#### J. Comparison with Token Merging Methods.

Token-merging methods [4, 8, 16, 42, 46, 57] can provide a knob to control inference budget. They are often training-free or require lightweight finetuning [8, 53] We compare ELIT against training-free token merging approaches (ToMe [4], SDTM [16]) on ImageNet 512px (DiTXL/2). As shown in Figure 13, both training-free methods trade compute for quality less favorably than ELIT. ELIT improves over the base DiT even when using only 25% of the tokens (FID10K=14.2), while training-free methods are upper bounded by DiT quality (FID10K=20.9).

#### K. Compute Analysis of ELIT

We analyze the theoretical computation requirement for ELIT-DiT in comparison with standard DiT design. Figure 10 (left) shows the relation between main architecture hyperparameters and FLOPs for the blocks employed by our architecture. When the number of core blocks is large with respect to spatial blocks, computation is focused on the latent core blocks and the Read and Write operations’ cost is minimal with respect to the model cost. Figure 10 (right) exemplifies the case of a DiT-XL/2 architecture for varying input sequence lengths. The latent interface is particularly effective at reducing FLOPs with large sequence lengths (e.g. training on higher resolutions) due to the dominant self attention cost that is quadratically reduced with J˜.

FLOPs vs latency in ELIT. Figure 11 reports FLOPs and wall-clock forward time for ELIT–DiT on ImageNet-1k at 512px as we vary the number of latent tokens per group.

Forward time drops monotonically with token count and closely follow the FLOPs reduction, showing that budget control yields real speedups. At higher budgets, the correlation weakens slightly due to fixed overheads (e.g., I/O and kernel launch), but the overall trend remains strongly aligned.

#### L. Additional Results

Compute-quality tradeoff. To verify the advantage of our method over simply reducing the number of sampling steps, we show in Figure 14 that our multi-budget model achieves a more favorable quality–compute tradeoff compared to varying the number of sampling steps.

Comparison to baselines. We show in Figure 18 additional qualitative results comparing our method to baselines on ImageNet-1K 512px. ELIT variants show less structural artifacts while allowing for per-step selection of inference budget and enabling autoguidance and cheap classifier-free guidance out of the box for cheaper and higher quality sampling.

Varying inference budget. In Figure 16, we evaluate the effects of varying the number of tokens in the latent interface for ELIT-DiT trained on ImageNet-1K 512px. As the model FLOPs decrease with the number of latent tokens, the model is able to preserve image structure while changing less noticeable details.

Guidance Scale

- Figure 15. HSL saturation comparison between CFG and CCFG, across guidance scales on ImageNet 512px (DiT-XL/2). CCFG exhibits slightly higher saturation than CFG, attributed to its autoguidance component.

uate the effects of classifier-free guidance (CFG), autoguidance [30], and the proposed cheap classifier-free guidance (CCFG) (see Figure 17). We notice that AG produces results with most variation, including wider ranges of camera poses, compositions with multiple subjects and objects occlusion. By comparing results across different weights, we notice that AG remains most closely aligned with low guidance weight results, avoiding the mode collapse effect visible for CFG and CCFG that pushes samples towards more object-centric representations for the given class. We attribute this observation to the lower Inception Scores obtained by AG in Figure 5. Both AG and CCFG produce improved results which are particularly noticeable in complex concepts such as humans. CCFG combines the objectcentric behavior of CFG, while reaping improved generation of complex objects from AG.

CCFG saturation analysis. We quantitatively analyze the saturation behavior of CCFG compared to CFG and AG. As shown in Figure 15, CCFG exhibits slightly higher HSL saturation across guidance scales, which we attribute to the stronger guiding effect contributed by its autoguidance component. The qualitative comparisons in Figure 17 shows that CCFG tends to saturate at larger guidance scales. Thus, we recommend using lower guidance scales with CCFG to mitigate this effect.

Additional Qwen-Image Results. We provide in Figure 19 additional qualitative comparison for ELIT-QwenImage against the original model. Thanks to CCFG, our model performs sampling with 69% of the FLOPs with respect to Qwen-Image and is able to produce a smooth tradeoff between sample quality and model FLOPs by varying the amount of tokens in the latent interface. In the cheapest shown configuration, ELIT-Qwen-Image uses only 35% of the FLOPs with respect to the original model. As the number of latent tokens is decreased, the model preserves

structural details, prioritizing changes in the least prominent image details.

Additional ImageNet-1k 512px Results. We provide in Figure 20, Figure 21 and Figure 22 additional qualitative comparison on ImageNet-1k 512px where we compare baseline DiT method with ELIT-DiT using CFG and CCFG. Class Ids and samples were randomly selected.

#### M. Failed Experiments

Spatial token masking for flexible inference computation. We explored ideas from masked diffusion transformers [17, 33, 65] as a way to obtain variable inference budget by dropping tokens in the spatial domains. We found token dropping in the spatial domain not to produce satisfactory results when applied at inference time and attribute its lower performance to the unrecoverable information loss in the spatial regions corresponding to dropped tokens.

Per group latent tokens count. We experiment with automatic per-group budget assignment, i.e. making J˜different for each group rather than uniform across groups, with the aim of assigning more tokens to groups with more complex content, further improving compute reallocation. To achieve this, we use the loss map to supervise an additional DiT block positioned at the beginning of the DiT which predicts importance score for every group according to the loss map. Given a desired total number of tokens, we automatically distribute latent tokens to different groups, assigning more tokens to groups with higher importance score. We find this variant to increase model and implementation complexity while matching the performance of ELIT. We hypothesize that our read operation is already tailored to read more from spatial tokens with higher loss as shown in Figure 2.
