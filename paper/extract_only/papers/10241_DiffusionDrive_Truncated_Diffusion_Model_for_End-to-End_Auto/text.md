### Abstract

Recently, the diffusion model has emerged as a powerful generative technique for robotic policy learning, capable of modeling multi-mode action distributions. Leveraging its capability for end-to-end autonomous driving is a promising direction. However, the numerous denoising steps in the robotic diffusion policy and the more dynamic, openworld nature of traffic scenes pose substantial challenges for generating diverse driving actions at a real-time speed. To address these challenges, we propose a novel truncated diffusion policy that incorporates prior multi-mode anchors and truncates the diffusion schedule, enabling the model to learn denoising from anchored Gaussian distribution to the multi-mode driving action distribution. Additionally, we design an efficient cascade diffusion decoder for enhanced interaction with conditional scene context. The proposed model, DiffusionDrive, demonstrates 10× reduction in denoising steps compared to vanilla diffusion policy, delivering superior diversity and quality in just 2 steps. On the planning-oriented NAVSIM dataset, with aligned ResNet34 backbone, DiffusionDrive achieves 88.1 PDMS without bells and whistles, setting a new record, while running at a real-time speed of 45 FPS on an NVIDIA 4090. Qualitative results on challenging scenarios further confirm that DiffusionDrive can robustly generate diverse plausible driving actions.

### 1. Introduction

End-to-end autonomous driving has gained significant attention in recent years due to advancements in perception models (detection [4, 17, 24, 42], tracking [54–56], online mapping [27, 28, 32], etc.), which directly learns the driving policy from the raw sensor inputs. This data-driven ap-

proach offers a scalable and robust alternative to traditional rule-based motion planning, which often struggles to generalize to complex real-world driving settings.

To effectively learn from data, mainstream end-to-end planners (e.g., Transfuser [7], UniAD [16], VAD [20]) typically regress a single-mode trajectory from an ego-query as shown in Fig. 1a. However, this paradigm does not account for the inherent uncertainty and multi-mode nature of driving behaviors. Recently, VADv2 [20] introduces a large fixed vocabulary of anchor trajectories (4096 anchors) to discretize the continuous action space and capture a broader range of driving behaviors, and then samples from these anchors based on predicted scores as shown in Fig. 1b. However, this large fixed-vocabulary paradigm is fundamentally constrained by the number and quality of anchor trajectories, often failing in out-of-vocabulary scenarios. Furthermore, managing a large number of anchors presents significant computational challenges for real-time applications. Rather than discretizing the action space, diffusion model [6] has proven to be a powerful genera-

tive decision-making policy in the robotics domain, which can directly sample multi-mode physically plausible actions from a Gaussian distribution via iterative denoising process.

This inspires us to replicate the success of the diffusion model in the robotics domain to end-to-end autonomous driving. We apply the vanilla robotic diffusion policy to the well-known single-mode-regression method, Transfuser [7], by proposing a variant, TransfuserDP, which replaces the deterministic MLP regression head with a conditional diffusion model [34]. Though TransfuserDP improves planning performance, two major issues arise: 1) The numerous 20 denoising steps in the vanilla DDIM diffusion policy introduce heavy computational consumption during inference as shown in Tab. 2, hindering the real-time application for autonomous driving. 2) The trajectories sampled from different Gaussian noises severely overlap with each other, as illustrated in Fig. 2. This underscores the non-trivial challenge of taming the diffusion models for the dynamic and open-world traffic scenes.

Unlike the vanilla diffusion policy, which samples actions from a random Gaussian noise conditioned on scene context, human drivers adhere to established driving patterns that they dynamically adjust in response to real-time traffic conditions. This insight motivates us to embed these prior driving patterns into the diffusion policy by partitioning the Gaussian distribution into multiple sub-Gaussian distributions centered around prior anchors, referred to as anchored Gaussian distribution. It is implemented by truncating the diffusion schedule to introduce a small portion of Gaussian noise around the prior anchors as shown in Fig. 3. Thanks to the multi-mode distributional expressivity of the diffusion model, the proposed truncated diffusion policy effectively covers the potential action space without requiring a large set of fixed anchors, as VADv2 does. With more reasonable initial noise samples from the anchored Gaussian distribution, we can truncate the denoising process, reducing the required steps from 20 to just 2—a substantial speedup that satisfies the real-time requirements of autonomous driving.

To enhance the interaction with conditional scene context, we propose an efficient transformer-based diffusion decoder that interacts not only with structured queries from the perception module but also with Bird’s Eye View (BEV) and perspective view (PV) features through a sparse deformable attention mechanism [62]. Additionally, we introduce a cascade mechanism to iteratively refine the trajectory reconstruction within the diffusion decoder at each denoising step.

With these innovations, we present DiffusionDrive, a diffusion model for real-time end-to-end autonomous driving. We benchmark our method on the planningoriented NAVSIM dataset [10] using non-reactive simulation and closed-loop evaluations. Without bells and whis-

tles, DiffusionDrive achieves 88.1 PDMS on NAVSIM navtest split with the aligned ResNet-34 backbone, significantly outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods. Even compared to the NAVSIM challenge-winning solution Hydra-MDP-V8192-W-EP [25], which follows VADv2 with 8192 anchor trajectories and further incorporates postprocessing and additional supervision, DiffusionDrive still outperforms it by 1.6 PDMS through directly learning from human demonstrations and inferring without postprocessing, while running at real-time speed of 45 FPS on an NVIDIA 4090. We further validate the superiority of DiffusionDrive on popular nuScenes dataset [2] with openloop evaluations, DiffusionDrive runs 1.8× faster than VAD and outperforms it [20] by 20.8% lower L2 error and 63.6% lower collision rate with the same ResNet-50 backbone, demonstrating state-of-the-art planning performance.

Our contributions can be summarized as follows:

- • We firstly introduce the diffusion model to the field of end-to-end autonomous driving and propose a novel truncated diffusion policy to address the issues of mode collapse and heavy computational overhead found in direct adaptation of vanilla diffusion policy to the traffic scene.
- • We design an efficient transformer-based diffusion decoder that interacts with the conditional information in a cascaded manner for better trajectory reconstruction.
- • Without bells and whistles, DiffusionDrive significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods, achieving a record-breaking 88.1 PDMS on the NAVSIM navtest split with the same backbone, while maintaining real-time performance at 45 FPS on an NVIDIA 4090.
- • We qualitatively demonstrate that DiffusionDrive can generate more diverse and plausible trajectories, exhibiting high-quality multi-mode driving actions in various challenging scenarios.

VAD [20] further explores the use of compact vectorized scene representations to improve efficiency. Subsequently, a series of works [5, 7, 12, 23, 26, 43, 45, 58] have adopted the single-trajectory planning paradigm to enhance planning performance further. More recently, VADv2 [3] shifts the paradigm towards multi-mode planning by scoring and sampling from a large fixed vocabulary of anchor trajectories. HydraMDP [25] improves the scoring mechanism of VADv2 by introducing extra supervision from a rule-based scorer. SparseDrive [39] explores an alternative BEV-free solution. Unlike existing multi-mode planning approaches, we propose a novel paradigm that leverages powerful generative

tion [1, 53], mobile manipulation [47], autonomous navigation [37, 51], quadruped locomotion [38], and dexterous manipulation [46]. However, directly applying vanilla diffusion policy to end-to-end autonomous driving poses unique challenges, as it requires real-time efficiency and the generation of plausible multi-mode trajectories in dynamic and open-world traffic scenes. In this work, we propose a novel truncated diffusion policy to address these challenges, introducing concepts that have not yet been explored in the robotics field.

#### 3.1. Preliminary

Task formulation. End-to-end autonomous driving takes raw sensor data as input and predicts the future trajectory of the ego-vehicle. The trajectory is represented as a sequence

of waypoints τ = {(xt,yt)}Tt=1f , where Tf denotes the planning horizon, and (xt,yt) is the location of each waypoint at time t in the current ego-vehicle coordinate system.

Diffusion model for image generation. Diffusion models have been extensively adopted for image generation tasks [33, 36, 49, 50, 61]. DDIM [35] enhances DDPM [14] by enabling efficient sampling with significantly fewer steps based on non-Markovian diffusion processes. Flow matching [30, 31] further optimizes the generative process by directly modeling continuous probability flows. TDPM [57] proposes truncated denoising, which initiates the generation process from an implicit intermediate distribution to accelerate sampling. In contrast to these approaches, our method introduces an explicit driving prior within the diffusion policy, effectively guiding the diffusion process toward more accurate and efficient generation tailored specifically

Conditional diffusion model. The conditional diffusion model poses a forward diffusion process as gradually adding noise to the data sample, which can be defined as:

√

α¯iτ0, 1 − α¯i I , (1)

where τ0 is the clean data sample, and τi is the data sample with noise at time i (Note: we use superscript i to denote diffusion timestep). The constant α¯i = is=1 αs =

i s=1(1−βs) and βs is the noise schedule. We train the reverse process model fθ(τi,z,i) to predict τ0 from τi with the guidance of conditional information z, where θ is the

Heavy denoising overhead. The DDIM [35] diffusion policy requires 20 denoising steps to transform random noise into a feasible trajectory, which introduces significant computational overhead, reducing the FPS from 60 to 7, as shown in Tab. 2, and making it impractical for real-time online driving applications.

#### 3.3. Truncated Diffusion

i=1

Human driving follows fixed patterns, unlike the random noise denoising in vanilla diffusion policy. Motivated by this, we propose a truncated diffusion policy that begins the denoising process from an anchored Gaussian distribution instead of a standard Gaussian distribution. To enable the model to learn to denoise from the anchored Gaussian distribution to the desired driving policy, we further truncate the diffusion schedule during training, adding only a small amount of Gaussian noise to the anchors.

#### 3.2. Investigation

Turn Transfuser [7] into conditional diffusion model. We begin from the representative deterministic end-to-end planner Transfuser [7] and turn it into a generative model TransfuserDP by simply replacing the regression MLP layers with the conditional diffusion model UNet following vanilla diffusion policy [6]. During the evaluation, we sample a random noise and progressively refine it with 20 steps. Tab. 2 shows that TransfuserDP achieves better planning quality than deterministic Transfuser.

Training. We first construct the diffusion process by adding Gaussian noise to anchors {ak}N

Mode collapse. To further investigate the multi-mode property of the vanilla diffusion policy in driving, we sampled 20 random noises from Gaussian distribution and denoised them using 20 steps. As shown in Fig. 2, the different random noises converge to similar trajectories after the denoising process. To quantitatively analyze the phenomenon of mode collapse, we define a mode diversity score D based on the mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) between each denoised trajectory and the union of all denoised trajectories:

k=1 from the anchored Gaussian distribution, we begin by applying deformable spatial cross-attention [29, 42, 62] to interact with Bird’s Eye View (BEV) or Perspective View (PV) features based on the trajectory coordinates. Subsequently, cross-attention is performed between the trajectory features and the agent/map queries derived from the perception module, followed by a feed-forward network (FFN). To encode the diffusion timestep information, we utilize a Timestep Modulation layer, which is followed by a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) that predicts the confidence score and the offset relative to the initial noisy trajectory coordinates. The output from this diffusion decoder layer serves as the input for the subsequent cascade diffusion decoder layer. DiffusionDrive further reuses the cascade diffusion decoder to iteratively denoise the trajectory during inference, with parameters shared across the different denoising timesteps. The final trajectory with the highest confidence score is selected as the output.

The training and inference recipe directly follows Transfuser: We use three cropped and downscaled forward-facing camera images, concatenated as a 1024×256 image, and a rasterized BEV LiDAR as input; DiffusionDrive is trained on navtrain split from scratch for 100 epochs with AdamW optimizer on 8 NVIDIA 4090 GPUs with total batch size of 512, setting the learning rate to 6 × 10−4. No test-time augmentation is applied and the final output for evaluation on navtest split is 8-waypoint trajectory over 4 seconds.

#### 4.1. Dataset

NAVSIM. The NAVSIM dataset [10] is a real-world planning-oriented dataset builds upon OpenScene [9], a compact redistribution of nuPlan [22], the largest publicly available annotated driving dataset. NAVSIM leverages eight cameras to achieve a full 360◦ FOV, along with a merged LiDAR point cloud derived from five sensors. Annotations are provided at a frequency of 2Hz and include both HD maps and object bounding boxes. The dataset is designed to emphasize challenging driving scenarios involving dynamic changes in driving intentions, while deliberately excluding trivial situations such as stationary scenes or constant-speed driving.

#### 4.3. Quantitative Comparison

NAVSIM benchmarks planning performance using nonreactive simulations and closed-loop metrics for comprehensive evaluation. In this paper, we employ the proposed PDM score (PDMS) [10], which is a weighted combination of several sub-scores: no at-fault collisions (NC), drivable area compliance (DAC), time-to-collision (TTC), comfort (Comf.), and ego progress (EP).

Tab. 1 compares DiffusionDrive with state-of-the-art methods on NAVSIM navtest split. With the same ResNet34 backbone, DiffusionDrive achieves 88.1 PDMS score, demonstrating significant superior performance over the previous learning-based methods. Compared to VADv2, DiffusionDrive surpasses it by 7.2 PDMS while reducing the number of anchors from 8192 to 20, representing a 400× reduction. DiffusionDrive also outperforms HydraMDP, which follows VADv2’s sampling-from-vocabulary paradigm, with a 5.1 PDMS improvement. Even compared to the Hydra-MDP-V8192-W-EP, which is a variant of Hydra-MDP [25] by further training to fit the EP evaluation metric with additional supervision and using weighted confidence post-processing, DiffusionDrive still outperforms it by 3.5 EP and 1.6 overall PDMS, relying solely on a straightforward learning-from-human approach without any post-processing. Compared to the Transfuser baseline, where we only differ in the planning module, DiffusionDrive delivers a notable 4.1 PDMS improvement, outperforming it across all sub-scores.

#### 4.2. Implementation Detail

We adopt the same perception modules and ResNet-34 backbone [13] as Transfuser for fair comparison. In the diffusion decoder layer, we employ spatial cross-attention to only interact with BEV features following Transfuser’s BEV-based setting. We only perform agent cross-attention, since the perception module of Transfuser does not include vectorized map construction. We stack 2 cascade diffusion decoder layers and apply truncated diffusion policy with 20 clustered anchors. The training diffusion schedule is truncated by 50/1000 to diffuse the anchors, while during inference, we use only 2 denoising steps and select the top-

#### 4.4. Roadmap

DiffusionDrive can generate varied trajectories by simply sampling a variable number of noises from anchored Gaussian distribution. Tab. 6 shows that 10 sampled noises can already achieve a decent planning quality. By sampling more noises, DiffusionDrive can cover potential planning action space and lead to improved planning quality.

In Tab. 2, converting Transfuser into the generative TransfuserDP using vanilla diffusion policy improves the PDMS score by 0.6 and the mode diversity score D by 11%. However, it also significantly increases the overhead of the planning module, requiring 20× more denoising steps and 32× the step time, resulting in a total 650× increase in runtime overhead. With the proposed truncated diffusion policy, TransfuserTD reduces the number of denoising steps from 20 to 2 while improving PDMS by 1.1 and mode diversity by 59%. By further incorporating the proposed diffusion decoder, the final model, DiffusionDrive, reaches 88.1 PDMS and 74% mode diversity score D. Compared to the TransfuserDP, DiffusionDrive shows improvements in 3.5 PDMS and 64% mode diversity, and a 10× reduction in denoising steps, resulting in a 6× speedup in FPS. This enables real-time, high-quality, multi-mode planning.

#### 4.6. Qualitative Comparison

Since the PDMS planning metric calculates based on the top-1 scoring trajectory and our proposed D score evaluates mode diversity, these metrics alone cannot fully capture the quality of diverse trajectories. To further validate the quality of multi-mode trajectories, we visualize the planning results of Transfuser, TransfuserDP and DiffusionDrive on challenging scenarios of NAVSIM navtest split in Fig. 2. The results indicate that the multi-mode trajectories generated by DiffusionDrive are not only diverse but also of high quality. In Fig. 2a, the top-1 scoring trajectory generated by DiffusionDrive closely resembles the ground-truth trajectory, while the highlighted top-10 scoring trajectory surprisingly tries to perform high-quality lane changing. In Fig. 2b, the highlighted top-10 scoring trajectory also performs a lane change, and a neighboring low-scoring trajectory further interacts with surrounding agents to effectively avoid collisions.

#### 4.5. Ablation Study

Effect of designs in diffusion decoder. Tab. 3 shows the effectiveness of our design choices in the diffusion decoder. ID-1 is the TransfuserTD in the Tab. 2. By comapring ID-6 and ID-1, we can see that the proposed diffusion decoder reduce the 39% parameters and significantly improves the planning quality by 2.4 PDMS. ID-2 shows severe performance degeneration due to the lack of rich and hierarchical interaction with the environment. By comparing ID-2 and ID-3, we show that spatial cross-attention is vital for accurate planning. ID-5 shows that the proposed cascade mechanism is effective and can further improve the performance. Denoising step number. Tab. 4 shows that due to a reasonable start point, DiffusionDrive achieves good planning quality even with only 1 step, and further denoising steps offer quality improvement and inference flexibility for complex environments.

#### 4.7. Quantitative Comparison on nuScenes dataset

The nuScenes dataset is previously popular benchmark for end-to-end planning. Since the major scenarios of nuScenes are simple and trivial situations, we only perform comparison in Tab. 7. We implement DiffusionDrive on top of SparseDrive [39] following its training and inference recipe using open-loop metrics proposed in ST-P3 [15]. We stack 2 cascade diffusion decoder layers and apply the truncated diffusion policy with 18 clustered anchors.

Cascade stages. Tab. 5 ablates the impact of cascade stage number. Increasing the stage number can improve the planning quality but saturate at the 4 stages and cost more parameters and inference time at each step.

As shown in Tab. 7, DiffusionDrive reduces the average L2 error of SparseDrive by 0.04m, achieving the lowest L2 error and average collision rate. While DiffusionDrive is also efficient and runs 1.8× faster than VAD with 20.8% lower L2 error and 63.6% lower collision rate.

Number of sampled noises Ninfer. As stated in Sec. 3.3,

### 5. Conclusion

In this work, we propose a novel generative driving decision-making model, DiffusionDrive, for end-to-end autonomous driving by incorporating the proposed truncated diffusion policy and efficient cascade diffusion decoder. DiffusionDrive can denoise a variable number of samples from an anchored Gaussian distribution to generate diverse planning trajectories at real-time speeds. Comprehensive experiments and qualitative comparisons validate the superiority of DiffusionDrive in planning quality, running efficiency, and mode diversity.

We provide additional implementation details for our method on the NAVSIM [10] and nuScenes [2] datasets.

Table 9. Generalization of anchor source. We test DiffusionDrive on Carla Longest6 benchmark with clustered anchors from NAVSIM dataset. † denotes that the result is taken from Transfuser paper [7].

NAVSIM Dataset. We initialize the ResNet-34 [13] backbone with ImageNet pre-trained weights, and the LiDAR range is 32m to the front, back, left, and right following Transfuser baseline [10]. We also perform auxiliary perception tasks following Transfuser baseline [10], which include 3D object detection, 2D BEV semantic segmentation. The object queries and BEV features are taken as input of the proposed diffusion decoder.

Generalization of anchor source. To further investigate the generalization of anchor source, we train DiffusionDrive on CARLA [11] with NAVSIM-clustered anchored Gaussian distribution (Row-2 in Tab. 9). Since the CARLA dataset is totally different from NAVSIM, the superior results validate the generalization capability of our anchored Gaussian distribution, which is designed to cover potential multi-mode driving action space instead of train/val information leakage.

nuScenes Dataset. We follow the SparseDrive baseline [39] to perform two-stage training. The model is directly initialized with the stage-1 pre-trained weight, which is trained solely on perception tasks (3D object detection/tracking, vectorized HD map construction, and motion prediction) and provided by the official open-source implementation. We train the stage-2 model on the nuScenes dataset for 10 epochs, replacing the planning module of SparseDrive with our proposed diffusion decoder and truncated diffusion mechanism. Object queries, map queries, and PV features are taken as inputs to the diffusion decoder.

### C. Further Qualitative Comparison

In this section, we provide additional qualitative comparisons on challenging scenarios from the planning-oriented NAVSIM dataset navtest split [10].

Going straight. Fig. 5a and Fig. 5b show that the top1 scoring trajectories of DiffusionDrive are similar to the ground truth trajectories, while the highlighted top-10 scoring trajectories can perform robust lane changes. Notably, Fig. 5c demonstrates that the diverse and highlighted top-10 trajectories can further recognize the traffic light, enabling reasonable lane changes and stopping at the stop line.

Turning left. Fig. 6 shows that the denoised diverse trajectories are dynamically adjusted based on the traffic conditions. The highlighted top-10 scoring trajectories are robust and reasonable, effectively performing lane changes.

- Table 8. Comparison on driving priors. “Anchored Dist.” denotes anchored Gaussian distribution. “Extra. Traj.” denotes extrapolated trajectory based on current status. Row-1 marked in blue denotes the DiffusioDrive baseline of the main paper.

Comparison on driving priors. In Tab. 8, we validate the superiority of prior anchors over the prior extrapolated trajectory based on the current status. Row-1 is DiffusionDrive baseline. Row-2 uses the DiffusionDrive baseline model to infer from an extrapolated trajectory instead of sampled Ninfer trajectories. Row-3 represents DiffusionDrive trained with a single anchor, i.e., the extrapolated trajectory, and infers by sampling around it. The results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed anchored Gaussian distribution over extrapolated prior, which fails to cover the potential action space and can not effectively handle challenging scenarios (e.g., obstacle avoidance and turning) in real-world application (consistent with comparisons to egostatus-based planners in Tab. 1 of NAVSIM paper [10]).

Turning right. Fig. 7a and Fig. 7b show that the top-1 scoring trajectories of DiffusionDrive are going to perform car-following like the ground truth trajectories, while the highlighted top-10 scoring trajectories tend to overtake the leading vehicle. These results validate that DiffusionDrive can robustly generate diverse and plausible driving actions.
