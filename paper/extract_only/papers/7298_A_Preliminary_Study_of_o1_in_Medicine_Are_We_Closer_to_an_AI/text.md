ABSTRACT

Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable capabilities across various domains and tasks, pushing the boundaries of our knowledge in learning and cognition. The latest model, OpenAI’s o1, stands out as the first LLM with an internalized chain-of-thought technique using reinforcement learning strategies. While it has demonstrated surprisingly strong capabilities on various general language tasks, its performance in specialized fields such as medicine remains unknown. To this end, this report provides a preliminary exploration of o1 on different medical scenarios, comprehensively examining 3 key aspects: understanding, reasoning, and multilinguality. Specifically, our evaluation encompasses 6 tasks using data from 37 medical datasets, including two newly constructed and more challenging question-answering (QA) tasks based on professional medical quizzes from the New England Journal of Medicine and The Lancet. These datasets offer greater clinical relevance compared to standard medical QA benchmarks such as MedQA, translating more effectively into real-world clinical utility. Our analysis of o1 suggests that the enhanced reasoning ability of LLMs may (significantly) benefit their capability to understand various medical instructions and reason through complex clinical scenarios. Notably, o1 surpasses the previous GPT-4 in accuracy by an

average of 6.2% and 6.6% across 19 datasets and two newly created complex QA scenarios. But meanwhile, we also identify several weaknesses in both the model capability and the existing evaluation protocols, including hallucination, inconsistent multilingual ability, and discrepant metrics for evaluation. We release our raw data and model outputs at https://ucsc-vlaa.github.io/o1_medicine/ for future research.

- 1 INTRODUCTION

Intelligence, a complex and elusive concept, has puzzled psychologists, philosophers, and computer scientists for years (Bubeck et al., 2023). While there is no single agreed-upon definition of intelligence, it is widely accepted that it spans a broad range of cognitive skills, rather than being confined to a specific task (McCarthy et al., 1955). Creating artificial systems with such general intelligence has been a long-standing and ambitious goal of AI research. The most exciting progresses in AI are achieved by language models in these years, from the initial start of ChatGPT to its evolution and other open-source projects (Touvron et al., 2023a;b; Jiang et al., 2023; Bai et al., 2023; Peng et al., 2024).

Early LLM pioneers set out goals to understand and interact with human by exploring generalizable reasoning mechanisms and building knowledge bases with vast amounts of commonsense information. With parameters and data volume in place, the question of how to effectively prompt the model from the user end and train it from the developer end has become a trending topic of exploration (Wei et al.,

- 2022; Ouyang et al., 2022). On the user side, varying prompting techniques can significantly impact model performance. Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting (Wei et al., 2022; Dong et al., 2022; Saunders et al., 2022), one of the most popular strategies, leverages the model’s internal reasoning patterns to enhance its ability to solve complex tasks. OpenAI capitalized on this by embedding the CoT process into model training, integrating reinforcement learning, and finally introduced the o1 model (OpenAI, 2024). While the o1 model demonstrates strong performance in general domains, its effectiveness in specialized fields like medicine—where domain-specific training may be lacking—remains uncertain. Moreover, current benchmarks for LLMs in the medical domain often evaluate models only on a limited set of factors, often focusing on isolated aspects such as knowledge and reasoning (Nori et al.,
- 2023b; Li´evin et al., 2024), safety (Han et al., 2024), or multilinguality (Wang et al., 2024). These factors make a comprehensive assessment of LLMs’ capabilities—especially for advanced models like o1—in medical challenging tasks (Figure 1).

This paper aims to provide an initiative to close this gap, focusing on o1. We identify three fundamental aspects of LLMs in medicine: understanding, reasoning, and multilinguality. To evaluate these capabilities, we assembled 35 existing medical datasets and developed two novel, challenging QA datasets that include instructions and expected outputs, ensuring comprehensive assessment. With evaluation on this extensive suite, our key findings include:

- • o1 demonstrates improved transfer of clinical understanding and reasoning abilities, validating its competence in real-world diagnostic scenarios compared with both close- and open-source models as presented in Figure 1 and Figure 2;
- • No single model excels across all tasks on our medical leaderboard, though o1 comes close to dominating most evaluations;
- • o1 still suffers from the long-standing issue of hallucination and complex multilingual medical cases;
- • Inconsistencies in metrics for medical NLP can significantly affect models’ standings, which calls for a re-evaluation of reliable metrics for future LLMs;
- • CoT prompting can further enhance o1 in medicine, despite its training having already integrated CoT data.

In addition to these findings, we also elevate the discussion section as an initial attempt to address the issues identified during our benchmarking in Section 5. Particularly, we highlight the potential negative effects of o1, emphasize the urgent need for consistent and unified evaluation metrics for future LLMs, and advocate for improved instruction templates that can be applied to models with embedded prompting strategies.

- 2 RELATED WORKS

Large Language Models with Enhanced Reasoning Ability. Large Language models (LLMs) based on next token prediction pre-training (Touvron et al., 2023a;b; Achiam et al., 2023) have demonstrated promising capabilities on various language undersanding tasks. Instruction fine-tuning further improved the abilites of these LLMs for following user instructions. However, recent studies suggest that LLMs struggle with complex tasks involving logical reasoning. To address this issue, some researches propose to instruct LLMs to mimic human thinking processes by producing a chainof-thought (CoT) (Feng et al., 2024; Wei et al., 2022) before generating a final answer. Reinforcement learning from human feedback (Ouyang et al., 2022) has also been employed to enhance reasoning while make sure the models align with human values (Tu et al., 2023b;a). Recently, OpenAI introduced o1, which was trained on a vast amount of CoT data, further enhancing the capability of LLMs in solving scientific problems. In this paper, we aim to investigate whether enhanced abilities of o1 effectively transfer to the clinical medical domain.

Medical Large Language Models. Benefiting from the generalization capabilities of LLMs, generalpurpose models such as GPT-4 have demonstrated impressive performance on challenging medical problems (Nori et al., 2023a; Wu et al., 2024b). Some researchers have attempted to further equip LLMs with biomedical knowledge by fine-tuning them using domain-specific corpora (Chen et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2024a; Li et al., 2023). However, for clinical applications, LLMs are not only required to understand medical domain-specific knowledge but also to produce reliable responses by performing logical reasoning. In this paper, we aim to explore the potential of o1 as a clinical viable model. Our experimental findings reveal that with enhanced understanding, reasoning, and multilinguality medical capabilities, o1 makes a step closer to reliable clinical AI-system.

- 3.1 OVERALL TAXONOMY OF EVALUATIONS

First, we present the taxonomy of our evaluation, along with an overview of the evaluation pipeline as shown in Figure 3. Firstly, we specify three aspects of the model capabilities, namely understanding, reasoning, and multilinguality, that correspond to the real-world needs of clinical physicians. To ensure a comprehensive evaluation, we collect a diverse range of medical tasks and datasets that fall under these three aspects. Moreover, we explore three prompting strategies in our pipeline, including (1) direct prompting, which instructs LLMs to solve specific problems directly, (2) chain-ofthought, which requires models to think step-by-step before generating the final answer, (3) few-shot

- 3.2 ASPECTS AND TASKS

In Table 1, our evaluation efforts are structured into three main parts: aspect, task, and dataset. Specifically, a dataset refers to the data itself along with the metrics used in the current context. We utilize 35 existing datasets and create 2 additional challenging datasets for evaluation. A task is a collection of multiple datasets that share a common goal or evaluate similar capabilities within the model. We categorize all 37 datasets into 6 tasks for clearer evaluation and analysis. An aspect describes a specific capability or property to understand how well the model performs in a particular area. In our evaluation pipeline, we focus on three key aspects.

Formally, we illustrate these three evaluation aspects with their corresponding tasks as follows:

- • Understanding refers to the model’s ability to utilize its internal medical knowledge to comprehend medical concepts. For example, in concept recognition task, the model is required to extract or elaborate medical concepts from article (Savery et al., 2020; Pafilis et al., 2013; Nye et al., 2018) or diagnosis report (Zhao et al., 2023). And in text summarization, the model need to understand concepts in complex texts to generate a concise summary (Lee et al., 2021; Wallace et al., 2021; Johnson et al., 2019; 2023).
- • Reasoning is the ability to conduct multiple steps of logical thinking to arrive at the conclusion. In question answering tasks, the model is prompted to select correct option from multi-choices based on reasoning derived from the medical information provided in the question. In addition to common question-answering datasets (Jin et al., 2019; Pal et al., 2022; Jin et al., 2021), we collect real-world clinical questions from The Lancet, the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM), and Medbullets (Chen et al., 2024) to better assess the clinical utility of LLMs. In the clinical suggestion task, the model is required to provide treatment suggestions (Dubey et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023) or diagnostic decisions (Xie et al., 2022; Fansi Tchango et al., 2022) based on patients’ information. In the AI Hospital (Fan et al., 2024) and AgentClinic (Schmidgall et al., 2024) datasets, we task the model with serving as a medical agent. Furthermore, in the MedCalc-Bench (Khandekar et al., 2024) dataset, the model is required to perform mathematical reasoning and calculate answers.
- • Multilinguality is the ability to complete a task when the languages of input instruction and/or output answers are changed to different languages. For example, XMedBench (Wang et al., 2024) dataset requires LLMs to answer medical questions in six languages, including Chinese, Arabic, Hindi, Spanish, Chinese and English. In AI Hospital dataset (Fan et al., 2024), the model is required to serve as an agent using Chinese.

- 3.3 METRICS In this section, we elaborate on metrics employed in our evaluation pipeline.

- • Accuracy is used to directly measure the percentage of models’ generated answer which exactly match with the ground-truth. We use accuracy for multi-choice question datasets, MedCalcBench (Khandekar et al., 2024) dataset, and portions of clinical suggestion and concept recognition datasets where the ground-truth answer is a single word or phrase.
- • F1-score (Pedregosa et al., 2011) is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. It is employed in datasets where the model is required to select multiple correct answers.
- • BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) and ROUGE (Lin & Hovy, 2002) are NLP metrics measuring the similarity between the generated respond and the ground-truth. Specifically, we utilize BLEU-1 and ROUGE-1 for all free-form generation tasks in our evaluation.
- • AlignScore (Zha et al., 2023) is a metric to measure the factual consistency of generated text. In this paper, we use AlignScore for all free-form generation tasks to evaluate the extent of model’s hallucination.
- • Mauve (Pillutla et al., 2021) is a measure of gap between distribution of generated and humanwritten text. It is employed for all free-form generation tasks.

All metrics range from 0 to 100, and a higher number indicates better quality output from the model.

- 4 EXPERIMENTS

- 4.1 EXPERIMENT DETAILS

Prompting strategies. For most datasets, we employ the same prompting strategy as described in previous literature (Wu et al., 2024b; Nori et al., 2023b;a): For knowledge QA tasks, agent tasks, medical calculation tasks, and multilingual-related tasks, we use the direct prompting evaluation method, which is consistent with the settings of these benchmarks. For other tasks derived from MedS-Bench (Wu et al., 2024b), we follow their benchmark settings, leveraging a few-shot (3shot) prompt strategy with its template shown in Section A.1. As officially suggested by OpenAI, common prompting techniques such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) (Wei et al., 2022) and in-context examples may not boost o1’s performance as it has implicit CoT built in. To further validate this claim, we also investigate the effect of several advanced promptings in our evaluation (e.g., CoT, Self-Consistency (Wang et al., 2022), and Reflex (Shinn et al., 2024)), the detailed input instruction formats are in Section A.1

Models for evaluation. We choose the following models to evaluate: GPT-3.5 (gpt-3.5-turbo0125)3, an advanced language model by OpenAI known for its enhanced contextual understanding; GPT-4 (gpt-4-0125-preview) (Achiam et al., 2023), the successor to GPT-3.5 with significant improvements in reasoning and language comprehension; o1 (o1-preview-2024-09-12) (OpenAI, 2024), the lastest LLM model that is capable of performing highly complex reasoning by employing chain-of-thought reasoning. Apart from these close-source models, we have also incorporated two open-source ones in our experiments: MEDITRON-70B (Chen et al., 2023), an LLM trained with medical-centric data and Llama3-8B (Meta, 2024), the latest and strongest open LLM right now.

- 4.2 MAIN RESULT: Yes! WE ARE ONE STEP CLOSER TO AN AI DOCTOR

[Figure 20]

Enhanced ability of o1 transfers to its clinical understanding. Given the established results from o1, which underscore its remarkable effectiveness in knowledge and reasoning abilities such as mathematical problem-solving and code generation (OpenAI, 2024), we observe that this superior capability can also be transferred to the specific clinical knowledge understanding. Results presented in Table 2 demonstrate that o1 outperforms other models on the understanding aspect in most clinical tasks. We also present these statistics in Figure 1, where we observe that o1 has a larger cover radius across various medical datasets. For instance, on 5 concept recognition datasets that use F1 as the metric, o1 outperforms both GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 by an average of 7.6% and 26.6%, respectively (i.e., 72.6% vs. 65.0% vs. 46.0%), with a notable 24.5% average improvement on the widely used BC4Chem dataset.

Additionally, on the summarization task in Table 3, o1 achieves a 2.4% and 3.7% increase in ROUGE-1 score over GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 (i.e., 31.4% vs. 29.0% vs. 27.7%), demonstrating its enhanced capacity for real-world clinical understanding. This improved performance confirms that advancements in general NLP capabilities for LLMs can effectively translate to enhanced model understanding in the medical domain.

The o1 model demonstrates strong reasoning in clinical diagnosis scenarios. On the reasoning aspect, o1 takes a significant step forward in demonstrating its advantages in real-world diagnostic situations. In our newly constructed challenging QA tasks, NEJMQA and LacentQA, o1 showcases an average accuracy improvement of 8.9% and 27.1% over the performance of GPT-4 (79.6%) and GPT-3.5 (61.5%) on the respective datasets (Table 2). Another noteworthy improvement in o1 is its capacity for mathematical reasoning, elevating the baseline of MedCalc-Bench to 34.9%, which surpasses GPT-4 by a significant 9.4%. In more complex reasoning scenarios that involve multi-turn conversations and environmental simulations, o1 outperforms both GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 on the AgentClinic benchmark, achieving accuracy gains of at least 15.5% and 10% with scores of 45.5% and 20.0% on its MedQA and NEJM subsets, respectively. These observations serve as compelling evidence of o1’s competence in complex real-world diagnosis and clinical utility scenarios.

In addition to delivering higher accuracy, o1 provides more concise and straightforward answers. In the example illustrated in Figure 4, o1 generates shorter interpretations while offering the correct answer. In contrast, GPT-4 tends to generate hallucinated explanations alongside incorrect answers. We believe o1’s improvement in both knowledge and reasoning is primarily attributed to the enhanced data and infrastructure employed during the training process (e.g., CoT data and the reinforcement learning technique).

These results together provide a positive answer to the question we raised in this paper: Yes! We are getting closer to an automatic AI doctor with the latest o1 model.

Question: A 2-month-old infant with a 1-month history of a generalised persistent blistering rash (figure) and a 4-day history of vomiting and poor oral intake attended our hospital with her mother. What is the most likely cause of the rash that appears at 1 month of age and resolves naturally by 2 months? Options: A) Congenital candidiasis B) Congenital CMV infection C) Congenital syphilis D) Herpes simplex infection

[Figure 22]

[Figure 23]

Answer: C) Congenital syphilis Reasoning:

The infant presented with a generalized persistent blistering rash that began at 1 month of age and resolved by 2 months. Among the options, congenital syphilis is known to present with bullous skin lesions (pemphigus syphiliticus) in infants, typically appearing around this age. These lesions can be generalized and involve the palms and soles. The vomiting and poor oral intake could be associated

[Figure 24]

systemic symptoms of congenital syphilis. The other options are less likely: congenital candidiasis usually presents earlier and isn't characterized by a generalized blistering rash; congenital CMV typically presents at birth with petechial rashes; neonatal herpes simplex infection usually presents within the first few weeks of life.

[Figure 25]

[Figure 26]

Answer: A) Congenital candidiasis Reasoning: To determine the most likely cause of the rash that appears at 1 month of age and resolves naturally by 2 months in a 2-month-old infant, we need to consider the clinical presentation and natural course of the diseases listed in the options.

- Option A: Congenital candidiasis typically presents shortly after birth and is not known to spontaneously resolve within a month. It usually requires antifungal treatment.
- Option B: Congenital CMV infection can present with a rash, but it is unlikely to resolve naturally by 2 months. It often comes with other systemic symptoms like hepatosplenomegaly, petechiae, and neurological findings.
- Option C: Congenital syphilis can cause a rash, but it often persists and can be accompanied by other systemic signs such as rhinitis, hepatosplenomegaly, and bone abnormalities. The rash does not typically resolve on its own without treatment.
- Option D: Herpes simplex infection may present with a generalized blistering rash in neonates, and some cases can resolve on their own. However, herpes simplex infection can be severe and often requires antiviral treatment, especially with systemic or CNS involvement, which can lead to vomiting and poor oral intake. Given the data, the best fit for a self-resolving rash by 2 months of age among these options is congenital candidiasis, as it may manifest early and is less likely to cause severe systemic illness leading to hospitalization mainly for rash concerns. The other conditions generally do not have a natural history of resolution without medical intervention.

- 4.3 FURTHER ANALYSIS

No model excels across all tasks in the medical domain. Table 2 and Table 3 indicate that, for now, there are always trade-offs (even under the same metric) to be made when selecting a model to use in the medical domain. One example is the clinical decision support task in Table 2, o1 outperforms both GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 on most datasets, but lags far behind GPT-4 on the MIMIC4ED-Critical Triage dataset by 5% in accuracy. Interestingly, we also found the recent released open LLMLlama3 takes a lead in PMC-Patient and PICO-Intervention datasets with an unexpected 19.6% accuracy gap between o1 and Llama3 on PMC-Patient (76.4% vs. 96.0%). Nevertheless, o1 comes close to being the best in most situations, it boasts a leading position across datasets in clinical decision support, knowledge QA, and medical calculation. This claim is supported by the average

Advanced prompting can partially help models trained with CoT data. o1 was released using chain-of-thought (CoT) data embedding in the training process; however, we found that applying the CoT prompting still enhances o1’s performance on knowledge QA tasks in medicine, as shown in Table 6. The table reveals an average boost of 3.18% over the original 83.6% accuracy of o1. While this improvement is not as significant as with GPT-4, CoT proves to be a promising way for guiding

- o1 in medical tasks. However, when it comes to other fancy promptings, such as self-consistency (SC) (Wang et al., 2022) and reflex (Shinn et al., 2024), this conclusion may not stand still. We witness an average performance decline of 12.8% using these two strategies compared to only CoT
- on LancetQA (Table 7).

Hallucination remains a significant challenge. We use AlignScore (Zha et al., 2023) to evaluate hallucination in LLMs. In Table 4, the o1 model demonstrates a 1.3% decrease in AlignScore compared to GPT-4 across five text summarization datasets. Moreover, the overall improvements of o1 across three tasks (Table 4) in AlignScore significantly lag behind those of other evaluation metrics—averaging 0.7 in AlignScore compared to 9.9 in Mauve relative to GPT-4. This indicates that o1 is still susceptible to language hallucination, highlighting that such problem remains a persistent challenge in LLMs.

o1 struggles in reasoning over complex multilingual tasks. Advanced LLMs are expected to demonstrate equivalent reasoning abilities to languages other than English. However, as o1 consistently outperforms other models in multilingual QA tasks: o1 (85.2%) > GPT-4 (75.7%) > GPT-3.5 (54.1%) on average (Table 8), it falls short in a much more complex Chinese agent benchmark in Table 5—showing a 1.6% accuracy drop in the medical examinations scenario over GPT-4 (43.4% vs. 45.0%), leaving its multilingual reasoning in complex situations to be desired. This interesting outcome might be attributed to the lack of multilingual CoT data during o1’s training, as learning complex reasoning routes generally requires more efforts than plain instructions in the few-shot paradigm (Kim et al., 2023; Singh et al., 2024). We present a failure example of o1 on AI Hospital in Figure 5. We identified instances of mixed language output in the generation from the doctor, which contribute to the suboptimal performance of o1 in this context.

LLMs are facing biased judgement using different metrics. Choosing different metrics can lead to varied results of LLM evaluation (Liang et al., 2022), in our experiments, we observe a similar unaligned trend even leveraging traditional NLP metrics such as BLEU-1, ROUGE-1, and Mauve. In most cases from Table 3, o1 surpasses GPT-4 in both two traditional reference-based measurements (i.e., BLEU-1, ROUGE-1) on average. One exception arises in the BLEU-1 comparison for clinical suggestion tasks. While o1 significantly triumph over GPT-4 in ROUGE-L (24.4% vs. 17.2%), it surprisingly underperforms in BLEU-1: o1 (15.3) < GPT-4 (16.2). When considering Mauve

scores, although o1 consistently surpasses GPT-4 in both averaged BLEU-1 and ROUGE-1 for text summarization tasks, it still falls short by 2.9 points in Mauve, even when evaluated on the same output texts. A similar anomaly can also be observed in the comparison between accuracy and F1 score. While Llama3 significantly outperforms o1 in accuracy on two concept recognition datasets, it consistently falls behind o1 in F1 on the same cases. These findings underscore the urgent need to identify or devise more reliable metrics for modern LLMs.

- 5 DISCUSSION

What adverse impacts does o1 bring? The model o1 has made significant strides in both general NLP and the medical domain—as demonstrated in this paper. But what adverse impacts does o1 have on users compared to the previous generations of LLMs? While embedding the Chain of Thought (CoT) process during generation by default requires more time (OpenAI, 2024), what exactly distinguishes o1 from other OpenAI models? In Table 10, we see that o1 has more than 2× and 9× longer decoding time cost on four medical tasks compared to GPT-4 and GPT-3.5, respectively (13.18s vs. 6.89s vs. 1.41s). This increased decoding time can lead to significant waiting periods when handling complex tasks.

Additionally, o1 does not always outperform other models, with inconsistent performance across different tasks. For instance, in the concept recognition task detailed in Table 2, o1 underperforms compared to other LLMs on half of the datasets. This discrepancy may relate to recent findings suggesting that CoT data is most advantageous in more complex reasoning tasks (Sprague et al., 2024). However, in tasks that do not require complex reasoning, such as concept recognition, o1 does not have significant advantages over them.

Rethinking evaluation metrics for stronger LLMs. Traditional evaluation metrics like BLEU and ROUGE, which rely on n-gram overlap, have long been criticized for their limitations in capturing the quality of generated text, particularly for LLMs. As a result, using models like GPT-4 as evaluators, i.e., “LLM-as-a-judge”, has gained popularity for assessing the outputs of other models. However, this approach may not be valid when applied to the most advanced models such as o1, as GPT-

- 4 is even less capable and thus may produce less reliable evaluation. This is especially true for specialized domain like medicine. Therefore, there is a growing need to develop more robust and nuanced evaluation metrics that can better assess the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs in complex scenarios.

Call for reliable prompting techniques for future LLMs. As noted in Section 4.3, not all advanced prompting techniques positively impact o1’s performance. As future LLMs like o1 may continue to evolve with internal prompts for efficient user instruction, new prompting methods should consider their adaptability to existing strategies. One potential exploration could be the integration of two prompting strategies (Wang et al., 2022; Zheng et al., 2024).

Limitations. While we conduct comprehensive evaluations in the medical domain on understanding, reasoning, and multilingual capabilities, there are many other dimensions to consider such as safety (Han et al., 2024) and we leave them for future work. Additionally, we leave more advanced prompting techniques such as retrieval augmented generation (RAG) (Lewis et al., 2020) for future work, which may enhance the factuality and mitigate hallucination. It is worth noting that current GPT-like models may still underperform BERT-based specialists in classification tasks (Nori et al., 2023b). However, we focus on GPT-like generalists in this paper due to their greater flexibility as zero-shot learners.

- 6 CONCLUSION

This preliminary study assesses 3 important aspects across 35 existing and 2 novel medical datasets using the latest o1 model. It marks the first step towards a holistic evaluation of o1 in medicine, and we present our initial results, analysis, and discussion over the benchmark. The findings provide convincing evidence that o1 is narrowing the gap between AI and human doctors, shaping the vision of an ideal AI doctor closer to reality.

It uses multiple-choice questions from various sources, including translated versions for Arabic and Hindi. The task evaluates LLMs’ medical knowledge across languages, using accuracy as the primary metric.
- • AI Hospital (Fan et al., 2024) is a multi-agent framework simulating medical interactions in Chinese. We also include this dataset into the multilinguality aspect because it is in Chinese. 4www.healthcaremagic.com

- A.3 MODEL-BASED EVALUATION

As discussed in Section 5, Rethinking evaluation metrics for stronger LLMs, we also explore using techniques such as ”LLM-as-a-judge” to assess the quality of generated outputs. Table 9 shows that o1 achieves nearly the same score as GPT-4 and outperforms GPT-3.5 (i.e., 3.3% vs. 3.3% vs. 3.0%), which contrasts with the traditional evaluation metrics in Table 3. This indicates that the “LLM-as-a-judge” method may be unreliable when applied to advanced models like o1, as GPT-4, being less capable, may provide less accurate evaluations. This limitation is particularly evident in specialized domains such as medicine. The prompt used for ”LLM-as-a-judge” is shown in Figure A.3.

- A.4 DECODING TIME

We evaluated the model’s time cost and the average number of decoding tokens across various tasks, including Knowledge QA, Clinical Decision Support, Text Summary, and Concept Recognition. For each task, we select a representative dataset and perform inference on 50 samples. The time and decoded tokens are then averaged to obtain the results for each response, as illustrated in Table. 10. The decoding time for o1 is significantly higher than both GPT-4 and GPT-3.5, taking more than double the time of GPT-4 and over nine times that of GPT-3.5 across four medical tasks (13.18s compared to 6.89s and 1.41s, respectively).

- Figure 5: Failure case of o1 on AI Hospital. The model struggles with generating the right diagnosis and outputs mixed-language, resulting to its suboptimal performance in this context.

- A.5 CASE STUDY

To demonstrate how the advanced o1 model outperforms previous methods in potential clinical applications, we present comparative case studies. As shown in Figure 6 and Figure 4, when responding to questions from NEJMQA and LancetQA, o1 provides the correct answer with a more concise and precise reasoning process. In contrast, GPT-4 generates a longer reasoning path while leading to an incorrect answer. in Figure 7, when offering diagnosis and treatment based on patient records, o1 delivers a more accurate diagnosis and practical treatment plan, closely aligning with human experts and outperforming GPT-4. These cases demonstrate that o1 more closely resembles an AI Doctor.

[Figure 38]

Question: A 60-year-old left-handed woman presented to the emergency department with pain in her left forearm. The arm was swollen and tender, especially with passive pronation and supination. The overlying skin was intact, and the results of neurovascular examination were normal. Radiographs of the left forearm were performed (upper image, anteroposterior view; lower image, lateral view). The findings should raise concern for which contributory factor?

Options: A) Assault B) Fall C) Malignancy D) Osteoporosis E) Repetitive strain

[Figure 39]

[Figure 40]

Answer: A) Assault Reasoning: The patient is a 60-year-old woman presenting with swelling and tenderness in the left forearm, which is exacerbated by passive pronation and supination. The overlying skin is intact, and neurovascular examination is normal, suggesting a closed fracture without neurovascular compromise. Radiographs were performed to assess for possible fractures.

In this age group, osteoporosis is common and can lead to fractures from minimal trauma. However, osteoporotic fractures typically occur in the distal radius (Colles' fracture) after a fall on an outstretched hand. The pain with pronation and supination indicates involvement of the forearm bones rather than the wrist.

[Figure 41]

o1

An isolated fracture of the ulnar shaft, known as a nightstick fracture, results from a direct blow to the ulna. This type of injury is classically associated with a defensive action when a person raises their forearm to protect themselves from an overhead strike, often in the context of an assault. The intact skin suggests there was no penetrating injury, aligning with a blunt force trauma.

Therefore, the radiographic findings of an isolated ulnar fracture in this clinical context should raise concern for assault as the contributory factor.

[Figure 42]

[Figure 43]

Answer: D) Osteoporosis Reasoning: The patient presents with pain, swelling, and tenderness in her left forearm following some unwitnessed event, with an emphasis on particular pain during passive movements (pronation and supination), but with intact skin and normal neurovascular findings. The key elements to analyze include the patient's age, the nature of the injury, and what can be deduced from the symptoms and radiographic findings without seeing the images.

- 1. Assault: While an assault can lead to trauma presenting with pain and swelling, there is no specific evidence or context provided that indicates an assault occurred. This option might be considered if there were additional signs of defensive wounds or if the history provided such information.
- 2. Fall: A fall, especially in a 60-year-old, can easily result in fractures due to decreased bone density that comes with age. This option seems plausible since falls can cause direct trauma leading to the symptoms described. However, without explicit information about a fall or the mechanism of injury, it cannot be conclusively selected based solely on the symptoms.
- 3. Malignancy: While malignancy could theoretically present with bone pain or pathological fractures, the acute presentation in the emergency department more closely matches trauma or injury. A malignancy would likely have a more insidious onset and possibly other systemic symptoms.
- 4. Osteoporosis: In a 60-year-old woman, osteoporosis is a significant risk factor for fractures, especially with minimal or no trauma. Osteoporosis could make bones more susceptible to fracture from otherwise non-severe impacts. Given the age and gender of the patient, this is a factor that could contribute to the ease of which a fracture or injury could occur, especially under stress or minor trauma conditions that might not affect a younger individual or someone without osteoporosis.
- 5. Repetitive strain: This typically presents with soft tissue injuries rather than fractures and is more chronic in nature. The described acute presentation and radiographs (implied to show a fracture or some abnormal finding) do not fit the typical pattern of a repetitive strain injury, which more commonly affects tendons and muscles rather than resulting in acute bony injury.

[Figure 44]

GPT-4

Considering these options and reasoning, Osteoporosis seems the most plausible contributory factor to the concern raised by the radiographs. It is a common condition affecting older adults, especially women, where decreased bone density increases the risk of fractures from minimal trauma that would not typically cause injury in individuals with healthy bone density.
