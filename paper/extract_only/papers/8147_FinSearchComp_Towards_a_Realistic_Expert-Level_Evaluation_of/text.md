### Abstract

Search has emerged as core infrastructure for LLM-based agents and is widely viewed as critical on the path toward more general intelligence. Finance is a particularly demanding proving ground: analysts routinely conduct complex, multi-step searches over time-sensitive, domain-specific data, making it ideal for assessing both search proficiency and knowledge-grounded reasoning. Yet no existing open financial datasets evaluate data searching capability of end-to-end agents, largely because constructing realistic, complicated tasks requires deep financial expertise and timesensitive data is hard to evaluate. We present FinSearchComp, the first fully open-source agent benchmark for realistic, open-domain financial search and reasoning. FinSearchComp comprises three tasks—Time-Sensitive Data Fetching, Simple Historical Lookup, and Complex Historical Investigation—closely reproduce real-world financial analyst workflows. To ensure difficulty and reliability, we engage 70 professional financial experts for annotation and implement a rigorous multi-stage quality-assurance pipeline. The benchmark includes 635 questions spanning global and Greater China markets, and we evaluate 21 models (products) on it. Grok 4 (web) tops the global subset, approaching expert-level accuracy. DouBao (web) leads on the Greater China subset. Experimental analyses show that equipping agents with web search and financial plugins substantially improves results on FinSearchComp, and the country origin of models and tools impact performance significantly. By aligning with realistic analyst tasks and providing end-to-end evaluation, FinSearchComp offers a professional, high-difficulty testbed for complex financial search and reasoning.

### 1 Introduction

Search is a cornerstone capability for intelligent systems: beyond static knowledge recall, many real-world reasoning problems require agents to acquire, validate, and integrate information from diverse and timesensitive sources. Effective decision making hinges on identifying relevant signals, reconciling conflicting evidence, and synthesizing heterogeneous data into a coherent judgment. These processes represent the core intellectual skills that large language model (LLM) agents must master—information gathering, coordination, and grounded reasoning. Yet current benchmarks provide only a partial view of these skills. General-purpose browsing benchmarks such as BrowseComp [23] evaluate whether agents can persist through multi-step navigation to uncover obscure facts with short, easily verifiable answers. By design, they avoid long-form synthesis and ambiguity resolution and do not assess integration of domain knowledge or multi-source evidence, capabilities that are essential for domain-intensive decision support. As a result, they fall short of capturing the multi-step evidence acquisition and reconciliation required in high-stakes, decision-relevant settings. A natural question, then, is what environment best reveals whether agents truly possess these skills.

Finance provides a uniquely demanding answer. Analysts, regulators, and investors routinely engage in searches that combine real-time signals (e.g., market prices, exchange rates) with structured historical disclosures (e.g., annual filings, quarterly reports) and unstructured context (e.g., news events, commentaries). These tasks are time-sensitive, domain-grounded, and decision-relevant: errors in freshness, unit alignment, or source reconciliation directly affect valuations, risk management, and compliance [9, 13, 17]. Crucially, financial search is not only a high-value application but also a stress test of general cognitive skills for LLM-based agents. For example, checking “the latest close price of IBM” requires rapid retrieval and verification under freshness constraints; retrieving “Starbucks’ total assets as of September 2020” requires timestamping and accounting alignment; identifying “the month since 2010 with the largest single-month increase in the S&P 500” requires multi-period synthesis, provenance reconciliation, and error-tolerant reasoning. These examples illustrate how financial search combines timeliness, precision, and evidence integration, making it a natural proving ground for assessing whether LLMs can support realistic, high-stakes decision making.

To address this need, we introduce FinSearchComp, the first open-domain benchmark for realistic, analyst-style financial search, comprising 635 questions that require time-sensitive acquisition and multi-source evidence integration. To mirror the day-to-day needs of professional analysts, we design three task families—TimeSensitive Data Fetching, Simple Historical Lookup, and Complex Historical Investigation (Table 2). These tasks correspond to core analyst workflows. Time-Sensitive Data Fetching tasks capture situations where the correct response changes rapidly (e.g., stock prices, exchange rates, and gold prices), emphasizing rapid retrieval and verification under tight time constraints. Simple Historical Lookup tasks reflect frequent point-in-time lookups. For example, an analyst may ask “What was Apple’s iPhone revenue in Q4 2018?” or “How many employees did Google report in 2015?” These questions require going back to the correct historical disclosure and aligning with the company’s reporting calendar. Complex Historical Investigation tasks involve building multi-period views that integrate different sources. For instance, “Over the past ten years, which quarter showed the fastest growth in Tesla’s vehicle deliveries?” or “Across 2020–2022, how did Microsoft’s cloud revenue trend compared to Amazon’s?” Such queries demand stitching together multiple reports, checking consistency across sources, and ensuring that values are comparable across time.

During construction, we engaged 70 professional financial experts for data annotation, conducted multi-stage verification of prompts and reference answers, and specified detailed, rubric-based scoring guidelines. To account for differences in data sources and reporting conventions, FinSearchComp covers two subsets: Global and Greater China. Further, since answers of different LLMs may have different formats and exhibit legitimate minor fluctuations (e.g., revisions or rounding across various sources), we adopt an LLM-based evaluation with rubric-guided judging and explicit tolerance bands, complemented by expert spot checks to ensure the overall correctness.

We evaluate 21 models (products) on FinSearchComp, spanning web-enabled products and API endpoints. As shown in Figure 1, on the Global subset Grok 4 (web) attains the highest overall score (68.9%), outperforming the runner-up, GPT-5-Thinking (web), by 5.0 percentage points (pp), yet still trailing human experts by 6.1 pp. On the Greater China subset, Chinese models perform markedly better: DouBao (web) leads the leaderboard, followed closely by YuanBao-DeepSeek-R1 (web) and Grok 4 (web); nevertheless, all remain

more than 34 pp below human performance.

Further analyses indicate that equipping agents with web search capabilities and financial plugins improves their performance on FinSearchComp. A case study further reveals that poor performance often stems from insufficient search depth and the retrieval of outdated information. Our contributions are as follows:

- 1. We introduce FinSearchComp, the first fully open-source, end-to-end agent benchmark for open-domain financial data search. FinSearchComp comprises 635 expert-curated queries spanning global and Greater China markets and three analyst-style task families (Time-Sensitive, Simple Historical, Complex Historical), with multi-stage quality control.
- 2. We release a carefully curated benchmark dataset with deterministic gold answers and an fully open-source evaluation harness.
- 3. We conduct a comprehensive study of 21 models (web-enabled products and API endpoints), showing that equipping agents with web search and financial plugins consistently improves performance. Our analysis further identifies recurring failure modes: shallow search, stale or mis-timestamped evidence, cross-unit/currency aggregation, and report-calendar misalignment, offering concrete targets for future improvement. For example, common failures include neglecting to call specialized data plugins in favor of less reliable web searches, extracting incorrect data from a valid source (e.g., confusing opening vs. closing prices), and unnecessarily over-complicating simple queries like “market cap” into multiple steps.

Taken together, FinSearchComp enables us to measure, for the first time, how close LLM agents are to expert-level competence in realistic financial search. Our results show that models such as Grok 4 and GPT-5-Thinking can already approach human accuracy in certain subsets, demonstrating the remarkable progress of web-enabled LLMs. At the same time, persistent gaps in freshness awareness, multi-source reconciliation, and temporal reasoning indicate that current systems remain fragile when confronted with the full complexity of analyst-style tasks. In this way, FinSearchComp not only benchmarks performance in a critical domain, but also highlights the broader aspects of intelligence that today’s LLMs are beginning to approximate—while still falling short of the robustness, adaptability, and judgment required for reliable decision support.

Related Works. Recently, many benchmarks are proposed for evaluating browsing capabilities, while they fall short along two axes: (i) General-purpose browsing benchmarks, like BrowseComp [23], BrowseComp-ZH [27], and BrowseComp-Plus [7], are intentionally domain-agnostic and center on lookup-oriented tasks with short, verifiable targets. They optimize for findability rather than analysis: temporal validity, unit/denomination normalization, reporting-calendar alignment (e.g., TTM vs. FY vs. quarterly1), and provenance reconciliation across sources are not required, leaving them weakly diagnostic for finance-grade decision support. (ii) Financial QA-style benchmarks (e.g., FinQA [5], FinanceQA [15]) pre-collect relevant context and bypass open-domain search and tool use, thereby under-assessing agents’ search competence and diverging from analyst workflows [22, 25] (see Table 1). The Finance Agent Benchmark [3] offers an end-to-end evaluation but is confined to a

1Trailing Twelve Months, Fiscal Year, and Quarterly

self-constructed system, which is a base model augmented with a retrieval module. We advocate for a holistic evaluation that assesses the performance of web-based products. The unrestricted evaluation, which allows any search tool or source, better reflects the models’ practical utility. Moreover, the benchmark’s use of only historical data permits success via memorization, not necessarily real-time information retrieval.

### 2 FinSearchComp

We begin by outlining our design principles and choices. We then describe FinSearchComp ’s construction, quality-control measures, and some descriptive statistics.

#### 2.1 Design Principles

Before detailing FinSearchComp, we set out the desiderata for a high-quality financial search benchmark and explain how FinSearchComp addresses each.

- 1. Task professionalism & diversity. Financial data retrieval encompasses diverse task types that vary significantly in complexity and time sensitivity. These range from real-time market data queries requiring immediate responses to complex multi-period analytical investigations spanning historical datasets. Given the intricate nature of financial metrics—with nuanced distinctions in reporting standards, calculation methodologies (TTM/FY), and temporal specifications,task design and validation require careful oversight by domain experts to ensure professional accuracy and relevance.

⋆ Our design: Engaging with various professional financial analysts, we carefully design three tasks that mirror analyst’s daily workflow, namely time-sensitive data fetching, simple historical lookup, and complex historical investigation. Details are demonstrated in Section 2.2.

- 2. High quality of questions. Financial figures vary across sources, vintages, and definitions; ambiguous prompts can admit multiple “correct” answers. Without precise definitions, provenance, and reproducible grading criteria (including tolerance for legitimate minor drift due to rounding/revisions), scores reflect dataset noise rather than model ability, harming reliability and fairness. High-quality items with unambiguous targets and auditable references are therefore prerequisite for credible evaluation.

⋆ Our design: We perform a set of quality-control processes to ensure the quality of each question, including reliable data source selection, mitigating ambiguity, and multi-expert answer verification. By integrating professional financial expertise. Details are in Section 2.4.

- 3. Broad market coverage. External validity in finance depends on robustness across markets, languages, and regulatory/reporting conventions. Cross-market coverage stresses generalization under heterogeneous tickers, filing formats, calendars/time zones, and currency/denomination regimes, and surfaces failure modes that single-market tests systematically miss. This breadth is essential to assess readiness for real-world deployment rather than a narrow sandbox.

⋆ Our design: FinSearchComp comprises two subsets, Global (Western markets) and Greater China, with questions in both English and Chinese; see Section 2.5 for details. To enable fair cross-market comparison, we mirror task templates across subsets and balance entity coverage by sector and size. Bilingual questions are involved to support cross-lingual evaluation.

#### 2.2 Task Design of FinSearchComp

We define three task types aligned with daily analyst workflows. Each requires at least one external tool call, and each question has a single, fully objective answer. These tasks test core search & reasoning skills that are not only central to financial analysis but also broadly important to knowledge work in many disciplines, such as journalism, policy research, and scientific data analysis. In all domains, workers must fetch fresh information, verify point-in-time facts, and synthesize evidence across long horizons before drawing conclusions.

- T1 Time-Sensitive Data Fetching. This task type asks for data that changes daily or intraday, such as the latest close, a new filing, or a guidance update. It fits trading, monitoring, and event reactions where decisions depend on the newest number. Example: “What was Nvidia’s closing price yesterday?” ”Latest

change in Dow Jones Industrial index (based on the closing price of current and previous trading day)” This type stresses freshness management, calendar handling, ticker aliasing, and conflict resolution across sources. Similar challenges arise in real-time journalism, monitoring policy updates, or tracking clinical trial results.

- T2 Simple Historical Lookup. This task type asks for a fixed point fact, such as an issuer’s FY2024 R&D expense2 or TTM revenue3 on a given date. It supports baselining, YoY4 or HoH5 comparisons, event studies, and backtests that rely on exact values. Example: “What was Tesla’s reported revenue in Q2 2023?” The key challenges are aligning reporting conventions (FY, TTM, quarterly), handling restatements, and ensuring unit and currency fidelity. Comparable skills are crucial in policy research (e.g., retrieving census data), medicine (e.g., comparing trial endpoints), or academic meta-analysis.

- T3 Complex Historical Investigation. This task type asks for multi-period aggregation or synthesis, such as identifying the month with the largest single-month gain for a major index over a long window. It underpins trend analysis, factor research, valuation comps, and risk monitoring. Example: “Over the last 30 years, which month had the steepest decline in the S&P 500?” The challenges include retrieving across long horizons, adjusting for corporate actions, normalizing units, and composing multi-step reasoning without error. Such synthesis is equally relevant in climate science (long-horizon weather anomalies), history (identifying peak conflict years), or epidemiology (largest single-month case surges).

Detailed comparison is shown in Table 2. Together these task types cover three critical capabilities: freshness management, point-in-time fidelity, and multi-period synthesis. They mirror the actual workflows of analysts, are grounded in real data and conventions, and scale in difficulty from T1 to T3. This progression enables fine-grained error analysis and highlights how benchmarking these skills matters not just for finance, but for intelligence in knowledge work broadly.

Time Cost of Financial Analysts on These Three Tasks. Financial analysts worldwide dedicate substantial resources to these core information retrieval activities. There are approximately 370,000 financial professionals in the US (based on Bureau of Labor Statistics) and probably over 1 million globally—including equity researchers, portfolio managers, risk analysts, and investment bankers—who regularly perform these tasks as part of their daily workflow.

- For T1 (Time-Sensitive Data Fetching), analysts typically spend around 1-2 minutes per query for quick references. This task is also commonly performed by non-expert investors in scenarios such as checking the

- Figure 2 The overview of the construction process. The construction of this benchmark involves three distinct tasks. The data for each task originate from different sources and undergo separate processing pipelines. A uniform quality control procedure is applied across all tasks. current price of their investments.

- For T2 (Simple Historical Lookup) represents the most frequent task type, with individual analysts performing 10-30 such queries daily for financial analysis, peer comparisons, and modeling. Each lookup averages 5-10 minutes, accounting for data validation (faster for standard financials that can be retrieved from filings, slower for less common financial data such as operational, macroeconomic, and industry data).
- For T3 (Complex Historical Investigation) demands the highest time investment per-query, often requiring 15-60 minutes for comprehensive data retrieval and calculation, based on the complexity of the data retrieval and calculation steps. While less frequent (fewer than 20 queries per analyst monthly), these investigations and calculations are important building blocks in financial analysis and reports.

While standardized templates and automated tools already exist to facilitate these tasks—such as comparable company analysis frameworks that can be efficiently updated—approximately half of these information retrieval activities still inevitably require manual data collection and custom analytical framework development. If AI models could accurately perform such tasks, analysts could further automate these processes and significantly enhance overall productivity.

#### 2.3 Construction of FinSearchComp

To accommodate the unique characteristics of different tasks, we employ a variety of question-and-answer construction strategies to ensure both diversity and quality, as shown in Figure 2 (left side). We now detail the data collection and processing procedures for the three tasks.

For Time-Sensitive Data Fetching. Time sensitive data includes real-time stock prices, index levels, exchange rate, metal prices etc. Some of the example questions include:

- • “Latest closing price of Bloom Energy(NYSE)”
- • “The latest opening price of Starbucks”

- • “The latest percentage change of Rivian (NASDAQ), based on the latest closing price and the previous closing price”
- • “USD/THB price today”
- • “Latest price of S&P 500”

Financial experts first mannually design questions asking for time-sensitive data that can be verified through API. Time-sensitive data changes over time, so we actually prepare the code for API calls that obtain real-time data points for each question. Finally, financial experts check each API result against the real-time data to ensure the retrieved result is correct and on-time, for accurate evaluation. We establish permissible error margins for evaluation based on the specific volatility characteristics of different assets (e.g., equities, forex)

For Simple Historical Lookup. Simple historical data includes historical market data (stock price, oil price etc.), corporate financials, macro economic statistics that can be directly obtained from official sources without data processing. Some of the example questions include:

- • “What was the additional paid-in capital of Lands’ End as of the end of the fiscal year 2020? (answer in thousand dollars, rounded to the nearest integer)”
- • “What was the closing value of the VIX on April 25, 2022? (rounded to two decimal places)”
- • “For the fiscal year 2023, what was Planet Labs’ Net cash provided by investing activities? (please answer in thousands of dollars, rounded to the nearest integer)”
- • “What was the U.S. Housing Market Index (HMI) in November 2014? (answer rounded to the nearest integer)”
- • “In April 2015, what was the CPI of Russia? (base year 2015=100, rounded to two decimal places)”

We collect data for this task from two sources to enrich the diversity. (i) Financial experts select documents from official sources (e.g., listed company filings, regulatory authority websites, statistics bureau) and extract key data points to formulate questions and their corresponding answers. (ii) We also design questions using historical data with consistent definitions from professional financial databases. To mitigate the risk of data revisions for certain official statistics (e.g., macroeconomic indicators), we address potential ambiguity by setting a reasonable answer range or by explicitly specifying the reference time point in the question.

For Complex Historical Investigation. Complex historical data includes financial data that needs to be derived based on multiple historical financial data points, and requires calculation and reasoning to solve. Some of the example questions include:

- • “What were the specific dates from January 1, 2020, to December 31, 2024, when London Gold (XAUUSD) dropped by more than $80 in a single day? Please list these dates and the corresponding daily drop in USD (rounded to the nearest integer), presented in a table sorted by date in ascending order.”
- • “During April 2025, did the daily changes (compared to the previous day) in the central parity rates of EUR/CNY, HKD/CNY, and USD/CNY always occur in the same direction (i.e., all rates increasing together or all rates decreasing together)? Among the days when these rates did not move in unison, find the exact date when the USD/CNY central parity rate experienced its greatest single increase. List the three central parity rates (EUR/CNY, HKD/CNY, USD/CNY) for that specific day, rounded to four decimal places.”
- • “Which constituent stock of the Nasdaq 100 Index (NDX), with a Price-to-Earnings Trailing Twelve Months (PE-TTM) greater than 0 and less than 20 as of the market close on September 30, 2024, reported the largest operating revenue (consolidated financial statements, in billions of USD) in its 2024 interim report? Please provide the stock name and its operating revenue. Unit: billion USD, rounded to two decimal places.”
- • “What is the year-over-year change in the proportion of Johnson & Johnson’s revenue from international markets (excluding the United States) for each of the past three years (2022–2024)? Please provide the change in percentage points, rounded to two decimal places.”

The construction process involves two primary methods. (i) Financial experts design questions based on their real-world professional scenarios and get answers using reliable financial data sources. (ii) Financial experts download tables from a verified and reliable financial database and annotate questions based on the tables. Furthermore, financial experts screen and refine these candidates, finalizing 2 to 5 high-quality questions on each table and recording their definitive answers.

#### 2.4 Quality Control

To ensure FinSearchComp’s quality, we implemented a rigorous quality-control process throughout construction and summarize the key measures below.

Proficient Financial Experts. Our 70-person expert cohort is comprised of a 50-expert annotation panel and a 20-expert senior review panel. We assembled the former as a distinguished group of 50 financial experts to conduct benchmark annotations. All panel members possess advanced degrees in finance (minimum Master’s level) and maintain active professional standing within the financial services industry. Panel selection follows a stringent qualification protocol, whereby candidates undergo comprehensive domain-specific assessments to ensure annotation quality and inter-annotator reliability. The latter, our senior review panel, consists of 20 senior financial experts who handle discrepancies arising from blind review. The entire expert cohort includes practitioners from prestigious institutions such as Citadel, J.P. Morgan, Deutsche Bank, Nomura, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Harvest Fund, Zhongou Asset Management, CITIC Securities, and Huatai Securities.

Reliable Data Source Selection. To ensure the authority and accuracy of our data, all the answers are sourced from highly reliable channels, including official filings of listed companies, government and regulatory authority websites, and professional financial databases. We employ a multi-source cross-validation method to ensure data reliability and eliminate ambiguity. For instance, we cross-reference data from two different official websites or validate data from a professional financial database against an official website. Through this process, we identify that even some widely recognized professional financial databases contain inconsistencies in definitional standards or calculation errors and avoid them.

Mitigating Ambiguity. To address ambiguities arising from inconsistent calculation methods for the same metric across different institutions, we avoid questions prone to such variation. For instance, the methodologies for calculating forward-adjusted stock prices can differ significantly across data providers, and the precise definition of ’Earnings’ in Price-to-Earnings (PE) Trailing Twelve Months (TTM) ratios often varies. A more comprehensive list of such cases is detailed in Appendix A.2.

Furthermore, to ensure the unambiguity of our questions, we implement the following measures. We also summarize the detailed guide in Table 4. (i) We explicitly state definitional standards within the question itself (e.g., specifying Static PE vs. PE TTM, or Nominal GDP vs. Real GDP) and avoid metrics with ambiguous time-points, such as the prices of assets with 24-hour trading cycles. (ii) We set answers as numerical ranges or define a tolerance for precision to accommodate minor discrepancies that may arise from different calculation tools or rounding methods. (iii) We mitigate risks from data revisions by avoiding, where possible, metrics prone to retrospective adjustments (e.g., GDP, Non-Farm Payrolls). If their inclusion is necessary, we formulate the answer as a range.

Multi-Expert Answer Verification. The answer verification mechanism utilizes a blind review module. After obtaining a question and its answer, one or two other financial experts solve the question independently without access to the answer key. If discrepancies arise in the results or if an expert deems a question to be ambiguous, a senior expert arbitrates the matter. Based on the final judgment, the question or answer will be modified, or the question will be discarded entirely.

The dataset construction process encompassed approximately 180 hours of contributions from financial experts and 60 hours from senior financial experts, thereby ensuring comprehensive professional oversight throughout development.

- Figure 4, where experts annotated the topic of each question. The distribution demonstrates the diversity of FinSearchComp, which covers 10 distinct topics.

#### 2.6 Evaluation of FinSearchComp

Evaluation Protocol. Considering the dynamic nature of answers and the need for numerical tolerance in FinSearchComp, we adopt LLM-as-a-Judge [26] for evaluation. The specific evaluation methods for the three tasks are detailed below, with the corresponding prompts provided in the Appendix C.

For Time-Sensitive Data Fetching, we address several challenges: (i) time lags between the model response and the evaluation, (ii) potential data latency from some financial APIs, and (iii) the inability of most APIs to query prices at a specific second. To mitigate these time-sensitivity issues, we initiate the evaluation process uniformly after the relevant markets have closed. To ensure fairness and accuracy, we establish differentiated evaluation rubrics based on the characteristics of various asset classes:

- • Mainstream Market Stocks and Indices (e.g., U.S., A-shares, H-shares): Evaluation is conducted during non-trading hours. Only minor discrepancies attributable to rounding are permitted.
- • Other Regional Indices: An answer is considered correct if its value falls within the day’s high-low price range.
- • Foreign Exchange (FX) Rates: To account for potential discrepancies across different data providers, the valid range for an answer is defined as the high-low range of the day, augmented by an additional buffer.

For Simple Historical Lookup and Complex Historical Investigation, which feature static and deterministic answers, we also annotate rubrics, such as a predefined error margin.

Evaluation Metrics. In FinSearchComp, we employ the 0-1 error as the metric. For questions in TimeSensitive Data Fetching, we first obtain the real-time answer by executing the API commands. For questions in other tasks, the answers are static. After getting the answer, we adopt the LLM to judge referring to the rubrics. The LLM’s assessment is modeled as a judgment function, J , which maps a candidate answer and a set of rubrics to a binary outcome. Let A be the space of all possible answers and R be the space of all possible rubric sets. The judgment function J : A × R → {1,0} returns 1 if answer A ∈ A satisfies the criteria specified in rubrics R ∈ R, and 0 otherwise. The final evaluation score, S, is derived directly from the output of this judgment function. We define the score using the indicator function I(·), which formally connects the LLM’s logical evaluation to a numerical score. The score is therefore defined as follows:

S(A,R) = J (A,R). (1)

Evaluation Accuracy. To validate the reliability of LLM-as-a-Judge, we conducted a human evaluation on a representative subset. For each benchmark dataset, we selected 4–5 models and verified their complete

### 3 Experiments

In this section, we present the main results for FinSearchComp. We evaluate the performance of 22 mainstream models (products) on FinSearchComp from August 1st to 20th, and to ensure temporal comparability across models, all T1 evaluations were conducted after the official market close (local market time) on each evaluation day; these models are categorized into two groups:

- • Web-based products (12 models): Grok 4 (web) [24], GPT-5-Thinking (web)6, Gemini-2.5-pro (web) [10]7, Qwen3-235B-A22B-2507 (web)8 [19], DeepSeek-R1 (web) [8], DouBao (web) [4], DouBao-Thinking (web)9, YuanBao-HunYuan-T1-Thinking (web)10 [21], YuanBao-DeepSeek-V3 (web)11, YuanBao-DeepSeek-R1 (web)12, Ernie-X1 (web) [2], and Kimi k2 (web) [16].
- • APIs (9 models): Gemini2.5-pro (API)13, Gemini-2.5-pro (Google Search) (API)14, DouBao (API),

To establish a human performance baseline, we engage another 50 financial experts who are not involved in the data construction. These experts perform the benchmark tasks while utilizing search tools. Their average score is taken as the human baseline.

#### 3.1 Main Results

We report the overall performance of the strongest model from each provider in Figure 1, with the whole performance in Appendix B. The models form a clear performance hierarchy, with a sizable gap to human experts remaining. Rankings differ between the global and Greater China subsets, likely reflecting differences in training-corpus coverage, language/domain alignment, and retrieval infrastructure. On the global subset, Grok-4 (web) and GPT-5-Thinking form a clear leading tier, with Grok-4 (web) securing the top score and approaching expert-level accuracy. While Gemini-2.5-pro (web) decline when moving from the global to the Greater China subset, Grok 4 (web) remains competitive. On the Greater China subset, DouBao (web) and YuanBao-HunYuan-T1-Thinking (web) are strong on the Greater China subset, though they still trail human experts by a substantial margin. Detailed results and analyses are shown in Section 3.2 and Section 4.

##### 3.2 Results Across Different Tasks We show the results of each tasks respectively in Figure 5. Our main findings are as follows.

- Finding 1. Task difficulty increases from T1 to T3. Across models, performance declines monotonically from T1 (time-sensitive data fetching) to T2 (simple historical lookup) to T3 (complex historical investigation), indicating that our task design mirrors the escalating demands of professional financial-analysis workflows. This pattern demonstrates that we are probing complex search and reasoning: T3 requires multi-hop retrieval across heterogeneous sources and time periods; temporal reasoning (event dating, fiscal–calendar alignment, handling revisions/restatements); fine-grained entity resolution (issuer/ticker/subsidiary/renamed entities); and reconciliation of partial or conflicting evidence, forcing systems to plan, verify, and synthesize rather than merely retrieve. Moreover, success on T2–T3 hinges on finance-specific expertise, including interpreting primary filings and disclosures (10-K/10-Q/8-K), earnings releases and footnotes, distinguishing GAAP vs. non-GAAP metrics, and understanding corporate actions (splits, spin-offs, mergers), without which methods commonly fail via stale or misaligned time windows, misread accounting terminology, or incorrect consolidation across corporate structures.
- Finding 2. US models lead on the global set; Chinese models lead on the Greater China subset. We attribute this pattern mainly to corpus geography (English/SEC/multinational coverage vs. CN/HK/TW disclosures and regulator texts), linguistic and market conventions (domain terminology, tokenization, date and identifier formats) that ease in-region entity resolution, and alignment/recency effects, collectively boosting home-field performance without implying leakage.
- Finding 3. Despite broad underperformance versus human experts, Grok-4 and GPT-5-Thinking approaches expert-level results on the global subset. On the global subset,The outperformance of Grok-4 (web) and GPT-5-Thinking (web) over other systems becomes more pronounced on more difficult tasks (T1 → T2 → T3), with its largest margin on T3, indicating it goes beyond retrieval by performing multi-step reasoning, aligning timelines (event dating and fiscal/calendar consistency), and carefully disambiguating entities; on the Greater China subset, while aggregate accuracy still trails experts, Grok 4 (web) attains the top score on the most difficult task (T3), reinforcing that its gains reflect genuine reasoning strength rather than surface-level search.
- 4 Case Study In this section, we conduct case studies to analyze the performances in detail.

(c) Task 3. Complex historical investigation

- Figure 5 The performance of various models across the three tasks on FinSearchComp. Models with 0 scores are all APIs.

#### 4.1 How much do search capabilities impact performance on FinSearchComp?

As shown in Figure 6, models without search uniformly score 0 on T1, as they cannot retrieve current financial data. Without search, they still obtain non-zero but low scores on T2 and T3; we attribute this to parametric memory from pre-training (e.g., annual reports and statistical-agency releases), which surfaces approximate facts that are often outdated or misaligned, yielding higher error rates. With search enabled, average gains of 40.8, 29.0, and 8.1 points are observed on T1, T2, and T3, respectively—largest for time-sensitive tasks but still material for complex historical investigations.

These patterns indicate that FinSearchComp stresses complex search and reasoning, where success requires planning multi-step queries, aligning timelines and identifiers across sources, and resolving conflicting evidence. In turn, performance reflects not only access to documents but also the ability to verify, synthesize, and reason.

#### 4.2 How do financial plugins improve the performance on top of general search tools?

A comparative analysis of the performance of Deepseek R1 on the DeepSeek and YuanBao web interfaces suggests that the integration of financial plugins on the YuanBao platform significantly enhances performance on certain financial tasks, as shown in Figure 7. For T1, the financial plugin appears particularly advantageous

with 31.9 pp improvement. Standard web search functionalities could yield outdated financial data or fail to retrieve the most current information, potentially causing the model to erroneously report asset prices from previous days. A dedicated financial plugin provides direct access to simple and real-time data, which allows the model to generate more accurate summaries and reduces the likelihood of such errors. The performance on T2, also indicates improvement. The ability of financial plugin to access historical datasets, such as the income statements of publicly listed companies, contributes to a more robust and informed model output. However, the performance variation arises from both the inherent differences in the search tools employed by each platform and the specific functionalities afforded by the financial plugin on YuanBao. However, the performance of YuanBao-R1 (web) remains suboptimal even when augmented with financial plugins, as it fails to achieve a nearly 100% success rate. Therefore, the intrinsic capability of the model is also critical for searching financial data.

4.3 How does model origin impact the performance?

We compare the scores of the US models and the Chinese models on the Global and Greater China subsets in

###### Figure 8. We define asset origin ratio = Global subset scores / Greater China subset scores. Higher ratio means better performance on tasks related to global assets than tasks related to Chinese assets, and vice versa. We observe that models from US tend to show stronger data search performance for global assets, while models of Chinese origin appear more proficient with Chinese assets. This pattern suggests underlying differences in search tool integration or core model capabilities between the two groups. Specially, for tasks T1 and T2, US models consistently yield an asset origin ratio exceeding 100%. In contrast, Chinese models register a ratio below 100%. However, for task T3, a majority of models achieve a ratio greater than 100%. This implies that the global asset challenges within T3 are less demanding than the Chinese asset challenges. Additionally, among the Chinese models, Doubao and Kimi k2 achieve the highest asset origin ratios. The rank suggests their capabilities are more balanced and less skewed toward domestic assets when compared to other models from the same region.

Figure 9 Performance changes from the reasoning capability across web-based products in the same series.

#### 4.4 Where do models excel and falter on FinSearchComp?

- T1. Time-Sensitive Data Fetching. Products augmented with financial plugins, including GPT-5-Thinking (web), HunYuan-T1 (web), and DouBao (web), achieve over average 70% accuracy, demonstrating superior performance over relying solely on their underlying LLMs. We show all the corresponding cases in Appendix D. Notably, Deepseek-R1 (web) on the official Deepseek website scored only 28.8, a 12.4% reduction compared to its performance when integrated with YuanBao, underscoring the critical role of specialized data retrieval tools. Common failure modes includes non-activation of plugins, retrieval of outdated web content, and an inability to select the correct information when presented with multiple, sometimes conflicting, sources.
- T2. Simple Historical Lookup. Grok 4 (web) achieves the highest rank because of its utilization of diverse reliable search sources. Some products attempt to generate responses from parametric memory without employing search tools, frequently resulting in factual inaccuracies. Moreover, a majority of products source information from news reports rather than official filings, which often lack granular details such as prepaid expense.
- T3. Complex Historical Investigation. No product surpasses a score of 30 except Grok 4 (web) and GPT5-Thinking (web). This difficulty stems from the task requirement for structured data retrieval via API or SQL, a capability largely absent in products limited to web search. The few successful attempts are confined to queries necessitating fewer than five data points (such as, calculating the difference between two weekly closing prices for a given stock).
- 4.5 Does reasoning ability enhance performance on FinSearchComp? An evaluation of models within the same series is detailed in Figure 9. We observe an average decline of

- 7.0 points for T1 for reasoning capacity, which is likely due to the low complexity of the task and potential overthinking of reasoning models [1]. For T2 and T3, the change for adding reasoning capacity is negligible.

### 5 Related Work

Financial Benchmarks. Early efforts such as FinQA [5] and its conversational extension ConvFinQA [6] target numerical reasoning over annual reports by requiring models to compose multi-step programs that combine text and tabular evidence. Subsequent suites widened both task type and language coverage: FLUE [20] aggregated classic tasks in finance, while FinEval [11] and MultiFinBen [18] introduced largescale Chinese and multilingual collections spanning classification, extraction, generation and multimodality. Moving closer to real-world practice, FinanceQA [15] gathered zero-tolerance questions written by buy-side professionals, and BizFinBench [14] distilled 6.7K genuine queries from a popular investment-search app to probe long-context and noisy scenarios.

Collectively, existing financial datasets advance the measurement of domain knowledge, quantitative reasoning and robustness. However, these datasets provide relevant financial data by default, which substantially mitigates the challenge of financial data search from open-domain sources [23]. While Finance Agent Benchmark [3] incorporates open-domain financial data search, it is limited to searching static historical data. This design introduces the possibility of data memorization by models, thus failing to adequately evaluate their financial data search capabilities.

Agentic Benchmarks. To assess end-to-end decision-making, several works frame evaluation as goal-directed interaction with external tools. In finance, the FinEval [11] agentic track scores models on planning, API use and long-horizon reasoning across tasks such as financial question and answering, financial text classification . Beyond finance, BrowseComp [23], BrowseComp-ZH [27], and BrowseComp-Plus [7] poses questions that require persistent web navigation and creative search strategies, offering a simple yet challenging yardstick for browsing agents. These studies highlight the gap between token-level metrics and practical autonomy, motivating an evaluation that couples financial expertise with realistic tool use.

### 6 Conclusion

In this paper, we address the critical lack of an end-to-end benchmark for evaluating LLM-based agents in financial data search, as prior work failed to assess agent capabilities in realistic, context-free scenarios. To fill this gap, we introduce FinSearchComp, the first fully publicly available benchmark designed for this purpose. It comprises 635 questions curated by experts across three demanding tasks that require agents to orchestrate various tools, such as SQL, APIs, and web search, to procure verifiable answers. Our holistic evaluation reveals that even state-of-the-art agents significantly underperform humans, often failing due to insufficient search depth and the use of outdated information. We release FinSearchComp as a vital resource to drive the development of more robust and reliable financial agents.

## Appendix

### A Details of FinSearchComp

#### A.1 Release Format

The dataset is distributed as a set of JSONL files containing {id, tier, question, tool_template, answer, trace} plus an evaluation harness that replays traces in a sandboxed environment. Detailed documentation and citation files accompany the release.

#### A.2 Illustration of Inconsistent Calculation Methods for the Same Metric

- • Stock Price Adjustment: Due to significant discrepancies in the calculation of forward-adjusted and backward-adjusted prices across different databases, we uniformly query for non-adjusted prices only.
- • PE (TTM): The definition of "Earnings" can vary among different institutions.
- • Market Capitalization of Dual-Listed Companies: We either specify the calculation method (e.g., "Price 1 x Share Class 1 + Price 2 x Share Class 2" vs. "Price 1 x Total Shares") or avoid such questions.
- • Futures Contracts: The timing for switching the main contract and the algorithm for constructing continuous contracts differ across institutions.
- • Cryptocurrency: Prices vary across different exchanges.

#### A.3 Guide for Mitigating Ambiguity

Table 4 Consolidated guide for annotation in FinSearchComp for mitigating ambiguity.

Category Topic Description Bad Example Good Example

“What was NVIDIA’s revenue for fiscal year 2024?”

Calendar vs. Fiscal Year

Questions must differentiate between calendar and fiscal years. Many companies (e.g., NVIDIA) do not align their fiscal year with the calendar year. Default to “fiscal year” for consistency.

“What was NVIDIA’s revenue in 2024?”

Corporate Fundamentals

“What were the company’s total assets as of the end of fiscal year 2023?”

Timing Description for Financial Statements

Use precise language for time periods. Income statement and cash flow items occur “over a period”, while balance sheet items are a snapshot “at a point in time”.

“What were the company’s assets in fiscal year 2023?”

Financial Item Naming

The variable name in the question must match the terminology used in the financial statements to avoid ambiguity (e.g., “operating income” vs. “operating revenue”).

“What was the company’s operating revenue?” (when the report lists “operating income”)

“What was the company’s operating income?”

Continued on next page

Table 4 -- Continued from previous page Category Topic Description Bad Example Good Example

GAAP vs. Non-GAAP

To prevent evaluation mismatches, questions must specify the standard (GAAP or Non-GAAP). This ensures the ground truth and the answer are based on the same accounting principles.

“What was the company’s income?” (Ambiguous; the ground truth might be GAAP while the answer is Non-GAAP)

“What was the company’s net income, based on U.S. GAAP standards?”

Market Data

Currency To prevent evaluation mismatches, questions must specify the currency (e.g., USD, CNY). This ensures the answer can be directly compared to the ground truth.

“What was the company’s revenue?”

“What was the company’s revenue in millions of USD?”

“What industry is the company in?”

“What is the company’s industry classification according to the Shenwan Level 1 standard?”

Industry Classification

If a company’s industry is mentioned, specify the classification standard (e.g., a specific level of Shenwan or CSRC industry codes) to ensure consistency.

“What is the total market cap of the dual-listed company, calculated as (A-share price × A-share count) + (H-share price × H-share count)?”

“What is the total market cap of a company dual-listed in Hong Kong and Shanghai?”

Market Capitalization

For multi-listed companies, specify the exact calculation method. A simple “Market Cap

= Total Shares” is ambiguous; a sum of market values from each listing is precise.

The reference answer is “113.265625, but 113’08’5 is also acceptable.”

Futures Quote Notation

Futures quotes can use special hexadecimal notation (e.g., 113’08’5). The answer should accept both this format and the standard decimal equivalent to be robust.

Answer requires “113.265625” only, but “113’08’5” is also acceptable.

Fixed Income & Macro

Currency Exchange Rates

Specify the type of RMB exchange rate: onshore (CNY), offshore (CNH), or interbank, as their values differ.

“What is the USD to RMB exchange rate?”

“What is the onshore USD to CNY exchange rate as of [Date]?”

Answer Precision

Questions must specify the required precision for numerical answers (e.g., number of decimal places, rounding to nearest integer).

“What is the profit margin?”

“What is the profit margin in percentage, rounded to two decimal places?”

- B Detailed Scores on FinSearchComp We show the detailed scores of various models on FinSearchComp in Table 5.
- C Prompt This section primarily describes the judge system prompts on three subtasks.

Judge for Time-Sensitive Data Retrieval

You are a strict judge. Your task is to score a student’s response to a financial question based on the question itself, the Real-time Authentic Information I provide, and the Scoring Criteria. A score of 1 means the student’s response meets the requirements, and 0 means it does not. Please provide your analysis first, then give the final score. If the final score is 1, output ‘{"score":1}’; if it is 0, output ‘{"score":0}’. You must output strict JSON.

The specific rules are as follows:

- - If the Student Answer is empty, score 0.

- - If the Student Answer is not empty, but the data in the Real-time Authentic Information is empty (contains no numbers), output ‘{"score":"null"}’.
- - The "Scoring Criteria - Required Content" is the minimum information the student must provide. If the student’s response does not meet the Required Content (e.g., is missing content), score 0. Providing extra information is not an error and will not result in a deduction. You only need to focus on the information itself, not the time. You should not deduct points because the question asks for the "latest price" and the student only provides the "price on month x, day x."
- - The "Real-time Authentic Information" is the **correct response information** for the user’s question at the time of inquiry, and you should completely trust it. If the student’s response meets the Required Content, use the Real-time Authentic Information as the ground truth to verify the correctness of the student’s answer. Score it according to the "Scoring Criteria - Accuracy Requirements": score 1 if it meets the requirements, and 0 if it does not.
- - If the "Scoring Criteria - Accuracy Requirements" is "Only rounding errors are allowed," it means a difference between the student’s number and the real-time information is permissible if it’s caused by rounding to a different number of decimal places. For example, 12.26 vs. 12.256 is considered a match, scoring 1.
- - If the "Scoring Criteria - Accuracy Requirements" is "Any answer between the high and low price is considered correct," it means the student’s number is correct if it falls between the maximum and minimum values provided in the Real-time Authentic Information. Rounding errors are also allowed. For example, if the Real-time Authentic Information gives a high of 12.256 and a low of 12.152, a student answer of 12.26 is considered within the correct range and scores 1, while an answer of 12.27 is not and scores 0.
- - If the "Scoring Criteria - Accuracy Requirements" is "The allowable error range is an absolute value of ±xx," it means the student’s number is correct if it falls within the range of the Real-time Authentic Information’s number ±xx. For example, if the requirement is "The allowable error range is an absolute value of ±0.01%," and the number in the Real-time Authentic Information is 13.56%, then any student answer within the range [13.55%, 13.57%] is correct and scores 1; otherwise, it scores 0.
- - If the "Scoring Criteria - Accuracy Requirements" is "Expand the high-low price range by an absolute value of a," the correct range is from "minimum value - a" to "maximum value + a" based on the Real-time Authentic Information. Note:
- - You only need to verify numerical values like stock prices/indices, not dates. As long as the numerical values are correct, the student’s response is considered correct. You should not deduct points if the student’s response mentions "latest/yesterday" while the reference information specifies a particular date (e.g., "Month X, Day Y"), nor should you deduct points if the dates do not align (due to potential issues with time zones, trading days vs. calendar days, etc.). The following examples use fictional dates and numbers. So do not refer to the specific figures.

- Example 1: <Question>: How is NVDA’s stock market performance today? <Scoring Criteria>: Required Content: NVIDIA’s latest opening price, high price, low price, and change percentage. Accuracy Requirements: Only rounding errors are allowed <Real-time Authentic Information>: { "data": { "symbol": "NVDA", "open": "112.905", "high": "114.665", "low": "112.660", "price": "113.820", "latest_trading_day": "20250426", "previous_close": "114.500", "change": "-0.680", "change_percent": "-0.59%" } } <Student Answer>: According to the latest news as of 17:47 Beijing time on April 27, at the close of the most recent U.S. trading day, NVIDIA’s (NVDA) stock price fell by 0.59%.

On that day, NVIDIA’s opening price was $112.91, the high was $114.67, the low was $112.66, the volume was 130 million, and the turnover was $15.15 billion. The after-hours price was $113.28, down $0.54 from the closing price, a decrease of 0.47%. <Your Output>: Analysis: Does the student’s answer meet the Required Content: Yes; Are the numbers consistent (allowing for rounding errors): The opening, high, and low prices are consistent, with

only rounding errors; The student’s answer about the change percentage (-0.47%) is not consistent with the real-time information’s "change_percent": "-0.59%". Not all requirements are met, final score is 0;

- Final score: {"score":0}

Example 2: <Question>: USD/CNY onshore exchange rate <Scoring Criteria>: Required Content: The latest onshore USD/CNY exchange rate Accuracy Requirements: Any answer between the high and low price is considered correct <Real-time Authentic Information>: { "currency_pair": "USD/CNY", "exchange_per": "-0.0403", "exchange_range": "-0.0029", "exchange_rate": "7.1871", "exchange_rate_hi": "7.1934", "exchange_rate_lo": "7.1855", "open_exchange_rate": "7.1900", "pre_close_exchange_rate": "7.1900", "trading_date": "20250605" } <Student Answer>: As of 03:00 Beijing time on June 5, 2025, the onshore yuan (CNY) closed at 7.1905 against the US dollar, down 26 points from the previous trading day’s night session close, with a trading volume of $36.094 billion.

Additionally, on June 5, 2025, the central parity rate of the RMB in the inter-bank foreign exchange market was 7.1729 yuan per US dollar, an appreciation of 32 basis points from the previous trading day. <Your Output>: Analysis: Did the student answer the Required Content: Yes; Does the number meet the accuracy requirement: The threshold range from the real-time information is [7.1855, 7.1934]. The student’s answer, 7.1905, falls within this range and meets the requirement.

- Final score: {"score":1}

- Example 3: <Question>: Latest COMEX gold price <Scoring Criteria>: Required Content: Latest COMEX gold price Accuracy Requirements: The allowable error range is an absolute value of ±0.6 <Real-time Authentic Information>: { "res": { "request": "w.wsq("GC.CMX","rt_date,rt_time,rt_last")", "code": 0, "data": { "GC.CMX": { "RT_DATE": 20250619, "RT_TIME": 90628, "RT_LAST": 3383.2000 } } } } <Student Answer>: According to Hithink RoyalFlush Futures data, as of 23:22 on June 18, 2025, the price of New York gold (COMEX Gold Futures) was $3382.7 / ounce, down $25.4 from the previous trading day, a decrease of 0.75%, with a high of $3405.2 / ounce and a low of $3363.6 / ounce. <Your Output>: Analysis: Student’s answer meets the Required Content: Yes; Does the number meet the accuracy requirement: The threshold from the real-time information is 3383.2000 ± 0.6, which is [3382.6000, 3383.8000]. The student’s answer, 3382.7, falls within this range and meets the requirement. Final score: {"score":1}

========End of examples, this is your task========

###### Judge for Single Historical Data Point Retrieval and Complex Data Retrieval

You are an intelligent judge and scorer for answers to financial questions. You will receive a <Question>, its <Reference Answer>, and a <Student Answer>. Some <Reference Answer>s may be supplemented with "Scoring Criteria". You need to evaluate the <Student Answer> and complete the following tasks:

- 1. Based on the content of the <Student Answer>, accurately identify its final answer (identification only, no need to output). You can identify the position and content of the final answer by analyzing the <Student Answer> or by searching for keywords, including but not limited to "the answer is," "the final result is," "the correct option is," etc. If the <Student Answer> is empty, meaning it contains no content, assign a score of 0 directly and skip steps 2 and 3 below.
- 2. Separately list the final answer from the <Reference Answer> and the final answer you identified from the <Student Answer>, and compare the two (no need to output the listing and comparison process or results).
- 3. Based on the result of the comparison and any Scoring Criteria that may be provided with the <Reference Answer>, judge whether the <Student Answer> is correct and assign a score. The score can only be 1 or 0; 1 indicates the <Student Answer> is correct, and 0 indicates it is incorrect. No scores other than 0 and 1 are permitted.

**Notes:**

- 1. You do not need to and should not answer or solve the question yourself. Your sole task is to judge and score.
- 2. The <Reference Answer> is accurate and correct. You can fully trust it.
- 3. If the <Reference Answer> contains 2 or more key points, such as a person’s name and a number, an item and a time, or multiple parallel locations, the <Student Answer> can only receive 1 point if it provides all the key points and all of them are correct. If only a portion of the key points are provided or are correct, the score is 0.
- 4. If the <Student Answer> is empty or an abnormal error message, please assign a score of 0.
- 5. Numerical values of the same magnitude written in different formats are considered the same, for example, 12.45% vs

- 0.1245, or 120,400,000 vs 120.4 million, or 2/5 vs 0.4. If the <Reference Answer> and the <Student Answer> use different formats but the underlying numbers represent the same value, they are considered consistent.

6. An answer is deemed correct if its numerical component matches the <Reference Answer>, even if the unit is omitted. For example, if the <Question> asks for "xx revenue in billions of yuan", a <Student Answer> of "12.98" is a valid match for the <Reference Answer> "12.98 billion yuan". Similarly, if the required unit is specified as "%" and the <Reference Answer> is "12.98%", a <Student Answer> of "12.98" is also a valid match.

**Regarding your output format:** You need to first output the evaluation result, then provide the scoring basis and the score. Your output format is:

- - Scoring Basis: (Briefly state your reason for the score, not exceeding 150 words or 150 tokens)
- - JSON: “‘ {"answer_score": your score} “‘ ###

- **Example 1** <Question>: What is the average number of years it took for the C9 League university presidents who spoke at the 2024 graduation ceremonies to become a president of a university for the first time after receiving their PhD? (Calculate in years, round to one decimal place) <Reference Answer>: 27.9 years Scoring Criteria: The number in the Student Answer must be strictly identical to the number in the Reference Answer. <Student Answer>: Based on known information, the average time for the current presidents of C9 League universities to become a president for the first time after their PhD is approximately 27.3 years. Here is the specific calculation:

- 1. Peking University: President Gong Qihuang, PhD in 1992, became president in 2022, a gap of 30 years.
- 2. Tsinghua University: President Wang Xiqin, PhD in 1996, became president in 2022, a gap of 26 years.
- 3. Fudan University: President Jin Li, PhD in 1994, became president in 2021, a gap of 27 years.
- 4. Shanghai Jiao Tong University: President Ding Kuiling, PhD in 1990, became president in 2021, a gap of 31 years.
- 5. Nanjing University: President Lü Jian, PhD in 1993, became president in 2018, a gap of 25 years.
- 6. University of Science and Technology of China: President Bao Xinhe, PhD in 1991, became president in 2017, a gap of 26 years.
- 7. Xi’an Jiaotong University: President Wang Shuguo, PhD in 1986, became president in 2014, a gap of 28 years.
- 8. Zhejiang University: President Wu Zhaohui, PhD in 1993, became president in 2015, a gap of 22 years.
- 9. Harbin Institute of Technology: President Han Jiecai, PhD in 1991, became president in 2022, a gap of 31 years. Summing the years:

30 + 26 + 27 + 31 + 25 + 26 + 28 + 22 + 31 = 246 Average time: 246 ÷ 9 = 27.3 years Therefore, on average, it took these presidents approximately 27.3 years to become a university president for the first time after their PhD.

- - Scoring Basis: This question has Scoring Criteria, which require the number in the Student Answer to be strictly identical to the number in the Reference Answer. Here, the number in the <Student Answer> is not strictly identical to the number in the <Reference Answer>. Therefore, the <Student Answer> is incorrect, and the score is 0.
- - JSON: “‘ {"answer_score": 0} “‘

###

- **Example 2** <Question>: An interesting aspect of the United States is that a state’s political center is often not its economic center. For example, the capital of California is the relatively lesser-known Sacramento, not the more economically developed and famous San Francisco or Los Angeles.

###### Question

How much cash was used in investing activities by Apple in the 2021 fiscal year? (Answer in millions of dollars, rounded to nearest integer)

Reasoning The user needs to know the amount of cash used in investing activities by Apple in the 2021 fiscal year, in millions of dollars, rounded to the nearest integer. First, I need to recall Apple’s financial reports, specifically the cash flow statement for the 2021 fiscal year. Apple’s fiscal year typically ends in September, so the 2021 fiscal year would be the year ending September 2021. According to public financial data, in Apple’s 2021 cash flow statement, the net cash flow from investing activities is usually negative because investment expenditures exceed income. The "cash used" here refers to the net amount of total cash outflows from investing activities minus inflows, but typically "cash used" in a question refers to the net cash outflow from investing activities. Consulting Apple’s 2021 10-K report, the investing activities section includes capital expenditures (like PP&E), acquisitions, investment securities, etc. From memory, was the net cash outflow from investing activities for Apple’s 2021 fiscal year approximately 144,266 million dollars? Or is more accurate data needed. Confirming again, in Apple’s 2021 fiscal year cash flow statement, the net cash flow from investing activities was -144,266 million dollars. This means the cash used for investing activities was 144,266 million dollars. So the answer should be 144266.
