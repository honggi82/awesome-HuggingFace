Abstract
Active computer vision promises efficient, biologically plausible perception through
sequential, localized glimpses, but lacks scalable general-purpose architectures and
pretraining pipelines, leaving Active-Vision Foundation Models (AVFMs) underex-
plored. We introduce CanViT, the first task- and policy-agnostic AVFM. CanViT
uses scene-relative RoPE to bind a retinotopic Vision Transformer backbone and a
spatiotopic scene-wide latent workspace, the canvas. Efficient interaction with this
high-capacity working memory is supported by Canvas Attention, a novel asym-
metric cross-attention mechanism. We decouple thinking (backbone-level) and
memory (canvas-level), eliminating canvas-side self-attention and fully-connected
layers to achieve fast sequential inference and scalability to high output resolu-
tions. We propose a label-free active vision pretraining scheme, policy-agnostic
passive-to-active dense latent distillation: reconstructing scene-wide DINOv3
embeddings from sequences of low-resolution glimpses with randomized locations,
zoom levels, and lengths. We pretrain CanViT-B from a random initialization on
13.2 million ImageNet-21k scenes—an order of magnitude more than previous
active models—and 1 billion random glimpses, in 166 hours on a single H100. On
ADE20K segmentation, a frozen CanViT-B achieves 38.5% mIoU in a single low-
resolution glimpse, outperforming the best active model’s 27.6% with 20x fewer
inference FLOPs as well as its FLOP- or input-matched DINOv3 teacher. Given
additional glimpses, CanViT-B reaches 45.9% ADE20K mIoU. On ImageNet-1k
classification, CanViT-B also sets a new active-vision state of the art, with 84.5%
top-1 accuracy after fine-tuning. CanViT generalizes to longer rollouts, larger
scenes, and new policies. Our work narrows the wide gap between passive and
active computer vision, demonstrating the potential of task- and policy-agnostic
AVFM pretraining.

Introduction
Deep Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have achieved outstanding performance in a variety of
computer vision tasks, and proven valuable to life sciences research as computational models of
biological visual processing1–7. This practical and scientific success has largely hinged on vision
encoders which process individual frames independently and passively, without the ability to reuse
previous computation to guide further processing in a recurrent, active, human-like manner.
Unlike most ANNs, humans sample their visual environment by actively and frequently orienting
their sensory apparatus towards regions of interest (ROIs), through gaze shifts. This process is
inherently sequential, and involves strategic planning8,9, integration of evidence across time in visual
working memory10,11, and top-down recurrent feedback—rich conditioning of early visual pathways
by signals from higher brain areas, allowing each fixation’s visual information to be processed in a
contextually informed manner, based on what was seen earlier12–14, rather than tabula rasa.

Figure 1: A CanViT rollout. We consider a high-resolution scene (A). At each timestep t, CanViT
ingests a 1282 px glimpse (B, 1st row), a crop extracted at a viewpoint with center (xt, yt) ∈[−1, +1]2
and scale (zoom level) st ∈(0, 1]. This updates a scene-wide latent representation, the canvas, with
which CanViT integrates broad context and fine detail from variable-scale glimpses, extrapolates
to unobserved regions, and conditions visual processing on a working understanding of the scene.
We visualize the canvas via Principal Component Analysis across tokens (B, 2nd row), and canvas
updates (∆) as cosine dissimilarity heatmaps across consecutive timesteps (B, 3rd row).
Drawing inspiration from human vision, various Active Computer Vision (ACV) models, which
process visual scenes through sequential, localized glimpses, have been proposed15–30. These models
often seek biological relevance and computational efficiency. Yet, despite their theoretical advantages,
they have struggled to match the accuracy, efficiency, flexibility and representational richness of
their passive counterparts. This disconnect is particularly striking on dense prediction, which is
unsupported by most existing active vision models; the few exceptions lag dramatically behind
passive models on standard benchmarks like ADE20K segmentation31 when evaluated on it24,25.
An active vision model can be considered along three axes: making sense of what it sees at a given
moment (instantaneous vision); updating a persistent, evolving understanding of the scene, which
may in turn inform further processing (memory); and deciding where and at what zoom level to look
next (action selection). The first two axes define an observer’s ability to understand, persist, and
recall visual inputs, while the last defines its input-selection strategy, or sensory policy. They do not
play comparable roles: given perfect instantaneous vision and memory, naive and strategic policies
should reach the same accuracy after enough glimpses of a static scene, but no policy can make up
for a poor observer. Yet, prior ACV work has often focused on action selection15–27. Concurrently,
passive-vision foundation models like DINOv332 excel at general-purpose instantaneous vision but
lack essential active-vision components, as they have no concept of localized glimpses or memory.
Focusing on the intersection of instantaneous vision and memory, we sought to build a task- and
policy-agnostic Active-Vision Foundation Model (AVFM): a vision model capable of understanding
the spatial and semantic structure of scenes across arbitrary sequences of glimpses, with rich repre-
sentations that transfer across tasks and viewing policies. This policy-agnostic approach disentangles
“how to see in an active-vision setting” from “where to look,” thus freeing active-vision pretraining
from the complexity of Reinforcement Learning (RL). Policy agnosticism may also be desirable for
real-world deployment, where physical limitations (e.g., a motorized camera’s range of motion and
optical zoom levels) may preclude the use of a general-purpose policy.
Contributions. We introduce the Canvas Vision Transformer (CanViT, Figure 1), a recurrent
architecture built around a latent scene-wide representation called the canvas (§4) and pretrained
with a novel passive-to-active distillation scheme (§5). We evaluate CanViT-B on ADE20K semantic
segmentation and ImageNet-1k33 classification (§6). CanViT-B sets a new state of the art among
active vision models on both ADE20K and ImageNet-1k while transferring across policies, temporal
horizons, and canvas resolutions without retraining.

Deep active vision models typically process sequences of glimpses—fixed- or variable-scale crops
extracted from a larger image or video. This line of research traces back to the Recurrent Attention
Model15, and remained largely confined to simple tasks such as digit recognition16,18 until 2019, when
Saccader19 achieved 75% ImageNet-1k33 top-1 accuracy by introducing an intermediate pretraining
step to stabilize learning. GFNet20 and AdaptiveNN26 later showed that active vision could deliver
computational efficiency gains on real-world tasks, although both remained structurally limited to
classification tasks and fixed zoom levels.
Dense prediction in active vision has remained underexplored, as most ACV architectures cannot
produce the scene-wide, spatially dense outputs required in tasks like semantic segmentation or
depth estimation. Among the few exceptions, AME24 and AdaGlimpse25 achieve dense prediction
through post-hoc expansion of encoder outputs: at each timestep, a MAE-style34 Transformer decoder
receives all encoded glimpse tokens with a full grid of learnable mask tokens and performs self-
attention over the entire grid to produce scene-wide predictions. This becomes intractable at high
scene resolutions, where active vision is most appealing. Despite being the state of the art on active
ADE20K segmentation, these models respectively achieve only 27.6% and 25.7% mIoU.
Dense latent distillation from self-supervised ViTs allows the visuospatial intelligence acquired
through extensive pretraining to be quickly transferred into randomly-initialized models. The largest
DINOv235/v332 models were distilled into smaller ViTs using the same dataset and objective as
during pretraining. Proteus36 distilled DINOv2-{g,L}/1435 into a smaller model using 100× less data
than during pretraining and a simple loss combining CLS token matching with dense feature matching.
Our distillation scheme follows a similar philosophy to Proteus, but transfers across problem settings
rather than across model sizes: we use a passive teacher’s visual world knowledge to teach an active
student how to see from arbitrary glimpse sequences.
Cross-attention for dimensionality/computation decoupling was pioneered by the Set Trans-
former37, popularized by Perceiver models38,39, then generalized to iterative bidirectional routing by
Recurrent Interface Networks (RINs)40. Like RINs, CanViT alternates read and write cross-attention
across depth and time. Unlike Perceiver and RINs, CanViT ingests external input on its few-token
side (glimpse), with latents on the many-token side (canvas). Moreover, CanViT’s many-token side
forgoes not only self-attention, but also all fully-connected layers: canvas tokens never go through
Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), QKVO projections in cross-attention, or GRU41/LSTM42 recurrent
gates. Instead, canvas tokens evolve solely via our Canvas Attention mechanism.
Latent-space recurrent reasoning iterates over a fixed external input in a weight-tied fashion,
decoupling representational capacity from computational depth to enable improved algorithmic
reasoning43–47 and flexible test-time compute allocation48,49. This paradigm has recently seen
renewed interest, both in the Large Language Model (LLM) space50,51 and for its ability to produce
small yet highly capable models46,47. Leveraging top-down recurrent feedback allows previous
computation to be reused, without losing most of it to ephemeral step-wise outputs. Active vision
offers an opportunity to generalize this framework by allowing each processing step to benefit from a
new perspective on the scene instead of operating on a constant input. CanViT achieves latent-space
recurrent reasoning with a semantically rich (rather than pixel-like) workspace, the canvas, which
provides top-down recurrent feedback for early layers to build upon.

Preliminaries
Definitions: Scenes, Glimpses, Viewpoints. For a timestep t ∈N, we consider a bounded 2D scene,
which can be formally represented as a function ψt : [−1, +1]2 →R3 mapping continuous-valued
(x, y) coordinates to RGB values. In our experiments, we consider static scenes, with ψt = ψ0 for all
timesteps. We define a glimpse as a fixed-resolution crop, extracted at a viewpoint vt = (xt, yt, st),
where (xt, yt) ∈[−1, +1]2 is the crop center in scene coordinates and st ∈(0, 1] is the crop’s scale,
or half-side-length. That is, the crop spans the scene coordinates [xt −st, xt + st] × [yt −st, yt + st],
covering a fraction s2
t of the scene’s surface area. Regardless of its scale st, the crop is resized to a
fixed resolution of Hg × Wg pixels, which determines its information capacity; under that constraint,
st smoothly controls the tradeoff between spatial coverage and perception of detail.
3

General-Purpose, Spatially-Grounded Active Vision. We wish for our model to build up a general-
purpose understanding of the scene through a sequence of glimpses that it perceives, allowing
each additional processing step to build upon and refine this understanding. This evolving latent
representation should be readily decodable into predictions at every timestep, whether for non-spatial,
global prediction tasks like object classification or spatially-grounded, dense tasks like semantic
segmentation or depth estimation. Dense predictions require explicit architectural handling, as the
active vision setting breaks the direct, connectivity-based mapping between input and output feature
maps that passive Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and ViTs commonly exploit: glimpses
need not align with the scene from which they are extracted.
To address this problem, we introduce the Canvas Vision Transformer, or CanViT (§4), a recurrent
vision architecture built around a scene-wide latent representation called the canvas.

Figure 2: CanViT architecture diagram. We adopt a dual-stream structure, equipping a ViT
backbone (purple, left-hand columns), which processes localized glimpses (blue), with a canvas
(red, right-hand columns), a fine-grained scene-wide spatio-semantic memory. At each timestep
t, a glimpse is extracted from a viewpoint vt = (xt, yt, st), patchified, and processed through the
backbone, alongside a recurrent CLS token (green) and a Viewpoint Encoding (VPE) token (orange).
The canvas regularly interacts with the glimpse stream via Canvas Attention (Figure 3), alternating
between read (R) and write (W) operations to, respectively, condition the backbone’s processing on
the canvas and populate the canvas. Both streams are equipped with register tokens (gray)52.
The CanViT architecture (Figure 2) formulates active-vision processing as the interaction between
a high-capacity memory stream (the canvas) and a ViT53 backbone’s compact glimpse processing
stream. These streams interact bidirectionally through Canvas Attention (Figure 3), a mechanism that
allows the backbone to efficiently pull information from the canvas and send updates to it.
4

The glimpse stream, made up of Dbb-dimensional glimpse tokens, is largely ephemeral. Each
glimpse is extracted from the scene at a given viewpoint, split into 162 px patches, and fed to the
backbone alongside ephemeral register tokens52, a recurrent CLS token, and a viewpoint encoding
(VPE) token derived from the glimpse’s position and zoom level. Since spatial alignment between
consecutive patch grids cannot be assumed, as a glimpse may be taken from any position and at
any zoom level, patch tokens cannot be directly forwarded across time without destroying their grid
structure. Instead, CanViT persists relevant information from glimpses via the canvas stream.
The canvas stream, made up of Dcan-dimensional canvas tokens, is fully persistent. The canvas acts
as a scene-wide spatio-semantic memory, which can function as a cognitive map54 of the scene. It
comprises a few canvas registers, which act as a non-spatial memory, and a large H × W spatial grid
of canvas patches tiling the [−1, +1]2 scene coordinate space. At the start of each rollout, this grid is
broadcasted to the desired size from a single learnable initial patch, enabling the canvas resolution to
be set at inference time. Each canvas patch maps onto a fixed scene region, regardless of the current
viewpoint, thus allowing direct token-wise decoding into dense predictions and unbroken gradient
flow across time. After initialization, the canvas is read from and written to by consecutive Canvas
Attention layers, whose outputs are residuals injected into each stream. No MLPs or self-attention
layers are applied to canvas tokens, which evolve solely by interacting with the backbone’s glimpse
tokens via Canvas Attention Write operations. This restriction is key to CanViT’s efficiency, as the
canvas stream is designed to accommodate a much larger number of tokens than the glimpse stream.
Scene-Relative Rotary Position Embeddings (SR-RoPE). We compute 2D RoPE55,56 from the
centers of glimpse patches and canvas patches in the scene’s [−1, +1]2 coordinate system, both in the
ViT backbone’s self-attention and in Canvas Attention layers. The positions of glimpse patch centers
depend on the current viewpoint (xt, yt, st), with their relative distances implicitly communicating
the viewing scale st (zoom): a zoomed-in glimpse’s patches are tightly clustered in a small scene
region, while a zoomed-out glimpse’s tokens span a wider region (Figure 1). The positions of canvas
patches are constant for any given canvas grid size, since they uniformly tile the scene. Consistent
use of scene-relative coordinates binds the retinotopic glimpse stream and the spatiotopic canvas
stream with a shared reference frame, while RoPE enables generalization across patch grid sizes.
Canvas Attention (Figure 3A; pseudocode in Appendix A), a mechanism based on cross-attention,
enables efficient interaction between CanViT’s relatively small set of glimpse tokens and its much
larger set of canvas tokens, allowing CanViT to support fine-grained scene/canvas grids without
incurring the quadratic cost of self-attention (Figure 3B). We alternate between Read and Write
operations along depth (and, implicitly, time) using a stride of 2 ViT blocks in CanViT-B. In a Read,
glimpse tokens query the canvas; in a Write, canvas tokens query the glimpse. In both cases, the
cross-attention output is added back to the querying stream via residual addition. SR-RoPE makes
this process spatially aware, allowing Canvas Attention to bind the two streams. Unlike standard
cross-attention implementations (e.g. MultiHeadAttention in PyTorch57 or Flax NNX58,59), Canvas
Attention is asymmetric: it restricts Query, Key, Value and Output (QKVO) projections to one token
set (glimpse-side tokens), applying only LayerNorm, RoPE (for Queries/Keys) and element-wise
residual addition to the other one (canvas-side tokens).
Asymmetric projections. The glimpse token count Ng must be kept low due to the quadratic cost of
the ViT backbone’s self-attention, and it is desirable for the canvas to have high information capacity
both spatially, by tiling the scene in a fine-grained manner with a large number H × W of canvas
patch tokens (making up the bulk of the Ncan canvas tokens), and semantically at any given position
within the scene, with a large canvas embedding dimension Dcan. This makes the asymmetric design
of Canvas Attention highly advantageous, as the FLOP footprint of a single canvas-side projection
relative to the Scaled Dot Product Attention (SDPA) call that it accompanies would be:
projection FLOPs
SDPA FLOPs
=
2NcanD2

2Ng
,
(1)
which is a 7.2× ratio with Dcan = 1024 and Ng = 71 (64 glimpse patches, 5 registers, and CLS +
VPE tokens). The FLOP savings from asymmetric cross-attention projections are magnified when
using fewer glimpse patches and more canvas patches (Figure 3C). In CanViT-B, with a 64 × 64
canvas patch grid, adding canvas-side QKVO projections would increase the cost of each Canvas
Attention Read/Write pair from 2.8 to 37.3 GFLOPs.
Viewpoint Encoding (VPE) Token. We supplement SR-RoPE, which distributes the encoding of
viewpoint position and scale over glimpse patches, with a dedicated viewpoint encoding (VPE) token

that concentrates the viewpoint triplet (xt, yt, st) into a single glimpse-side token. The VPE token
is a non-essential architectural affordance, meant to facilitate future end-to-end policy learning by
allowing the next viewpoint to be decoded from a rich transformation of the current viewpoint. We
provide additional details on VPE in Appendix B and ablate it in Table 12 k.

Policy-agnostic passive-to-active dense latent distillation
An active vision model should (1) make sense of what it sees, (2) integrate observations into a
persistent scene representation, and (3) decide where to look next. Here, we ask: how can we
teach CanViT (1) and (2) in a task-agnostic, spatially aware, label-free manner, while remaining
robust to the choice of policy (3)? We achieve this via policy-agnostic passive-to-active dense latent
distillation, which combines highly informative reconstruction targets with rollout randomization.
5.1
Passive-to-active dense distillation
A natural pretext task for active-vision pretraining is scene reconstruction: training the model
to produce a best-guess approximation of the overall scene from a sequence of glimpses. This
incentivizes understanding of the spatial and semantic structure of scenes, in order to faithfully
extrapolate to unseen regions and details. Since we wish for CanViT to iteratively build a semantically
rich “mental image,” we formulate this reconstruction objective in DINOv332 latent space, rather
than in pixel space like passive Masked Autoencoders (MAEs)34 and some active vision models25.
Teacher. We build upon DINOv332, a self-supervised vision model family whose dense representa-
tions deliver outstanding frozen-feature transfer to classification, segmentation, depth estimation, and
other downstream tasks. We use DINOv3 ViT-B as a high-resolution scene-wide spatio-semantic
teacher, which produces patch tokens (dense features) and a global CLS token. These highly infor-
mative reference embeddings represent an idealized scene understanding for CanViT to match using
sequences of cheap, partial glimpses. High-resolution teacher inference is much more computation-
ally intensive than a single CanViT forward pass; however, since the teacher is frozen, we precompute
reference features once, storing them for subsequent use across epochs and hyperparameter sweeps.
We apply per-position z-score standardization to reconstruction targets.
Decoding. At each timestep t, CanViT produces updated canvas tokens, including canvas patches
Ct ∈RH×W ×Dcan and canvas registers, and an updated CLS token ht ∈RDbb. We apply layer
6

normalization60, then decode into DINOv3-space reconstructions via token-wise linear projections:
ˆZt = WC · LayerNorm(Ct),
ˆzt = Wh · LayerNorm(ht)

Policy agnosticism
Dual rollouts. For each scene, we run two independent rollouts from a freshly-initialized canvas,
averaging their losses. These rollouts and their viewpoint sampling policies are referred to as R-IID
and F-IID, which only differ by their behavior at t = 0. R-IID (Random-then-IID) rollouts sample
random viewpoints at all timesteps, including t = 0, ensuring robustness to arbitrary rollout starts.
F-IID (Full-then-IID) rollouts always start with the full-scene zoomed-out viewpoint (x0, y0, s0) =
(0, 0, 1), providing a low-resolution but high-spatial-coverage view of each scene at least once over
the course of pretraining. Training with 1 F-IID + 1 R-IID rather than 2 R-IID rollouts accelerates
convergence, even when evaluating on held-out data with a R-IID policy (Table 12 h).
Sampling of viewpoint center and scale. For all non-initial timesteps, as well as the t = 0 timestep
of R-IID rollouts, we sample A ∼U([0, Amax]) and set s = 1 −
√
A. For a glimpse of scale
s, valid centers form a box of half-side-length
√
A, within which we draw (x, y) uniformly. The
resulting marginal scale density is p(s) ∝(1 −s), favoring small, localized glimpses. We set
Amax = (1 −smin)2 with a minimum glimpse scale of smin = 0.05, or 0.25% of the scene’s area.
Rollout length randomization. Our loss provides temporally dense supervision, with per-timestep
credit assignment. This allows us to train CanViT with truncated Backpropagation Through Time
(BPTT) over chunks of only K = 2 glimpses. At each chunk boundary, we stop the rollout with
probability pstop = 0.5, resulting in a geometric distribution of chunk counts with an average sequence
length of T = K/pstop = 4 glimpses while occasionally exposing the model to longer sequences.
This scheme ensures sequence length robustness on a constant train-time VRAM footprint, with a
modest train-time compute overhead due to the low average sequence length.

Experiments
To assess generalization across tasks, policies, temporal horizons, and canvas resolutions, we pretrain
a general-purpose CanViT-B checkpoint and evaluate it with linear decoding on ADE20K31 semantic
segmentation and ImageNet-1k (IN1k) classification33. We use frozen weights to assess feature
decodability on ADE20K and IN1k, and full fine-tuning to measure peak IN1k performance; we do
not fine-tune on ADE20K due to its low scene count. We use 1282 px glimpses consistently. We
provide additional details on pretraining (Appendix C) and evaluation (Appendix D), as well as a
detailed ablation study (Appendix E) and inference latency measurements (Appendix F).
Task-agnostic pretraining. Following the protocol described in §5, we pretrain CanViT-B from a
random initialization in just 166 hours on a single H100, sampling approximately 1 billion glimpses
from 13.2 million 5122 px ImageNet-21k33,61 scenes. We use an average sequence length of T = 4
(via pstop = 0.5 and K = 2) and a canvas resolution of 322 = 1024 patches during pretraining.
Task-specific probing. For ADE20K, we train linear probes to predict segmentation masks from
canvas patches. We train a separate probe for each considered canvas resolution. For ImageNet-1k,
we use a linear probe to predict logits from CanViT’s recurrent CLS token. When fine-tuning, we
start from our frozen-weights probes and unfreeze CanViT’s own weights (i.e. LP-FT62).
Baselines. We consider leading active vision models with published results on ADE20K segmentation
and/or ImageNet-1k classification: Saccader19, AME24, AdaGlimpse25, and AdaptiveNN26. We
report each model’s best published results; for AME, we include both its SETR63 and MAE34-
initialized variants for completeness. When assessing the effects of canvas resolution and ground-truth
mask area, we also compare against the DINOv3 ViT-B passive teacher.
Policies. To assess CanViT’s ability to generalize across policies, we supplement the R-IID and F-IID
train-time policies described in §5.2 with additional inference-time-only policies. We introduce a

Coarse-to-Fine (C2F) policy, which traverses a quadtree over the scene, deterministically decreasing
the viewpoint scale as the rollout progresses while randomizing the visitation order at each scale.
To isolate the effect of processing order, we pair C2F with the Fine-to-Coarse (F2C) policy, which
reverses C2F viewpoint sequences. For ADE20K, we also introduce an Entropy-Guided C2F
(EG-C2F) variant, which greedily selects the highest-uncertainty tile among those that have not
yet been visited at a given scale, using the segmentation probe’s per-position class entropy. This
image-dependent dynamic policy showcases the ability of the canvas to guide viewpoint selection,
even without RL. Lastly, to disentangle the impact of additional recurrent processing from that of
ingesting different inputs, we consider a Repeated Full-Scene (RFS) policy, which simply iterates
over the (x, y, s) = (0, 0, 1) zoomed-out viewpoint. We use up to T = 21 glimpses.

on both ADE20K segmentation and ImageNet-
1k classification by a wide margin (Table 1),
achieving up to 45.9% ADE20K mIoU (up from
27.6%) and 84.5% IN1k top-1 accuracy (up from
82.2%). On ADE20K, state-of-the-art accuracy is
paired with striking efficiency: in a single glimpse,
CanViT-B reaches 38.5% mIoU using 20x fewer
FLOPs than AME does at 27.6% mIoU (Fig-
ure 4A). CanViT’s advantage holds even with the
F2C policy’s worse-than-random viewing order,
showing that perception, not viewpoint selection,
was the bottleneck in this task.
On both tasks, CanViT-B generalizes across poli-
cies, temporal horizons, and canvas resolutions,
even with frozen weights (Figure 4B,C). The inference-time-only C2F policy dramatically outper-
forms the R-IID and F-IID policies on ADE20K in both peak accuracy and efficiency, and provides a
modest efficiency boost early into IN1k rollouts. EG-C2F’s uncertainty-based viewpoint selection
enables further efficiency gains on ADE20K. We observe consistent ADE20K mIoU gains through
T = 21 glimpses, well beyond the average of T ≈4 used during pretraining, while IN1k accuracy
quickly plateaus. On both tasks, CanViT reaches higher peak accuracies with C2F than F2C de-
spite both policies yielding the same set of viewpoints by t = 20, highlighting the importance of
contextually informed processing. Given a constant input (RFS), accuracy initially improves purely
from recurrent processing, then subsequently declines in the absence of diverse viewpoints. Despite
training exclusively with a 322 canvas, evaluating CanViT-B with an inference-time 642 canvas
consistently provides an accuracy boost on ADE20K, an effect that we probe further in Figure 5.

Figure 5: Effects of canvas resolution and ground-truth mask area. We evaluate on ADE20K
segmentation with canvas resolution in {82, 162, 322, 642}, using the EG-C2F policy, frozen weights,
and per-resolution linear probes. A. Per-mask IoU given a single full-scene 1282 px input (82 input

varying FLOPs via timestep count for CanViT and via input resolution (px) for DINOv3.
CanViT’s dual-stream design decouples glimpse (instantaneous vision) resolution from canvas
(memory/output) resolution. This input-output dissociation can be advantageous even in single-
timestep (passive vision) contexts: given a low-resolution full-scene glimpse, a frozen CanViT-B with
a finer canvas outperforms its coarser-canvas counterpart on ADE20K segmentation, and even its
input-matched DINOv3-ViT-B teacher (Figure 5A). Finer canvases are most beneficial when dealing
with small ground-truth segmentation masks (e.g., for small, distant or occluded objects) (Figure 5A)
or using multiple timesteps (Figure 5B). Together, the accuracy gains provided by finer canvases
and the low computational overhead of Canvas Attention allow CanViT-B to offer an attractive
accuracy-efficiency frontier on ADE20K segmentation at low FLOP budgets (Figure 5C).

Conclusion
CanViT applies the foundation model playbook to active vision, with a general-purpose active-
vision model that can be used as-is across tasks and viewing policies while delivering outstanding
performance. Our results show that pairing a carefully designed active-vision architecture with
a highly informative learning signal is sufficient to dramatically advance the state of the art in
active computer vision, without relying on complex RL pipelines. Together, CanViT’s strong
inference-time generalization, high computational efficiency and state-of-the-art performance on
active-vision benchmarks highlight the potential of our approach and of task- and policy-agnostic
AVFM pretraining.
Limitations and future work. Like most active-vision models, CanViT was trained and evaluated
on static scenes. However, its constant-memory recurrent design and high computational efficiency
make it an ideal candidate for future adaptation to real-time video processing and embodied active
perception. In those contexts, the addition of a lightweight gating mechanism may be desirable
in order to facilitate forgetting. Similarly, RL-based policy learning would be a natural extension,
particularly in goal-directed settings such as visual search; we leave this to future work. We expect
CanViT-B to be directly applicable to monocular depth estimation without retraining, similarly
to its DINOv3 teacher and passive models distilled from DINOv2/v3 features36. Our passive-to-
active distillation scheme accelerates active-vision pretraining by allowing it to remain focused
on active-vision-specific considerations such as partial observability and information integration
across glimpses, but requires a pretrained passive teacher. This may prove limiting at very high
scene resolutions due to the quadratic cost of teacher self-attention and the large storage footprint of
precomputed features, especially when working with video, which would involve distinct per-timestep
targets. We thus see active-to-active self-distillation as a promising avenue for future research. Finally,
our results use a single model size pretrained using a modest compute budget and a dataset over 100×
smaller than DINOv3’s LVD-1689M; we expect further gains from more extensive pretraining and
larger models, though the latter may be undesirable for edge deployment.

B
Viewpoint Encoding (VPE)
The VPE token is instantiated by first encoding the current viewpoint (x, y, s) as the triplet
(x/s, y/s, log s), a parameterization with scale invariance, same-scale translation invariance, and
planar isotropy properties (proven below). We then lift this triplet into RDbb via Random Fourier
Features (RFF)64, and apply layer normalization60 before letting the backbone process it alongside
the other glimpse tokens (patches, registers, and recurrent CLS token).
B.1
Definitions: scene, viewpoint, crop
We consider a finite 2D scene whose (x, y) coordinates span [−1, +1]2.
We call a viewpoint a triplet (x, y, s) ∈Vraw such that the corresponding square crop,
[x −s, x + s] × [y −s, y + s],
lies inside [−1, +1]2. Equivalently,
Vraw = { (x, y, s) ∈R2 × (0, 1] : |x| ≤1 −s, |y| ≤1 −s }.
For instance, the viewpoint (0, 0, 1) spans the entire scene; the viewpoint (0.5, 0.5, 0.5) spans the
quadrant [0, 1]2; the viewpoint (2, 2, 0.5) is invalid, as its center lies outside of the scene; the
viewpoint (0.5, 0.5, 1) is also invalid, even though its center lies within the scene, because its borders
extend beyond the scene boundaries.
B.2
Finding a scale-invariant representation
While the above representation of a viewpoint as a triplet (x, y, s) ∈Vraw is simple to understand and
uniquely defines crops within the scene, it fails to represent an important property: scale invariance.
When considering viewpoints as vectors, we would like distances between viewpoints to be invariant
to global rescaling. In other words, the distance between two side-by-side square crops should be
identical regardless of zoom level; equivalently, a 10% zoom of the scene should leave any pairwise
viewpoint distance unchanged. This is not the case in a straightforward (x, y, s) encoding, which
becomes artificially insensitive to shifts in position and scale for small crops (i.e. when s ≪1),
thus being forced to under-represent fine detail at small scales, leading to loss of information, or
over-represent it at large scales, leading to ill-conditioned representations with excessive sensitivity
to small perturbations at large scales (when s ≈1).
Beyond scale invariance, two further properties are natural: same-scale translation invariance, so
that at a fixed zoom the encoding distance depends only on the relative offset between viewpoints,
and planar isotropy, so that the encoding does not privilege a particular axis orientation. Because the
scene is bounded, these properties are stated for transformations whose resulting viewpoints remain
valid crops. We thus seek a smooth, injective u : Vraw →V that, equipping V with the Euclidean
distance d inherited from R3, satisfies all three.
We propose the embedding u : Vraw →V = u(Vraw) ⊂R3 defined by
u : Vraw →V
(x, y, s) 7→(x/s, y/s, log s) = (u1, u2, u3)
u−1 : V →Vraw
(u1, u2, u3) 7→(exp(u3)u1, exp(u3)u2, exp(u3)) = (x, y, s).
The component functions are smooth for s > 0, and the displayed inverse shows that u is injective.
B.3
Properties of u
Throughout, qi = (xi, yi, si) ∈Vraw and d is the Euclidean distance on V ⊂R3.
Lemma B.1 (Pairwise distance identity). For qi = (xi, yi, si) ∈Vraw,
d(u(q1), u(q2))2 = ∥u(q1) −u(q2)∥2
2
= ∥(x1/s1 −x2/s2, y1/s1 −y2/s2, log s1 −log s2)∥2
2
= (x1/s1 −x2/s2)2 + (y1/s1 −y2/s2)2 + (log s1 −log s2)2.
18

Proof. Direct computation from the definition of u and the Euclidean norm on V ⊂R3.
Proposition B.2 (Scale invariance). For all c > 0 such that cqi = (cxi, cyi, csi) ∈Vraw for i = 1, 2,
d(u(cq1), u(cq2)) = d(u(q1), u(q2)).
Proof. Let c > 0 and qi = (xi, yi, si). By the definition of u,
u(cqi) = (xi/si, yi/si, log si + log c),
so the additive log c cancels in the difference:
u(cq1) −u(cq2) =
x1
s1
−x2
s2
, y1
s1
−y2
s2
, log s1 −log s2

.
Setting c = 1 in this identity yields u(q1) −u(q2) component-wise; the two difference vectors are
therefore equal, hence so are their norms.
Proposition B.3 (Same-scale translation invariance). With (x1, y1, s), (x2, y2, s) ∈Vraw, for any
planar offset (∆x, ∆y) ∈R2 such that (x1 + ∆x, y1 + ∆y, s) and (x2 + ∆x, y2 + ∆y, s) lie in Vraw,
d(u(x1 + ∆x, y1 + ∆y, s), u(x2 + ∆x, y2 + ∆y, s)) = d(u(x1, y1, s), u(x2, y2, s)).
Proof. By Lemma B.1,
d(u(x1, y1, s), u(x2, y2, s))2 =
x1 −x2
s
2
+
y1 −y2
s
2
,
and
d(u(x1 + ∆x, y1 + ∆y, s), u(x2 + ∆x, y2 + ∆y, s))2 =
(x1 + ∆x) −(x2 + ∆x)
s
2
+
(y1 + ∆y) −(y2 + ∆y)
s
2
=
x1 −x2
s
2
+
y1 −y2
s
2
.
The two right-hand sides agree.
Proposition B.4 (Planar isotropy). For any Q ∈O(2), with (xi,Q, yi,Q, si) ∈Vraw for i = 1, 2
denoting the transformed coordinates (xi,Q, yi,Q) = Q(xi, yi),
d(u(x1,Q, y1,Q, s1), u(x2,Q, y2,Q, s2)) = d(u(x1, y1, s1), u(x2, y2, s2)).
Proof. By Lemma B.1,
d(u(x1, y1, s1), u(x2, y2, s2))2 = ∥(x1/s1, y1/s1) −(x2/s2, y2/s2)∥2
2 + (log s1 −log s2)2.
For any Q ∈O(2),
d(u(x1,Q, y1,Q, s1), u(x2,Q, y2,Q, s2))2 = ∥Q(x1, y1)/s1 −Q(x2, y2)/s2∥2
2
+ (log s1 −log s2)2
= ∥Q((x1/s1, y1/s1) −(x2/s2, y2/s2))∥2
2
+ (log s1 −log s2)2
= ∥(x1/s1, y1/s1) −(x2/s2, y2/s2)∥2
2
+ (log s1 −log s2)2,
where the second equality uses linearity of Q, and the third uses orthogonality ∥Qv∥2 = ∥v∥2 for all
v ∈R2. The result follows.

CanViT-B pretraining details
Hyperparameters. We list architectural hyperparameters in Table 2, and ImageNet-21k pretraining
hyperparameters in Table 3. Similarly to DINOv3 ViTs, we use LayerScale65 in the ViT backbone.
Precomputation of teacher features. To eliminate the repeated cost of the teacher’s forward pass
during training, we precompute DINOv3 ViT-B features for all 13.2 million ImageNet-21k images at
5122 px input resolution, which corresponds to a 32 × 32 patch grid. Images are processed without
augmentation (resize shortest side to 512 px, center crop). We performed this one-time export in
parallel over many MIG 1g.10gb H100 instances, with a small total footprint of approximately 8
H100-equivalent hours for our entire training set. We store features in float16, totaling approximately
19 TiB, and organize them into shards of 4096 images each. Each shard contains whole-scene dense
patch features and CLS tokens, both obtained after DINOv3’s final LayerNorm. Per-position z-score
standardization statistics (mean and variance for each spatial position and embedding dimension)
are precomputed from a representative sample of 4096 images. We pre-shuffle shards during dataset
export, enabling us to process the shards themselves sequentially during pretraining. This strategy
enables high-bandwidth streaming from networked storage, without incurring the high cost of a
random data access pattern.
Numerical precision considerations. The use of mixed-precision training is critical for efficiency,
but comes with numerical correctness considerations, particularly in long-horizon scenarios. Over the
course of this project, we encountered several subtle correctness issues, which only led to meaningful
regressions after several hundred thousand steps of pretraining. For safe CanViT pretraining with
minimal performance impact, we keep the canvas in float32 as it accumulates updates across time and
depth, and keep all coordinate-related components in float32: grid coordinates, RoPE computations,
VPE token projection matrix and creation. Other operations, including SDPA operations and learned
projection layers, can be safely performed in bfloat16, following standard autocast operator rules. We
perform the backward pass outside of the AMP region, setting backward_pass_autocast="off"
accordingly when using torch.compile.

Viewing policies
Full-i.i.d. (F-IID) and Random-i.i.d. (R-IID) are described as part of our pretraining scheme
(Section 5). F-IID begins with a full-scene viewpoint (s = 1) then samples i.i.d. random crops,
whereas R-IID samples i.i.d. random crops at all timesteps, including t = 0.

Coarse-to-Fine (C2F) traverses a quadtree over the scene from coarse to fine. At level ℓ≥0, the
viewpoint scale is sℓ= 2−ℓ, tiling the scene into a 2ℓ× 2ℓgrid of non-overlapping crops. Let Vℓ
denote the ordered set of viewpoints at level ℓ; within each level, we visit tiles in a random order
σℓ(Vℓ) (where σℓis an independent random permutation). The full sequence is the concatenation
V0, σ1(V1), σ2(V2), . . ., truncated to the glimpse budget T.
Fine-to-Coarse (F2C) reverses C2F viewpoint sequences. For any given glimpse budget, F2C starts
from the finest level and progresses toward coarser views. After identical image coverage, the C2F
vs. F2C comparison isolates the effect of processing order.
Entropy-Guided C2F (EG-C2F) is a variant of C2F that prioritizes informative regions at each scale
level. Rather than visiting tiles in random order, EG-C2F ranks them by the Shannon entropy of the
per-position class distribution predicted by the segmentation probe, visiting high-entropy (uncertain)
tiles first.
Repeated Full-Scene (RFS) repeats the viewpoint (x, y, s) = (0, 0, 1) at every timestep. It serves as
a recurrence-only control: any improvement over t = 0 must come from iterative canvas refinement
with a fixed glimpse input.
D.2
FLOP counting
We count each multiply-add (MAC) operation as two floating-point operations (FLOPs). We sourced
architecture parameters for DINOv332, AME24 and AdaGlimpse25 from the corresponding papers
and code releases.† To obtain fine-grained FLOP curves, we computed FLOP counts analytically,
following the same standard formulas as PyTorch’s flop_counter module. We validated our total
counts end-to-end against traced FLOP counts as well as previously-reported FLOP counts, which
were published for DINOv3 but not for AdaGlimpse or AME.
D.3
Task: ADE20K segmentation
Probe training. Each probe consists of dropout66 (p = 0.1), batch normalization67, and a linear
classifier in the form of a 1 × 1 convolution. For CanViT, this head is preceded by a layer normal-
ization60 and applied to canvas patches. For the DINOv3 baselines, the head is applied directly to
the feature map, as the DINOv3 features that we consider are already layer-normalized. We train
for 40,000 steps with AdamW with peak learning rate 3 × 10−4 and weight decay 10−3, under a
1,500-step linear warmup followed by cosine decay, at batch size 16. Training-time augmentations
†https://github.com/facebookresearch/dinov3, https://github.com/apardyl/AME,
https://github.com/apardyl/AdaGlimpse
21

are random scale-jittered 5122 crops (scale factor in [0.5, 2.0]) and horizontal flips. During CanViT
probe training, glimpse viewpoints are drawn i.i.d. under the R-IID policy across T = 10 timesteps.
Evaluation. Similarly to our active-vision ADE20K baselines24,25, we resize all images and masks to
a fixed size (here, 512 × 512). We apply this preprocessing consistently when evaluating CanViT-B
and DINOv3 ViT-B, ensuring a fair comparison between the models. Across up to T = 21 timesteps,
we report ADE20K mIoU by policy and timestep at canvas grids 32 × 32 and 64 × 64 on Figure 4B
and Table 4. Table 5 reports best-t mIoU at canvas grids c × c for c ∈{8, 16, 32, 64}.

D.4
Task: ImageNet-1k classification
Probe training. As the DINOv3 authors did not release ImageNet-1k classification heads for models
other than their 7B-parameter flagship, we trained and released our own linear probes for all five
smaller ViT variants (§D.6). Since CanViT-B was pretrained to predict DINOv3 representations, it
is possible to use a DINOv3-fitted probe with it. We initialize the linear classification head applied
to CanViT-B’s recurrent CLS token by algebraically fusing three consecutive affine transforms
(CanViT’s pretrained CLS projection, CLS destandardization, and our DINOv3 ViT-B IN1k linear
probe) into a single LayerNorm →Linear layer.
Fine-tuning. For ImageNet-1k full fine-tuning, we start from an already-fit frozen classification head
then unfreeze CanViT and fine-tune all model and head parameters end-to-end, a two-stage approach
known as LP-FT (linear probing then fine-tuning)62. We train for 20 epochs with AdamW (peak
learning rate 2.5×10−5, weight decay 1.0×10−4, gradient clipping at 1.0 max norm), batch size 256,
and label smoothing 0.1. The learning rate follows a linear warmup over 25,000 steps then cosine de-
cay to zero (100,080 total steps). Training images are augmented with RandomResizedCrop(5122 px,
scale ∈[0.2, 1.0]) and horizontal flips. Each step processes T = 4 F-IID glimpses with full backprop-
agation through time. We performed this fine-tuning step on TPU v6e-4 hardware using torch_xla
and SPMD for multi-chip parallelism.
Evaluation. When evaluating on the ImageNet-1k33 validation set, we preprocess images by resizing
the shortest side to 512 pixels followed by a center crop. Across up to T = 21 timesteps, we report
frozen CanViT-B IN1k top-1 accuracy by policy and timestep at canvas grid 32 × 32 on Figure 4C
(frozen curves) and Table 6. Table 7 reports best-t top-1 at canvas grids c × c for c ∈{8, 16, 32, 64}.
We report fine-tuned CanViT-B IN1k top-1 accuracy by policy and timestep on Figure 4C (fine-tuned
curves) and Table 8. Canvas resolution has only a marginal effect on best-t top-1 on IN1k (Table 7),
unlike on ADE20K (Table 5).

Methodology for Figure 5 analyses
Panels A and B. We evaluate the impact of canvas resolution on ADE20K segmentation performance,
notably examining how IoU varies as a function of ground truth mask size. To do so, we collect all
(scene, class) pairs from the validation set (i.e., where the ground-truth mask is non-empty). For the
mask corresponding to each such pair, we measure its area as the ratio between mask and scene pixels
and compute per-mask IoU with the predictions from frozen DINOv3 and frozen CanViT-B models.
Unlike the class-level mIoU reported elsewhere, per-mask IoU is computed for each non-zero mask
instance rather than by summing pixels across the full validation set, and consequently does not
consider false positive predictions from scenes where the class is absent.
We use 1282 px input images for DINOv3 and CanViT-B models in Figure 5 A–B. To obtain a desired
output resolution, we fix CanViT-B’s canvas resolution to 82, 162, 322, or 642 at inference. DINOv3’s
output resolution is determined by its input resolution; with its 162 px patch size, it produces an 82
feature map. Each model-resolution pair under consideration is evaluated with its own independently

trained linear probe, yielding four CanViT-B probes (one per canvas resolution) and one DINOv3
probe. This pipeline produces one (scene, class, mask area, timestep, IoU) datapoint per ground-truth
mask per model. For CanViT, timesteps range from t = 0 to t = 20 under an EG-C2F policy. At
t = 0, Table 9 reports the corresponding passive comparison against DINOv3 ViT-B/16 (our passive
teacher) and DINOv3 ViT-S/16.
To compute the trends shown in Figure 5 A–B, we select the first timestep (A) or a difference
of timesteps (B) and apply locally-weighted scatter-plot smoothing to the scatter of (mask area,
IoU) datapoints, using the Python package statsmodels68 with a smoothing fraction of 0.25. We
disable iterative-based reweightings (i.e. we set it = 0) to prevent outliers from being artificially
downweighted. The 95% confidence intervals were computed with 1,000 bootstrap resamples.
Panel C. For CanViT-B, we sweep the EG-C2F glimpse budget from t = 0 to t = 20 at four canvas
resolutions (82, 162, 322, 642), producing one curve per grid. For DINOv3 ViT-B/16, we sweep
input resolution over 128, 144, 160, 192, 256, 384, and 512 px, with one independently trained linear
probe per resolution. Figure 6 visualizes CanViT-B mIoU at canvas grids c × c (c ∈{8, 16, 32, 64})
under the C2F policy across all T = 21 timesteps.

DINOv3 ImageNet-1k linear classification probes
DINOv332 was released with a pretrained ImageNet-1k linear classification head only for the 7B-
parameter flagship model, not for the smaller ViT checkpoints (ViT-S/16, ViT-S+/16, ViT-B/16,
ViT-L/16, ViT-H+/16). Additionally, only ImageNet-ReAL top-1 accuracy, rather than standard
ImageNet-1k top-1 validation accuracy, was reported for those non-flagship checkpoints. We trained
linear probes for all five smaller DINOv3 ViT models, which all match or exceed the best IN1k-ReAL
top-1 validation accuracy reported by the DINOv3 authors (Table 10).
Feature extraction. We extract CLS tokens from the last transformer layer of each DINOv3 ViT
model at 512 × 512 input resolution (1024 patch tokens with 16 × 16 px patches), using bfloat16
automatic mixed precision for the forward pass. CLS tokens are stored in float32. Data loading
uses Inception-crop augmentation for the training split. Features are pre-computed and cached to
disk before any probe training begins. This decouples the expensive backbone forward pass from
the probe optimization, which iterates over cached feature vectors rather than running the backbone
or loading images. This makes extensive hyperparameter search over the full training set practical.
Since augmentation is applied at extraction time and baked into the cached features, each extraction
run through the training split (with different random shuffling and augmentation) produces a separate
file. To train with N augmentation epochs, N extraction passes must be run and stored. During probe
training, each file is treated as an independent epoch.
Hyperparameter (HP) search. For each backbone, we sweep the following HPs with Optuna69 to
maximize ImageNet-ReAL top-1 validation accuracy70: loss (softmax or sigmoid cross-entropy);
optimizer (AdamW or SGD); reference learning rate (10−7 to 10−2, log-uniform); batch size (one of
the top three powers of 2 fitting in GPU memory for that backbone); AdamW weight decay (0 to 0.1,
uniform), β1 (0.1 to 0.99, log-uniform), and β2 = β1 + g(1 −β1) with g ∈[0.01, 1.0] log-uniform
(ensuring β2 > β1); SGD momentum (0 to 0.99, uniform); and weight initialization (Gaussian
N(0, 0.01) with zero bias, or PyTorch default). The peak learning rate is the reference learning rate
times the batch size (linear scaling rule), with linear warmup over the first 10% of steps followed by
cosine annealing to zero. We report selected HPs in Table 11.

Figure 7: Ablation study: loss curves during ImageNet-21k pretraining. Faint lines: logged
per-batch losses. Bold lines: exponential moving average of logged losses.
To assess the influence of our design choices at the level of architecture and pretraining, we conducted
an ablation study using short pretraining runs. For our ablation baseline and each ablated variant,
we allocated approximately 215k optimizer steps (slightly over 10% of our flagship checkpoint’s
pretraining compute), with a learning rate warmup of 20k steps.
We report training loss curves on Figure 7, disaggregated by reconstruction target (patch/CLS) and
by policy (R-IID/F-IID). As our chosen step count results in slightly more than 1 epoch on the 13.2
million ImageNet-21k images in our pretraining dataset, these training curves are representative of
the model’s generalization capabilities.
To further quantify generalization, we evaluated each ablation variant on the ADE20K validation
set by measuring cosine similarity between the canvas reconstruction and DINOv3 ViT-B teacher
features under the R-IID policy. We report the relative change compared to baseline on Table 12,
alongside computational footprint and parameter count, with 95% CIs and t = 0 results in Table 13.
Capacity–expressiveness trade-offs. The removal of canvas-side QKVO projections is key to the
low overhead of Canvas Attention. On any given training or inference budget, this allows for more
frequent canvas–backbone interactions, a larger canvas embedding dimension (semantic resolution),
and the use of more canvas patches (spatial resolution). However, at fixed canvas dimensionality, the
ablation of these projections reduces the expressiveness of each individual cross-attention operation.
To assess the well-foundedness of this trade-off, we reduced canvas dimensionality from Dcan = 1024
to Dcan = 256, leading to a dramatic drop in patch reconstruction quality (−12.0%, Table 12 a).
Re-introducing canvas-side QKVO projections in a FLOP-matched manner forces the use of a small
canvas, resulting in a loss of per-position information capacity and a failure to rescue reconstruction
quality via increased expressiveness (−11.7% and −5.8% respectively, Table 12 b,c).

Frequency and directionality of canvas–backbone interaction. CanViT interleaves Canvas At-
tention Read/Write operations along depth. In CanViT-B, this corresponds to 3 reads and 3 writes
per glimpse (R/W stride of 2), evenly spread across its ViT-B backbone’s 12 Transformer blocks.
Write operations are required in order to update the canvas and produce dense outputs. In contrast,
Read operations can be readily ablated; doing so results in a large drop in both patch-level (−6.6%)
and CLS-level (−8.0%) reconstruction quality (Table 12 d). This highlights the benefit of canvas-to-
backbone communication, which underpins top-down recurrent feedback across timesteps, indirect
canvas-to-canvas interaction via the backbone, and generally allows backbone-side computation
to benefit from the high-capacity workspace constituted by the canvas. When increasing the R/W
stride from 2 to 6 Transformer blocks, which results in just 1 read and 1 write per glimpse, we
observe a similar yet slightly less pronounced effect (−4.0%, Table 12 e). Together, these results
28

show the benefits of frequent, bidirectional Canvas Attention operations, and point at the importance
of within-glimpse canvas refinement and contextually-aware backbone computation.
Dense latent supervision. Omitting dense supervision is contrary to the goal of using a frozen
CanViT’s canvas features for dense tasks. However, this objective-level intervention has no effect on
the model’s architecture or raw expressiveness, and could theoretically enhance CLS reconstruction
by allowing the model’s representations to be specialized for this purpose, rather than requiring them
to support both CLS-level and patch-level reconstruction. In our ablation study, the reverse was true
(−9.0%, Table 12 f): removing patch-level supervision degrades CLS reconstruction, indicating that
the patch-level objective also benefits CLS-level learning rather than competing with it for capacity.
F-IID rollouts. During pretraining, we average losses and gradients across two rollouts that start
from a random (R-IID) or full-scene zoomed-out (F-IID) viewpoint for each scene. The inclusion
of a F-IID rollout ensures that at least one glimpse has full spatial coverage and that the full-scene
viewpoint, (x = 0, y = 0, s = 1), can be seen during training. Simply removing the F-IID rollout
(−9.4% spatial, Table 12 g) dramatically slows down the decrease of the R-IID loss; however, this also
halves the total number of glimpses per optimizer step. To control for this, we trained a second variant
that replaces the F-IID rollout with a second R-IID rollout, preserving the total number of glimpses
per step (Table 12 h). The controlled variant still incurs a substantial degradation (−5.2% spatial,
−9.2% CLS), confirming that the full-scene viewpoint itself is beneficial, beyond its contribution as
an additional rollout.
Temporal credit assignment. CanViT uses the smallest possible truncated BPTT chunk size, K = 2,
in order for gradient updates to take into account a glimpse and its successor. Setting K = 1 roughly
halves the backward-pass memory footprint, but eliminates gradient flow across time altogether.
Given temporally-dense supervision and highly-informative canvas tokens, it may still be possible
to obtain meaningful results with K = 1, as the model learns to greedily produce a best-guess
reconstruction at each timestep, which incidentally produces an informative canvas for the next
timestep to reuse. In this ablation, we also decrease the stop probability from 0.5 to 0.25 to keep
the expected number of glimpses per optimizer step comparable. We find that removing BPTT
(Table 12 i) degrades both spatial (−3.9%) and CLS (−7.5%) reconstruction, indicating that even
minimal temporal gradient flow (K = 2) contributes meaningfully to learning.
Backbone embedding dimension. Reducing the backbone embedding dimension from Dbb = 768
to Dbb = 384 is exactly equivalent to using a ViT-S backbone, rather than ViT-B. This results in
the largest drop in parameter count, per-glimpse computational footprint, and CLS reconstruction
quality (−21.1%) across all ablations. However, the impact of a narrower backbone on patch (spatial)
reconstruction (−8.4%), while significant, remains lower than that of several other ablations.
VPE token. Among all considered ablations, the removal of the VPE token had the lowest impact
across both policies and both loss types (−0.1% spatial, −0.2% CLS; Figure 7, Table 12 k), consistent
with its role as an architectural affordance for future extensions of CanViT to end-to-end policy
learning rather than as a key component of the proposed architecture.

We report minimum latency and peak memory scaling in Figure 8 and Table 14. Benchmarks run
on an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 and on an AMD Ryzen 9 7950X 16-Core Processor. CUDA
benchmarks use both float32 and AMP bfloat16, and torch.compile. CPU benchmarks use float32
in eager mode, with 1 thread or 16 threads (the physical-core count).
Each timed iteration processes a single input (batch size B = 1) with explicit device synchronization
both before and after. After 3 warmup iterations, measurement runs at least 5 iterations and continues
until either a 20-second budget or a 500-iteration limit is reached, whichever comes first. We repeat
each configuration 3 times and pool the per-iteration latencies. Within the measurement window, we
record peak GPU memory and minimum forward-pass latency. To vary the scene grid size during
benchmarking, we adjust the canvas resolution for CanViT and the input (and thus, output) resolution
for DINOv3, as in Figure 5 and Appendix D.5.

Interpretability
PCA Visualizations. To visualize grids of high-dimensional glimpse or canvas patch tokens as RGB
images (Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 9), we adopt a similar approach to that of DINOv332,
by performing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) across tokens then mapping groups of three
consecutive PCs to RGB. In order to prevent global variance from washing out local detail when
visualizing a subset of the canvas, we apply min-max scaling to the resulting RGB channels across
the visible region. We apply this protocol to layer-normalized60 tokens, such that each individual
token has unit variance and zero mean across its dimensions.

Figure 9: Canvas updates within and across glimpses. CanViT performs multiple Canvas Attention
Write operations per glimpse, each producing a residual that is summed with the canvas (Figure 2).
To isolate the contribution of individual Write operations, we capture intermediate residuals and
canvases after each Write operation within a 1282 px glimpse, and visualize these snapshots with
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) across tokens. We compute PCA bases independently for all
snapshots rather than using a shared basis, in order to visualize the spatial structure of each individual
snapshot. We observe an emergent progression in the spatial structure of residuals as within-glimpse
processing unfolds from Write 0 to Write 2, from localized and feature-level content to scene-wide
and semantically grounded content. Write-0 residuals reflect the structure of the glimpse’s 8 × 8
patch grid. Write-1 residuals begin to reflect the structure of the objects within the glimpse. Write-2
residuals extrapolate beyond the confines of the glimpse, and delineate sharper object boundaries.

Availability of code and data
Our primary code repository is https://github.com/m2b3/CanViT-PyTorch. We release all of
our code under the MIT license under the m2b3 GitHub organization, including model definition and
core utilities (CanViT-PyTorch), pretraining code (CanViT-pretrain), DINOv3/CanViT IN1k
and ADE20K probe fitting (dinov3-in1k-probes and CanViT-specialize), evaluation code
(CanViT-eval), and figure/data export code (CanViT-paper-exporter). We also release all the
checkpoints used in our evaluations, under the MIT license as well, alongside all data necessary to
regenerate figures and tables, at https://figshare.com/s/3f05748d12b01bdad5b3 and https:

H.2
Broader impact
CanViT’s constant-memory recurrent architecture, fast sequential inference and scalability to large
scenes make it an attractive candidate for future extension to real-time, high-FPS video processing,
embodied active perception, and high-resolution static image processing. In turn, such extensions
may support applications in a variety of domains, including edge/physical AI, medical imaging, and
camera- or satellite-based environmental monitoring.
As with nearly all general-purpose computer vision models, derivatives of this work might be
incorporated into surveillance and security technology. As such, we invite researchers building upon
active-vision foundation models to engage with the societal implications of any specific application.
H.3
Compute reporting
Over the course of this project, we used approximately 2500 H100-equivalent hours on our SLURM-
based compute platform. Our pretraining runs required under 24 GB of GPU memory (18.2 GB for
the 2M-step CanViT-B pretraining run described in Appendix C). For interactive development, probe
training, and downstream evaluations, we additionally used a single NVIDIA RTX 4090 workstation;
we did not have fine-grained usage tracking in place there, but estimate a total of around 2000 RTX
4090 GPU-hours.
ImageNet-1k fine-tuning experiments were run on Google Cloud TPU v6e-4 spot instances using
torch_xla. The total cost of these experiments was under 800 USD. The total runtime of our
reported IN1k fine-tuning run was under 15 wall-clock hours on TPUv6e-4 using SPMD data
parallelism. We did not perform extensive optimization of our torch_xla code.
The numbers above include all failed runs, preliminary experiments, and hyperparameter sweeps.
H.4
Statistical analysis
All confidence intervals reported in this paper are 95% bootstrap CIs. For the four stochastic viewing
policies (F-IID, R-IID, C2F, F2C), each evaluation run is one full pass over the evaluation set under
a fresh policy seed. We bootstrap the mean across runs (percentile method, 10,000 resamples;
scipy.stats.bootstrap). We plot these CIs as shaded bands (often too tight to be visible) in
Figure 4 and Figure 6. The other two policies (EG-C2F, RFS) are deterministic and yield single-run
point estimates. For Figure 5A,B, we bootstrap a LOWESS regression across ground-truth masks
(1,000 resamples; full methodology in Appendix D.5).
