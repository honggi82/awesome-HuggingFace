Currently OpenAI o1 sparks a surge of interest in the study of large reasoning models (LRM). Building on this momentum, Marco-o1 not only focuses on disciplines with standard answers, such as mathematics, physics, and coding—which are well-suited for reinforcement learning (RL)—but also places greater emphasis on open-ended resolutions. We aim to address the question: “Can the o1 model effectively generalize to broader domains where clear standards are absent and rewards are challenging to quantify?” Marco-o1 is powered by Chain-of-Thought (CoT) fine-tuning, Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), reflection mechanisms, and innovative reasoning strategies—optimized for complex real-world problem-solving tasks. The project homepage is: https://github.com/AIDC-AI/Marco-o1.

Work in Progress

We would like to emphasize that this research work is inspired by OpenAI’s o1 (from which the name is also derived). This work aims to explore potential approaches to shed light on the currently unclear technical roadmap for large reasoning models. Besides, our focus is on open-ended questions, and we have observed interesting phenomena in multilingual applications. However, we must acknowledge that the current model primarily exhibits o1-like reasoning characteristics and its performance still fall short of a fully realized "o1" model. This is not a one-time effort, and we remain committed to continuous optimization and ongoing improvement.

### 1. Introduction

OpenAI recently introduces the groundbreaking o1 model [OpenAI, 2024, Zhong et al., 2024], renowned for its exceptional reasoning capabilities. This model has demonstrates outstanding performance on platforms such as AIME and CodeForces, surpassing other leading models. Inspired by this success, we aim to push the boundaries of LLMs even further, enhancing their reasoning abilities to tackle complex, real-world challenges.

Inspired by OpenAI’s o1, we aim to explore potential approaches to shed light on the currently unclear technical roadmap for large reasoning models (LRM). Marco-o1 leverages advanced techniques like CoT fine-tuning [Wei et al., 2022], MCTS [Wei et al., 2022, Feng et al., 2023, Silver et al., 2017], and Reasoning Action Strategies to enhance its reasoning power. As shown in Figure 2, by finetuning Qwen2-7B-Instruct [Yang et al., 2024] with a combination of the filtered Open-O1 CoT dataset [OpenO1 Team, 2024], Marco-o1 CoT dataset, and Marco-o1 Instruction dataset, Marco-o1 improves its handling of complex tasks. MCTS allows exploration of multiple reasoning paths using confidence scores derived from softmax-applied log probabilities of the top-𝑘 alternative tokens, guiding the model to optimal solutions. Moreover, our reasoning action strategy involves varying the granularity of actions within steps and mini-steps to optimize search efficiency and accuracy.

Preliminary experiments demonstrates that our model can exhibit o1-like reasoning characteristics. Furthermore, Marco-o1 achieved accuracy improvements of +6.17% on the MGSM (English) dataset and +5.60% on the MGSM (Chinese) dataset, showcasing enhanced reasoning capabilities [Shi et al., 2022]. Additionally, in translation tasks, we demonstrate that Marco-o1 excels in translating slang expressions. For example, the model correctly translates a colloquial expression in Chinese that literally means “This shoe offers a stepping-on-poop sensation” to English “This shoe has a comfortable sole,” demonstrating its superior grasp of colloquial nuances. Currently, our main contributions are:

- • Fine-Tuning with CoT Data: We develop Marco-o1-CoT by performing full-parameter fine-tuning on the base model using open-source CoT datasets combined with our synthetic data.

- • Solution Space Expansion via MCTS: We integrate LLMs with MCTS (Marco-o1-MCTS), using the model’s output confidence to guide the search and expand the solution space.

- • Reasoning Action Strategy: We implement novel reasoning action strategies and a reflection mechanism (Marco-o1-MCTS mini-step), including exploring different action granularities within the MCTS framework and prompting the model to self-reflect, thereby significantly enhancing the model’s ability to solve complex problems.

- • Application in Translation Tasks: We are the first to investigate LRM on Machine Translation tasks, exploring inference-time scaling laws in the multilingual and translation domain.

### 2. Marco Reasoning Datasets

To enhance the reasoning capabilities of the Marco-o1 model, we employ a Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) strategy using a variety of datasets.

- • Open-O1 CoT Dataset (Filtered) [OpenO1 Team, 2024]: We refine the Open-O1 project’s CoT Dataset by applying heuristic and quality filtering processes. This enhancement allows the model to adopt structured reasoning patterns effectively.
- • Marco-o1 CoT Dataset (Synthetic): We generate the Marco-o1 CoT Dataset using MCTS, which helps to formulate complex reasoning pathways, bolstering the model’s reasoning capabilities.
- • Marco Instruction Dataset: Recognizing the critical role of robust instruction-following capabilities in executing complex tasks, we incorporate a set of instruction-following data. This integration

ensures the model remains competent across a wide range of tasks, maintaining its general effectiveness while significantly boosting its reasoning flair.

- 3. Solution Space Expansion via MCTS We integrate LLMs with MCTS to enhance the reasoning capabilities of our Marco-o1 model:

- • Nodes as Reasoning States: In the MCTS framework, each node represents a reasoning state of the problem-solving process.
- • Actions as LLM Outputs: The possible actions from a node are the outputs generated by the LLM. These outputs represent potential steps or mini-steps in the reasoning chain.
- • Rollout and Reward Calculation: During the rollout phase, the LLM continues the reasoning process to a terminal state.
- • Guiding MCTS: This reward score 𝑅 is used to evaluate and select promising paths within the

MCTS, effectively guiding the search towards more confident and reliable reasoning chains.

Furthermore, we obtain the value of each state by computing a confidence score. For each token 𝑡𝑖 generated during the rollout, we calculate its confidence score by applying the softmax function to its log probability and the log probabilities of the top 5 alternative tokens. This is given by:

exp(𝑝(𝑡𝑖))

𝑐𝑖 =

5 𝑘=1 exp(𝑝(𝑡𝑘))

where 𝑐𝑖 is the confidence score for the 𝑖𝑡ℎ token in the rollout. 𝑝(𝑡𝑖) is the log probability of the 𝑖𝑡ℎ token generated by the LLM. 𝑝(𝑡𝑘) for 𝑘 = 1 to 5 are the log probabilities of the top 5 predicted tokens at the 𝑖𝑡ℎ step. 𝑛 is the total number of tokens in the rollout sequence. This equation ensures that the confidence score reflects the relative probability of the chosen token compared to the top alternatives, effectively normalizing the scores between 0 and 1.

After obtaining the confidence scores for all tokens in the rollout sequence, we compute the average confidence score across all tokens to derive the overall reward score:

##### ∑︁𝑛

1

𝑣 =

𝑐𝑖

𝑛

𝑖=1

where 𝑣 is the overall reward score for the rollout path. This average serves as the reward signal that evaluates the quality of the reasoning path taken during the rollout. A higher 𝑣 indicates a more confident and likely accurate reasoning path.

By employing this method, we effectively expand the solution space, allowing the model to explore a vast array of reasoning paths and select the most probable ones based on calculated confidence scores.

### 4. Reasoning Action Strategy

#### 4.1. Action Selection

We observe that using actions as the granularity for MCTS search is relatively coarse, often causing the model to overlook nuanced reasoning paths crucial for solving complex problems. To address this, we explore different levels of granularity in the MCTS search. Initially, we use steps as the unit of search. To further expand the model’s search space and enhance its problem-solving capabilities, we experiment with dividing these steps into smaller units of 64 or 32 tokens, referred to as “mini-step.” This finer granularity allows the model to explore reasoning paths in greater detail. While token-level search offers theoretical maximum flexibility and granularity, it is currently impractical due to the significant computational resources required and the challenges associated with designing an effective reward model at this level.

In our experiments, we implement the following strategies within the MCTS framework:

- • Step as Action: We allow the model to generate complete reasoning steps as actions. Each MCTS node represents an entire thought or action label. This method enables efficient exploration but may miss finer-grained reasoning paths essential for complex problem-solving.
- • Mini-step as Action: We use mini-steps of 32 or 64 tokens as actions. This finer granularity expands the solution space and improves the model’s ability to navigate complex reasoning tasks

by considering more nuanced steps in the search process. By exploring the solution space at this level, the model is better equipped to find correct answers that might be overlooked with larger action units.

#### 4.2. Reflection after Thinking

We introduce a reflection mechanism by adding the phrase “Wait! Maybe I made some mistakes! I need to rethink from scratch.” at the end of each thought process. This prompts the model to self-reflect and reevaluate its reasoning steps. Implementing this reflection yields significant improvements, especially on difficult problems that the original model initially solves incorrectly. With the addition of reflection, approximately half of these challenging problems are answered correctly.

From the self-critic perspective [Valmeekam et al., 2023], this approach allows the model to act as its own critic, identifying potential errors in its reasoning. By explicitly prompting the model to question its initial conclusions, we encourage it to re-express and refine its thought process. This self-critical mechanism leverages the model’s capacity to detect inconsistencies or mistakes in its own output, leading to more accurate and reliable problem-solving [Madaan et al., 2024, Li et al., 2024, Huang et al., 2022]. The reflection step serves as an internal feedback loop, enhancing the model’s ability to self-correct without external intervention.

### 5. Experiments

#### 5.1. Setup

Based on Qwen2-7B-Instruct,∗ we perform SFT using our training data to create Marco-o1-CoT. Besides, we employ Marco-o1-CoT within the framework of MCTS tree search, differentiating by:

- • Marco-o1-MCTS (step): using each inference step as an action (step).
- • Marco-o1-MCTS (mini-step of 64 tokens): using a 64-token mini-step as an action (64 tokens).
- • Marco-o1-MCTS (mini-step of 32 tokens): using a 32-token mini-step as an action (32 tokens).

During testing, each model utilizes a CoT prompt to ensure consistency in reasoning processes. We then test these configurations on the English (En) and Chinese (Zh) subsets of the MGSM dataset.

#### 5.2. Main Results

In the MGSM-en dataset, Marco-o1-CoT shows an advantage over Qwen2-7B-Instruct, as shown in Figure 4, which is expected due to the fine-tuning with English CoT data. In the MGSM-zh dataset,

∗https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2-7B-Instruct

[Figure 4]

- Figure 3 | The main results of Marco-o1.

however, Marco-o1-CoT exhibits a decrease in performance compared to Qwen2-7B-Instruct. This decline is attributed to the fact that the CoT data used for fine-tuning was in English, which may not transfer effectively to the Chinese dataset.

As shwon in Table 2, The three MCTS-enhanced models demonstrate improvements over Marcoo1-CoT, indicating that incorporating MCTS helps to expand the model’s solution space and increase the probability of obtaining correct answers. However, since we use the Confidence Score as the reward, the tree search results exhibit significant randomness. In MGSM-en, the “step as Action” strategy performs the best, while in MGSM-zh, the “mini-step as Action (32)” strategy yields the highest accuracy. Currently, as shown in Figures 4, 5, and 6, we cannot draw definitive conclusions about which action strategy is superior. We believe that as the reward becomes more accurate, the larger solution space provided by MCTS will demonstrate greater potential.

Furthermore, we use Test@N to denote the percentage of problems solved correctly at least once when allowing the model to make N separate guesses for each problem.[Cobbe et al., 2021] As shwon in Table 3, we evaluated solve rates at Test@1, Test@8, and Test@32. The results demonstrate that MCTS shows an advantage with a lower number of separate guesses (Test@1). This reveals the potential of MCTS. In future work, we plan to train the reward model (RM) in conjunction with MCTS to continue optimizing our approach.

An interesting observation arises in Figure 1, where Marco-o1 tackles the classic ‘strawberry’ question: “How many ‘r’s are in ‘strawberry’.” While the model provides the correct answer, its reasoning omits explicitly addressing the final letter ‘y’. Upon reviewing the output, this omission does not appear to be a typo or intentional oversight. In the MCTS search paths, most routes also ignored the ‘y’, though some do include it. This suggests a possibility that the model might be confident enough in its reasoning to skip explicitly addressing the final step, akin to how humans sometimes omit obvious steps when solving problems.

These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of the model across different languages and configurations.

#### 5.3. Case Study on Translation Tasks

To demonstrate the capabilities of our Marco-o1 model in translation tasks, we conduct a case study comparing its performance with Google Translate on translating colloquial and slang expressions. Our

model excels in understanding context and nuances, providing more accurate and natural translations.

As shown in Figure 7, 8, and 9, these cases illustrate the advanced understanding and reasoning capabilities of Marco-o1 in handling complex translation tasks, especially with colloquial and slang language, outperforming standard translation tools like Google Translate.

### 6. Conclusions and Future Work

Our Marco-o1 enhances the reasoning ability by integrating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) fine-tuning, Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), and novel reasoning action strategies. Marco-o1’s integration of MCTS allows for expanded solution spaces, and experimentation with different action granularities (steps and mini-steps) shows the potential of finer search resolutions in enhancing accuracy. Our approach demonstrates significant improvements in reasoning tasks, as well as success in translating complex slang expressions.

Looking ahead, we aim to refine the reward signal for MCTS through Outcome Reward Modeling (ORM) and Process Reward Modeling (PRM) [Lightman et al., 2023], which will reduce randomness and further improve performance. Additionally, reinforcement learning techniques are being explored to fine-tune the decision-making processes of Marco-o1, ultimately enhancing its ability to tackle complex real-world tasks.
