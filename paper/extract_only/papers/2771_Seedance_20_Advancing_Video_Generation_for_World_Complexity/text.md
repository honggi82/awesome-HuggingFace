## Seedance 2.0: Advancing Video Generation for World Complexity

### ByteDance Seed 1 Introduction

Video generation models have become a core technology for modern digital content infrastructure and generative AI ecosystems, with rapid, widespread adoption across professional content production and consumer-facing creative scenarios. Through years of iterative research and engineering optimization, the ByteDance Seed team has built full-stack generative media technologies — including previous Seedance video generation series [6, 15, 16, 23], Seedream image generation and editing series [5, 7, 13, 17, 19, 20], Seed-VL multimodal vision-language models [3, 4, 9] for cross-modal semantic understanding, and other key components [21, 22], which are now widely integrated into our large-scale product ecosystem, supporting video generation services for billion-level daily active users.

In this work, we push the frontier of video generation technologies with a notable paradigm shift: from generating short video clips with limited controllability to robust, highly controllable video synthesis natively supporting diverse control signals. This industry-wide trend has driven the development of Seedance 2.0, our new model designed specifically to deliver enhanced generation quality with rich multi-modal controllability for large-scale creative engine platforms.

Seedance 2.0 is a new native multi-modal audio-video generation model, officially released in China in early February 2026. Compared with its predecessors, Seedance 1.0 and 1.5 Pro [6, 16], Seedance 2.0 adopts a unified, highly efficient, and large-scale architecture for multi-modal audio-video joint generation. This allows it to support four input modalities: text, image, audio, and video, by integrating one of the most comprehensive suites of multi-modal content reference and editing capabilities available in the industry to date. It delivers substantial, well-rounded improvements across all key sub-dimensions of video and audio generation. In both expert evaluations and public user tests, the model has demonstrated performance on par with the leading levels in the field.

Within its multi-modal framework, Seedance 2.0 is equipped with a full set of multi-modal reference and editing capabilities, supporting both standalone and combinatorial tasks, including subject control, motion manipulation, style transfer, special effects design and creative content generation, as well as video extension. This suite of capabilities renders the model applicable to a diverse array of creative production scenarios. The model achieves more accurate compliance with complex instructions and more stable motion performance, enabling it to accommodate more sophisticated production workflows. Coupled with its native, professional multi-shot narrative capability, vivid details of motion and facial expressions, and improved cross-frame consistency, the model reaches a competitive usability rate in real-world production settings.

Seedance 2.0 supports direct generation of audio-video content with durations ranging from 4 to 15 seconds, with native output resolutions of 480p and 720p. For multi-modal inputs as reference, its current open platform supports up to 3 video clips, 9 images, and 3 audio clips. In addition, we provide Seedance 2.0 Fast version, an accelerated variant of Seedance 2.0 designed to boost generation speed for low-latency scenarios. Seedance 2.0 has delivered significant improvements to its foundational generation capabilities and multi-modal generation performance, bringing an enhanced creative experience for end users. Its key model capabilities are highlighted as follows.

• Generation of Real-world Complexity. Seedance 2.0 achieves remarkable improvements in generation quality, particularly in human motion modeling, which delivers significantly enhanced naturalness, temporal coherence, and physical plausibility compared to previous versions. It can synthesize temporally precise,

complex interaction scenes with high fidelity, while adhering to real-world motion laws throughout the generation process, thereby mitigating the artifacts common in recent video generation models. For detailed close-up shots, the generated frames exhibit highly realistic details and rigorous consistency—whether for subtle changes in light refraction or natural, fluid interactions between characters and the environment—closely matching the visual fidelity of real-world live-action footage. With robust motion stability and physics compliance, the model delivers favorable performance in multi-subject interaction and complex motion scenarios, achieving a usability rate that is clearly higher than recent commercial models.

- • Strong multimodal capability. First, Seedance 2.0 accepts a comprehensive multimodal reference input, allowing you to combine text, image, video, and audio sources. The model can accurately interpret multimodal input content and generate output referencing user-specified elements that include frame composition, cinematographic design, motion rhythm, and acoustic characteristics in accordance with user instructions. It can also directly reference text-based storyboards, enhancing the flexibility of conventional video generation workflows and expanding the creative freedom. Second, Seedance 2.0 features substantially improved controllability in video generation. It delivers strong instruction-following performance, accurately generating specified content, and maintaining consistent subject identity preservation even when processing complex scripts with extensive character interactions and fine-grained action descriptions. Meanwhile, the model exhibits fundamental directorial and cinematographic reasoning capabilities, enabling it to autonomously plan shot sequencing and design visual presentation templates. In addition, Seedance 2.0 introduces new video editing capabilities, which enable targeted modifications to specified clips, characters, actions, or plot elements. It also provides video continuation functionality, which generates consecutive shots aligned with user prompts, supporting both de novo video generation and seamless extension of existing footage.
- • High-Fidelity Audio-Video Generation. Seedance 2.0 has binaural audio capability with synchronized highfidelity immersive sound generation. It is equipped with an upgraded audio generation module integrated with binaural audio technology, which enables high-fidelity, immersive sound generation. The model supports simultaneous multi-track output of audio content including background audio, ambient sound effects, and character narration, with precise temporal alignment to the visual rhythm of generated footage. The audio content generated by the model features highly natural sound design, faithfully reproducing subtle natural ambient sounds to enhance scene immersion. Coupled with strict audio-visual temporal control, the model ensures tight synchronization between audio tracks and visual actions, providing robust support for professional-grade audio-visual content creation.
- • Applications in Productivity Scenarios. It exhibits strong cross-scene adaptability, which reduces the barriers to professional content production. In response to the diverse demands of video content production, Seedance 2.0 demonstrates high cross-scene adaptability. It delivers high-quality generation results across a wide range of use cases, including commercial advertising, cinematic and television visual effects, game animation, and commentary videos. By replacing complex visual effects production and live-action shooting workflows with AI generation, Seedance 2.0 can significantly reduce production costs and shorten the production cycle of professional audio-video content, helping creators and enterprises realize their creative concepts.

From the audio-video synchronous generation achieved by Seedance 1.5 [16] to the unified multimodal audiovideo joint generation framework established by Seedance 2.0, the Seedance series has consistently been built around a unified architecture, with a core commitment to high-fidelity reconstruction of real-world complexity.

We acknowledge that Seedance 2.0 remains imperfect, with room for improvement in its generation outputs. Moving forward, we will continue to explore deep alignment between generative models and the physical world, advance accurate modeling of real-world dynamics, deepen our understanding of physical and semantic rules, and enable the technology to better serve every creator.

Safety is a core consideration in our work. Throughout the model iteration lifecycle, we have implemented a structured safety assessment framework and made continuous efforts to evaluate and mitigate potential risks, with the aim of supporting responsible, compliant, and ethically aligned development.

We invite readers to explore the capabilities of Seedance 2.0. Seedance 2.0 is now accessible on Doubao1, Jimeng2 and Volcano Engine, under the model id: doubao-seedance-2-0-260128. The model can be accessed at https://www.volcengine.com/experience/ark?mode=vision& modelId=doubao-seedance-2-0-260128&tab=GenVideo.

### 2 Evaluation

#### 2.1 Overview

To objectively and comprehensively assess the overall capabilities of Seedance 2.0 in multi-modal scenarios, our team collaborated with experts from the media industry to establish a comprehensive evaluation benchmark and corresponding evaluation protocols. The benchmark covers audio-video generation, reference-based generation, and video editing scenarios. This evaluation focuses on the model’s performance across core dimensions: multi-modal reference-based generation, complex audio-video instruction following, complex motion stability, professional cinematographic language expression, audio and video expressiveness, and audio-visual integrated alignment. As shown in Figure 1, Seedance 2.0 achieves the highest scores across all evaluated dimensions in Text-to-Video (T2V), Image-to-Video (I2V), and Reference-to-Video (R2V) tasks, demonstrating comprehensive leading performance over current competing models.

Text-to-Video and Image-to-Video Evaluation. In video generation tasks, Seedance 2.0 delivers competitive leading performance in the industry. Marked improvements have been achieved in motion stability, instruction following capability, and visual aesthetics. The model effectively mitigates common structural inaccuracies and visual artifacts, generating smooth and nuanced complex motions. It can accurately render high-tension large-scale movements and subtle micro-expressions, while supporting professional-level combined camera movements and narrative rhythm control. For long scripts and open-ended instructions, the model can respond appropriately and deliver reasonable generation outputs. Meanwhile, the generated videos exhibit notable cinematic aesthetics, with well-rendered object textures, lighting and composition, as well as costume, makeup and prop design. In the audio domain, Seedance 2.0 maintains strong performance with substantial improvements in audio expressiveness. Its dual-channel audio output presents rich and nuanced layers, and can generate sound effects or melodies that align well with the context described in the prompts. Compared with the previous version, the model delivers an enhanced audio-visual integrated experience, with tighter alignment between dialogue lines, sound effects, background audio, and visual content. Meanwhile, the

- 2https://jimeng.jianying.com/ai-tool/video/generate

instruction following accuracy for Chinese dialects, traditional opera, and singing scenarios is significantly improved.

Multi-modal Reference-Based Generation Evaluation. Seedance 2.0 achieves competitive leading comprehensive performance in reference-based generation tasks. The model supports a more comprehensive range of referencebased tasks, covering multiple creative scenarios including multi-modal reference-based generation, video editing, and video continuation. Meanwhile, it demonstrates advantages in the depth of understanding and response accuracy for reference content. Specifically, in video editing tasks, Seedance 2.0 delivers more complete instruction following and more photorealistic visual outputs compared with peer models. In terms of generation consistency, the model achieves favorable performance in subject appearance and voice restoration, with particularly notable advantages in maintaining reference consistency for action logic, special effect styles, and plot narrative. Despite these strengths, there is still room for optimization in multi-subject consistency, text restoration accuracy, and the performance of complex editing tasks.

We evaluate Seedance 2.0 on three generation tasks—T2V (Text-to-Video), I2V (Image-to-Video), and R2V (Reference-to-Video)—against current commercial video generation models. Seedance 2.0 ranks first across all video and audio dimensions on every task.

On video, the main advances are: (1) Stability—fewer deformations and structural issues; complex actions are fluid; multilingual text generation and preservation are relatively strong. (2) Vividness—sports, combat, and other high-amplitude actions carry strong momentum; facial expressions and gaze are emotionally engaging; the model produces professional-level camera movements, dynamic editing, and narrative pacing. (3) Instruction following—long-script prompts are executed with reasonable precision, multi-shot and multi-angle instructions are followed accurately, and open-ended prompts receive appropriate creative interpretation; multiple art styles are supported; in I2V, special art styles from the reference image are preserved while adapting subject motion to match. (4) Visual realism—object materials look authentic, lighting, composition, and character texture improve notably, and costume and prop design is polished.

On audio: (1) Expressiveness—audio is detailed and layered, with dual-channel support; melodies and tones match the prompt context, and the audio dimension adds to the emotional impact of the video. (2) Audio-visual sync—lip movements match the visual, dialogue, sound effects, and background audio align well, and beat-matching between audio and video is strong. (3) Audio instruction following—Chinese dialects (Sichuan, Northeastern, Cantonese), opera, and singing improve markedly over the previous version; singing, rap, and instrumental performance are consistent, with melodies adapted to the prompt context.

Areas for improvement remain: minor deformation artifacts, motion plausibility in edge cases, high-frequency visual noise, audio distortion and noise, and lip-sync errors in multi-speaker scenes. The following subsections present detailed results for each task.

#### 2.2 Evaluation Framework

To prepare the model for production deployment, we upgraded our evaluation framework to SeedVideoBench 2.0. The new version adds multimodal generation, narrative quality, and multilingual coverage to the evaluation scope, and refines how audio expressiveness is assessed. We also brought in expert evaluators from advertising and game production to provide subjective ratings, with a focus on narrative and aesthetic quality.

##### 2.2.1 SeedVideoBench 2.0

Two main changes define the new framework. First, a multimodal task evaluation system that formally defines multimodal task following and generation consistency, while also covering baseline generation quality (prompt following, motion quality) in multimodal settings. Second, we split evaluation into objective and subjective tracks. Objective metrics like motion stability—use automated pipelines. Subjective metrics like aesthetics—go through blind expert review. Separately, we ran a realism study: evaluators tried to tell Seedance 2.0 outputs apart from real video clips. The results fed back into our aesthetic tuning process.

The multimodal task evaluation module and the narrative assessment module saw the largest changes from the previous version. Multimodal Task Following measures instruction-following accuracy across reference, editing,

and extension scenarios, broken into dozens of fine-grained task types (subject identity, motion, style, etc.). Most models have limited multimodal coverage, which forces users to probe capability boundaries through trial and error; these metrics make the boundaries explicit. Specifically, the evaluation covers four task groups:

- • Reference tasks: subject, motion, visual-effects, and style reference generation.
- • Editing tasks: subject, style, scene, and audio content editing.
- • Extension tasks: plot continuation and seamless extension, both forward and backward on the timeline.
- • Combination tasks: paired evaluations that match real workflows—e.g., swapping a video subject with a reference image (reference + editing combined).

Consistency captures how closely generated content matches the reference input (reference alignment) and how well non-edited regions survive during editing (editing consistency). We built specialized datasets covering subject, motion, scene, style, and audio, with sample distributions tuned to minimize variance at small evaluation budgets.

On the video metrics side, SeedVideoBench 1.5 already tracked vividness; version 2.0 adds finer narrative quality metrics alongside the existing vividness and aesthetics dimensions. Unlike motion quality, which can be measured more objectively, narrative quality is inherently subjective—it asks whether the overall narrative reads as coherent, whether character performances and visual effects carry emotional weight, and whether the aesthetic choices fit the content. We evaluate it along three sub-dimensions:

- • Cinematographic language: does the camerawork support the story? We assess shot logic and expressiveness, looking for problems like redundant coverage, axis-crossing (180-degree rule violations), mismatched shot sizes, and uneven pacing.
- • Plot design: can the model take a vague or brief prompt and produce something both coherent and engaging?
- • Stylistic aesthetics: do the visuals have a considered look? This covers lighting, framing, composition, and color grading, plus whether characters, costumes, props, and sets hold together aesthetically.

Unless otherwise noted, all evaluation results reported in the following sections are obtained using SeedVideoBench 2.0.

Figure 2 Leaderboards on Arena.AI (Accessed: April 8, 2026, Eastern Time).

Arena (formerly LMArena) [2], created by researchers from UC Berkeley, is a community-powered platform that evaluates AI models through real-world user preferences. For video generation, users are presented with outputs from two anonymous models side-by-side and vote for the one they prefer, producing an Elo-style leaderboard that reflects genuine human judgment at scale. Unlike automated benchmarks that rely on metrics such as FVD or CLIPScore, Arena captures holistic human preferences encompassing visual quality, motion realism, temporal coherence, and prompt adherence in a single unified ranking.

As shown in Figure 2, our Dreamina Seedance 2.0 720p ranks #1 on both the Text-to-Video and Image-toVideo leaderboards, with Elo scores of 1450 (±15) and 1449 (±11) respectively. On T2V (Figure 2a), it leads the second-place veo-3.1-audio-1080p by 79 points; on I2V (Figure 2b), it leads grok-imagine-video-720p by 29 points. Notably, the model achieves this at 720p resolution, outperforming competitors that operate at 1080p, which suggests that our improvements in motion dynamics and visual coherence are more perceptually significant than resolution alone. The Rank Spread of 1↔1 on both leaderboards indicates consistently top-ranked performance across evaluation dimensions. These results complement our SeedVideoBench2.0 findings, demonstrating that the gains observed in objective metrics translate directly into stronger human preference.

Table 1 summarizes the T2V results. Seedance 2.0 ranks first on all six dimensions, the only model above

- 3.4 on every dimension and improving over Seedance 1.5 [16] by an average of 0.86 points, with the largest gain on motion quality (+1.36). On both motion quality and audio-visual sync, Seedance 2.0 reaches 3.75, at least 0.65 points ahead of the runner-up. The audio dimensions are where competitors struggle most—most stay below 2.9—while Seedance 2.0 exceeds 3.5 on all three. Among competitors, Kling 3.0 [12] is the most balanced overall, Sora 2 Pro [14] stands out on prompt following, and Veo 3.1 [8] is weaker on audio.

The usability breakdown in Table 2 sharpens this picture. Seedance 2.0 is the only model with usability above 83% on all dimensions, reaching 97.55% on motion quality. More tellingly, Seedance 2.0 exceeds 51% satisfaction on every dimension—the majority of its outputs score 4 or above—while no competitor exceeds 44% on any single dimension. The gap is most pronounced on audio: audio quality satisfaction is 62.05% vs. below 10% for all competitors, and audio-visual sync reaches 68.30% vs. a competitor high of 25.45%. At the delight level (score of 5), only Seedance 2.0 produces any delight-rated audio quality outputs (6.70%), and its audio prompt following delight rate of 26.92% far exceeds the next-best Sora 2 Pro (11.68%).

Seedance 2.0 leads on motion stability, editing rhythm, and multi-entity interaction, with far fewer cases of subject deformation and physically implausible motion than Seedance 1.5. Kling 3.0 ranks second but is limited on high-difficulty actions and complex camera work. Veo 3.1 and Sora 2 Pro handle basic motion reasonably well, yet fall short on fine-grained dynamics and long-take stability. The fine-grained breakdown in Table 3 confirms this: Seedance 2.0 ranks first on 29 of 30 categories (tying with Kling 3.0 only on group coordinated motion), scoring 3.29–4.43.

- (2.00), and intense sports motion (2.00); Seedance 2.0 improves by over 1.5 points on each. Kling 3.0 does well on emotion & expression (3.64), abstract challenges (3.57), and multi-entity feature match (3.43), but drops on intense sports motion (2.86), surreal motion (2.86), and special camera shots (3.08). Sora 2 Pro scores lowest on surreal motion (2.00) and intense sports motion (2.21); Veo 3.1 is weakest on multi-entity feature match (2.50) and group coordinated motion (2.33).

##### 2.3.3 Video Prompt Following

Compared to Seedance 1.5, version 2.0 improves on text rendering, physical phenomena, intent comprehension, and style following, with more precise action following and reasonable creative interpretation beyond the core instructions. Kling 3.0 carries over strengths from Kling 2.6 on emotional expression and physical feedback, but stays weak on text following. Veo 3.1’s main shortcoming is poor text generation and instruction response. Sora 2 Pro handles most categories well with strong creative interpretation, leading on abstract challenges, but scores lowest on surreal motion, placing it in the second tier.

Lip synchronization and action-audio alignment are both strong for Seedance 2.0, with very few cases of delay or misalignment. Competitors commonly produce lip-speech mismatches and action-sound offsets, worse in fast dialogue and complex action scenes. In Table 7, Seedance 2.0 ranks first on 16 of 17 categories (tying with

- Seedance 1.5 on off-screen voice at 2.86), scoring 2.86–4.17. English (4.17), singing/rap (4.14), dual-channel audio (4.00), and non-verbal voice (4.00) are strongest. The largest gains over Seedance 1.5 are Chinese multi-person dialogue (2.36 → 3.86), object interaction sound (2.65 → 3.82), and animal sound (2.79 → 3.93). No competitor reaches 3.5 on any category apart from Sora 2 Pro on singing/rap (3.50) and Seedance 1.5 on English (3.50). Veo 3.1 is weakest, dropping to 1.67 on spatial scene and 2.10 on Chinese multi-person dialogue. Kling 3.0 regresses from Kling 2.6 on singing/rap (2.57 vs. 3.00) and instruments & audio (2.79 vs.

- 3.00), while improving on Chinese dialect (3.14 vs. 2.68).

- 2.3.7 Audio Prompt Following

- Table 9 summarizes the I2V results. Seedance 2.0 ranks first on all six dimensions, scoring 3.31–3.70, while no competitor exceeds 3.18. The three video dimensions show 3.35 (motion quality), 3.46 (video prompt following), and 3.31 (image preservation). Source image preservation is the tightest race—Kling 3.0 trails by only 0.13—while motion quality shows a 0.55-point gap to the runner-up. The three audio dimensions are where competitors fall furthest behind: Seedance 2.0 scores 3.61, 3.54, and 3.70, while Kling 2.6 (2.21) and Wan 2.6 [1] (2.18–2.55) sit well below 3.0. Seedance 1.5 Pro is second on audio (3.07, 2.95, 3.10) but still trails by 0.54–0.60. Audio prompt following (3.70) is Seedance 2.0’s highest I2V score. A two-tier pattern is clear: Seedance 2.0 leads on both video and audio, while competitors are weaker on audio than on video.
- Table 10 breaks this down further. Seedance 2.0 is the only model with usability above 87% on all six dimensions. On motion quality, its 43.88% satisfaction rate is over 3× the runner-up Kling 3.0 (12.00%); on video prompt following, 47.48% vs. Veo 3.1’s 20.54%.

usability vs. Kling 3.0’s 90.55%, though the satisfaction gap is wider (38.85% vs. 27.27%). The audio contrast is sharper. On audio quality, Seedance 2.0 reaches 97.42% usability and 57.08% satisfaction; Kling 2.6 and Wan 2.6 have usability below 28%, meaning most of their audio is rated unacceptable. On audio prompt following, Seedance 2.0’s 63.52% satisfaction is 1.7× Seedance 1.5 Pro’s 37.77% and over 10× Kling 2.6’s

- 5.70%.

Beyond the scores, human evaluation of generated videos surfaces additional patterns. Seedance 2.0 produces dynamic motion with a clear sense of momentum—combat and dance sequences mix slow-motion highlights with fast action in ways competitors do not, and facial expressions and gaze are more vivid than Seedance 1.5 Pro. Camera work tracks subject motion closely with varied angles and smooth push/pull transitions. Firstand third-person game-following perspectives with handheld breathing effects are new to this version and add immersion. The model handles special art styles (felt, oil painting, Chinese gongbi) without breaking visual coherence, matching subject motion to the referenced style. Realistic and 3D visual effects render fluidly. On the audio side, dialogue voices carry emotional nuance in both Chinese and non-Chinese languages. Voice, sound effects, and audio are well-layered—outputs sound like composed audio rather than isolated tracks stacked together. Common Chinese dialects (Sichuan, Northeastern, Cantonese) come through accurately. Singing, rap, and instrumental audio across languages are strong, with melodies that fit the prompt context.

Prompt Abstraction. This category tests UGC-style creative prompts and script-controlled generation.

- Seedance 2.0 leads on all three metrics for script-controlled (15s) generation and on MQ and IP for UGC creative/portrait (Table 11). The gap is largest on script-controlled (15s) generation: VPF 3.87 vs. Kling
- 3.0’s 3.00 and Wan 2.6’s 2.50. Veo 3.1 scores 3.87 on VPF for UGC creative/portrait—the best in that sub-category—but its MQ (2.53) and IP (2.87) are much lower. Kling 2.6 falls below 2.5 on MQ for both sub-categories, and Wan 2.6 drops to 2.14 on script-controlled MQ. Open-ended and script-based prompts remain difficult for most models; only Seedance 2.0 and Kling 3.0 consistently exceed 3.0 on MQ.

Complex Instructions. Compound multi-instruction is where Seedance 2.0 pulls furthest ahead: MQ 4.00 and VPF 3.75, outscoring Kling 3.0 by over 1.0 point on MQ (Table 12). Seedance 1.5 Pro scored 2.13/2.25 on MQ/VPF for this sub-category, so complex instruction handling improved by nearly 2 points in the 2.0 generation. Veo 3.1 reaches 3.38 on VPF for new entity tasks—close to Seedance 2.0’s 3.88—but its MQ (2.50) lags, meaning it follows the instruction but produces weaker motion. Degree adverbs is the tightest sub-category: Seedance 2.0 scores 3.20/3.40/3.40 with Seedance 1.5 Pro not far behind at 2.80/3.00/3.07.

Complex Camera. Seedance 2.0 leads on MQ for all three camera sub-categories and on VPF for combined shot instructions and advanced camera movement (Table 13). On difficult shots & special techniques, it scores 3.88 on IP—the highest single value in this table—while Kling 3.0 reaches 3.25. Kling 2.6 scores 3.38 on VPF for difficult shots—the best in that sub-category—handling special techniques better than general camera work. Advanced camera movement is the hardest sub-category: Seedance 2.0 and Kling 3.0 tie on MQ (2.71), and no model exceeds 3.14 on any metric. Camera flexibility is an area where all models have room to improve; advanced movement scores stay below 3.2 across the board.

Complex Motion. Seedance 2.0’s strongest results here are sports (MQ 3.73, VPF 3.93) and micro-expression & emotion (VPF 4.00), as shown in Table 14. Combat visual effects shows the widest gap: Seedance 2.0 scores MQ 3.63 vs. Kling 3.0’s 2.25 and Seedance 1.5 Pro’s 2.25—a 1.38-point difference. Expression and gaze vividness improved substantially over Seedance 1.5 Pro (micro-expression MQ: 2.88 → 3.63). Kling 3.0

- Seedance 2.0 leads all evaluated models on R2V, outperforming Kling 3 Omni [12], Kling O1 [11], and Vidu Q2 Pro [18] across every dimension. It supports more multi-modal task types with higher accuracy—beyond subject, style, motion reference, and video editing supported by competitors, Seedance 2.0 also handles creative and visual-effects reference, video continuation and extension, and combined tasks such as motion reference + subject reference, with fewer issues of missing or confused input materials. Reference alignment is best across subject appearance and voice, motion, and style, with clear advantages in subject identity and style preservation. Motion quality—vividness, physical plausibility, and structural stability—is uniformly stronger, with stability as the largest lead. Prompt following is also strongest, particularly on long-text and complex narratives, visual effects, dialogue, text rendering, and open-ended instructions. Table 24 quantifies this: Seedance 2.0 ranks first on all five dimensions, scoring 2.50 and 2.52 on multimodal task following and prompt following (1–3 scale), and 3.54, 3.03, 3.24 on editing consistency, reference alignment, and motion quality (1–5 scale). The gaps are smallest on editing consistency (Kling 3.0 trails by 0.17) and largest on motion quality (0.86–0.94 behind across all competitors) and reference alignment (0.66–1.24 behind). Vidu Q2 Pro scores lowest on three of five dimensions. Kling 3.0 and Kling O1 trade second and third depending on the dimension, but neither approaches Seedance 2.0 on motion quality or prompt following.

- Table 25 compares multi-modal task support. Seedance 2.0 supports 20 of 22 input modalities—the broadest of any model. The two unsupported tasks (subject audio-visual + audio reference, video audio editing) are unsupported by every model. Three task groups are exclusive to Seedance 2.0: all three visual effects / creative reference variants and all four continuation / extension variants, totaling 7 tasks no competitor can handle. Kling 3 Omni supports 9 of 22, lacking style reference, visual effects / creative reference, and continuation / extension. Vidu Q2 Pro supports 13 of 22, covering style reference but missing visual effects / creative reference and continuation / extension. Kling O1 is the most limited at 10 of 22, additionally lacking video-based subject reference and audio-visual inputs.

Seedance 2.0 achieves the best overall subject reference quality in both appearance and voice across all multi-modal competitors, with a clear lead in appearance consistency. As shown in Table 26, on image-based subject reference, Seedance 2.0 scores 2.80 on task following (1–3 scale) with 100% 2-point rate and 80% 3-point rate, ahead of Kling O1 (2.71, 73.68%), Vidu Q2 Pro (2.58, 69.70%), and Kling 3 Omni (2.50, 50%). The reference alignment gap is wider: Seedance 2.0 scores 3.18 vs. Kling O1 at 2.71 and Vidu Q2 Pro at

- 1.91, a 1.27-point deficit for the latter. On video-based subject reference, Seedance 2.0 scores 2.95 on task following with 95% of outputs reaching 3 points, and 3.35 on reference alignment—Vidu Q2 Pro trails at 2.00, a 1.35-point gap. For first-video reference, Sora 2 leads on task following (3.00, with 100% 3-point rate), while Seedance 2.0 (2.89) and Kling 3 Omni (2.91) are close behind; on reference alignment, Seedance 2.0 and Sora

Seedance 2.0 produces the best reference alignment for body motion, visual effects, and creative sequences, while competitors frequently fail to reproduce referenced effects or capture complete body movements. Table 27 shows Seedance 2.0 scoring 2.60 on motion reference task following, ahead of Kling 3 Omni (2.20), Kling O1 (2.19), and Vidu Q2 Pro (1.92). On reference alignment, the gap widens: Seedance 2.0 scores 2.64, while all competitors fall below 2.0—Vidu Q2 Pro scores only 1.14, meaning most outputs bear little resemblance to the reference motion. One exception: on first-frame preservation, Kling 3 Omni scores 4.31, well above Seedance 2.0’s 2.71. Kling 3 Omni tends to keep the first frame nearly unchanged but produces weaker subsequent motion, while Seedance 2.0 generates more dynamic video at the cost of lower first-frame fidelity. On style reference, Seedance 2.0 leads with 2.57 on task following (60% 3-point rate) vs. Vidu Q2 Pro (2.15, 33.33%) and Kling O1 (1.96, 10.71%). Kling 3 Omni does not support style reference at all. Reference alignment follows the same order: 2.37, 1.85, 1.84. When combining style and subject reference, Seedance 2.0 produces more accurate responses and better generation quality; competitors frequently misinterpret the task as reference-image editing or produce artifacts, with Kling 3 Omni exhibiting this issue most often.

Video editing is the most competitive R2V task. In Table 28, Kling O1 slightly leads on task following (2.29 vs. Seedance 2.0’s 2.20), and Kling 3 Omni is close at 2.24—all three within 0.09 points. However, Seedance

- 2.0 pulls ahead on reference alignment (3.79 vs. Kling O1’s 3.03) and editing consistency (3.75 vs. Kling 3 Omni’s 3.09). Seedance 2.0 responds better to long-text and multi-edit instructions and handles complex editing tasks more completely, while also producing more accurate results for well-known IP references. All models share common failure modes: unresponsive edits and unintended modifications to non-edit regions.

Video continuation is currently supported only by Seedance 2.0, which scores 2.88 on task following and 3.18 on reference alignment. It handles complex narratives and long-text continuation prompts well, though issues remain with color consistency, multi-subject omission, and subject duplication.

For video extension, Seedance 2.0 and Veo 3.1 are the only two models evaluated, but they differ in scope:

Seedance 2.0 accepts arbitrary uploaded videos for extension and supports combining extension with subject image input, while Veo 3.1 can only extend videos it generated itself. Despite broader input support, Seedance 2.0’s extension quality trails Veo 3.1 notably—Veo 3.1 scores 2.78 on task following (88.89% 3-point rate) vs. Seedance 2.0’s 1.93 (31.82%), and 3.44 vs. 3.28 on reference alignment, making extension Seedance 2.0’s weakest R2V task.

#### 2.6 Visualization Results

Leveraging significant advancements in foundational capabilities and Multimodal Task Performance, Seedance 2.0 will deliver an entirely new creative experience for users. It is capable of synthesizing temporally precise and complex interactive scenes with high fidelity. As shown in the first and second row of Figure 4, the generation process maintains exceptional motion quality by strictly adhering to real-world physical laws of motion, avoiding physical anomalies commonly observed in earlier AI-generated videos. For example, in the skating scenario, the model effectively renders a series of highly demanding maneuvers—such as synchronized take-offs, mid-air rotations, and precise landings. In response to the diversified demands of video content production, Seedance 2.0 demonstrates exceptional scenario adaptability in the third row of Figure 4. Whether applied to commercial advertising, television visual effects, video game animation, or explainer videos, the model consistently delivers high-quality generation results and robust multimodal task performance. By replacing complex visual effects pipelines and live-action workflows with AI-driven generation, Seedance 2.0 significantly reduces the production costs of professional audio and video content, shortens production cycles, and empowers both creators and enterprises to more effectively realize their creative visions.

The figure in the painting looks guilty — eyes darting left and right, then peeks out beyond the picture frame. Quickly reaches a hand out of the frame, picks up a cola, takes a sip, and breaks into a deeply satisfied expression. Just then, the sound of footsteps approaches. The figure hurriedly puts the cola back in its place. At that moment, a Western cowboy walks up, picks up the cola from the glass, and walks away with it. The closing shot pushes in to a top-lit close-up of the cola against a pure black background. At the bottom of the frame, stylized artistic subtitles appear alongside a voiceover: "宜⼝可乐，不可不尝！"
