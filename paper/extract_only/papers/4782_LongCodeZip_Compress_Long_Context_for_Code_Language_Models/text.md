Abstract—Code generation under long contexts is becoming increasingly critical as Large Language Models (LLMs) are required to reason over extensive information in the codebase. While recent advances enable code LLMs to process long inputs, high API costs and generation latency remain substantial bottlenecks. Existing context pruning techniques, such as LLMLingua, achieve promising results for general text but overlook code-specific structures and dependencies, leading to suboptimal performance in programming tasks. In this paper, we propose LongCodeZip, a novel plug-and-play code compression framework designed specifically for code LLMs. LongCodeZip employs a dual-stage strategy: (1) coarse-grained compression, which identifies and ranks function-level chunks using conditional perplexity with respect to the instruction, retaining only the most relevant functions; and (2) fine-grained compression, which segments retained functions into blocks based on perplexity and selects an optimal subset under an adaptive token budget to maximize relevance. Evaluations across multiple tasks, including code completion, summarization, and question answering, show that LongCodeZip consistently outperforms baseline methods, achieving up to a 5.6× compression ratio without degrading task performance. By effectively reducing context size while preserving essential information, LongCodeZip enables LLMs to better scale to real-world, large-scale code scenarios, advancing the efficiency and capability of code intelligence applications1.

I. INTRODUCTION

LLMs specialized for code have revolutionized software development by demonstrating remarkable capabilities in code completion [1], [2], translation [3], [4], program synthesis [5], [6], [7] and program repair [8], [9]. Models like DeepSeekCoder [10], Qwen2.5-Coder [11], Seed-Coder [12] can reason over diverse programming languages and significantly enhance productivity. As code LLMs are increasingly deployed for real-world tasks like repository-level question answering [13] and long-context code completion [1], there is a growing demand for handling contexts that span tens of thousands of tokens. This need has motivated efforts to extend LLM context windows [14], [11], [15]. However, effective handling of long code contexts remains a central bottleneck. Three major challenges arise in such long code context scenarios. First, as the input context grows, the quadratic complexity of the transformer attention mechanism [16] leads to decreased

generation efficiency. At the same time, processing longer inputs with LLMs results in rapidly increasing API costs, especially when pricing models are expensive [17], [18]. Second, LLMs struggle to identify and utilize relevant content amid lengthy inputs [19], [20]. Third, even though recent LLMs support extended context windows to 128k tokens, these limits can still be reached when processing large files and long conversation histories, leading to context truncation and degraded outputs [21].

These issues are particularly pronounced in code LLMs. Unlike natural language text, source code is highly structured with complex dependencies spanning across functions, classes, and files. Dependencies between variable declarations, function definitions, and their uses often extend beyond what current context windows can accommodate. As a result, LLMs frequently produce code that fails to compile, violates existing patterns, or ignores critical constraints when the relevant context exceeds their window size [22]. Consequently, context compression has emerged as a key demand for enabling longcontext code understanding.

Existing approaches to address long context limitations have notable shortcomings when applied to code. General text compression methods like LLMLingua [23] and Selective Context [24] fail to account for code-specific characteristics and often break code structure. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) [25] reduce context length by selecting relevant code snippets from the repository context, but it merely rely on text similarities, and may overlook implicit dependencies within the context. Traditional code compressors such as DietCode [26] and SlimCode [27] improve syntax and structure awareness but are generally limited to function-level pruning or short code examples, leaving compression of long context for code largely unaddressed.

To overcome these limitations, we introduce LongCodeZip, a training-free, model-agnostic, and plug-and-play context compression framework for code LLMs. Our approach leverages the inherent structure of code through a novel twostage compression strategy that preserves code semantics while significantly reducing token consumption. First, we perform coarse-grained compression by identifying and ranking function-level chunks based on their relevance to the instruction. Then, within the selected functions, it applies perplexitybased block detection followed by fine-grained block-level

retrieves and appends relevant code snippets to the prompt, leveraging embedding models such as UniXcoder [30] or CodeBERT [31], and similarity measures such as cosine similarity. While RAG effectively reduces context length, it primarily relies on surface-level lexical similarity between snippets. Consequently, it often fails to capture code segments with deeper semantic or functional dependencies—particularly when such relationships are implicit, abstracted, or span multiple components.

compression to maximize relevance under an adaptive token budget. To the best of our knowledge, LongCodeZip is the first framework specifically designed for long-context code compression and to introduce perplexity-based block detection, providing an efficient and general-purpose solution that preserves task-critical content within strict token limitations.

We evaluate LongCodeZip across multiple code benchmarks with long contexts, including Long Code Completion [1], Long Module Summarization [21], and RepoQA [13]. Results demonstrate that our approach achieves up to a 5.6× compression ratio without sacrificing performance, generalizes well across tasks and models (even with only 0.5B model as the compressor), and significantly reduces generation time and token costs.

Consider the examples in Figure 1. In the first scenario, the task is to complete an get_email_by_id function. Retrieving Account class and the get_account_by_id function proves effective, as they share similar function and parameter names. In this case, RAG works well due to strong lexical and structural overlap. In the second scenario, however, the task is to implement a train_model function that relies on configuration values defined in a separate Config class. Here, crucial context like Config is often missed, since RAG may not identify these implicit or non-lexical dependencies. This omission can lead to incomplete or incorrect code generation.

Our main contributions include:

- 1) A novel long-context, code-specific hierarchical compression approach that performs function-level chunking and selection, followed by perplexity-based block detection and block-level pruning.
- 2) An adaptive budget allocation and 0/1 knapsack selection mechanism that prioritizes relevant blocks and maximizes critical detail within the token budget.
- 3) A comprehensive evaluation demonstrating that LongCodeZip outperforms baselines on code completion, summarization, and question answering tasks, achieving up to a 5.6× compression ratio without sacrificing performance.

This example highlights the need for context selection criteria that extend beyond surface-level similarity. In both scenarios, an effective similarity measure should assign high relevance to get_account_by_id in the first case and, critically, to Config in the second—even when there is minimal lexical overlap between the configuration class and the training function.

II. MOTIVATION

III. METHODOLOGY A. Problem Formulation

Code generation under long context is becoming increasingly important in LLM-based software development. Such tasks often require referencing numerous related files across an entire project repository, resulting in input contexts that span tens of thousands of tokens. However, these long contexts typically contain scattered and redundant information, which can distract the model and degrade output quality. Moreover, the substantial computational cost of processing such large inputs further exacerbates latency and resource constraints, creating a significant bottleneck for practical deployment.

Given a long code context c = {c1,...,cn} with n tokens and a task instruction q = {q1,...,qm}, the goal of context compression is to produce a compressed context c′ ⊆ c such that |c′| ≤ B, where B is the computational budget in tokens. The objective is to maximize task performance while satisfying the budget constraint. For instance, in the code completion task, the instruction could be: ”Complete the following function [code to be completed]”. The long context could consist of the unfinished code along with retrieved code snippets.

Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) [28], [29] provides an efficient way to condense overly lengthy contexts. RAG

Fig. 2: Overview of the LongCodeZip framework.

Rather than relying solely on embedding similarity between q and c, we propose to select context snippets based on their mutual information, specifically, how much they reduce the perplexity (PPL) of generating q. Specifically, for each candidate context c, we define the approximated mutual information AMI(c,q) as the reduction in perplexity when c is provided:

compression stage (Section III-D), each retained function is further segmented into semantic blocks via perplexity-based chunking. An adaptive retention ratio is assigned to each function according to its estimated importance. Within each function, the most relevant blocks are selected by formulating the problem as a 0/1 knapsack optimization, ensuring that the retained content maximizes relevance while fitting within the allocated token budget.

AMI(c,q) = PPL(q) − PPL(q | c) (1)

By combining coarse-grained filtering with fine-grained pruning, LongCodeZip achieves a balance between aggressive compression and semantic preservation, thereby improving both efficiency and task performance.

where PPL(q | c) is the conditional perplexity of q given c, lower values indicate higher likelihood of q [23]:

N

1 N

log P(qi|q<i,c) (2)

PPL(q|c) = exp −

i=1

C. Coarse-Grained Compression: Relevant Function Selection

Similarly, PPL(q) denotes the perplexity of q without the context:

The coarse-grained compression aims to select high-level code chunks that are most relevant to the task instruction. This process consists of three steps:

N

1 N

log P(qi|q<i) (3)

PPL(q) = exp −

i=1

Function-Level Chunking. We first split the source code into chunks along function or class boundaries. Functions naturally encapsulate coherent logic and exhibit strong modularity [31]. Chunking at this level ensures that retained code segments are both syntactically valid and semantically self-contained, which is essential for preserving program integrity.

Here, P denotes the model’s next-token prediction probability, and q<i is the sequence of preceding tokens before qi. A higher AMI score indicates that c enables the model to better predict q, capturing both surface-level and dependency-based relevance. We therefore compress long contexts by retaining code snippets with the highest mutual information, ensuring that the most essential information for code generation is preserved.

Instruction-aware Relevance Ranking. To measure the relevance of each chunk to the task instruction, we employ an instruction-aware ranking mechanism based on approximated mutual information (1). Chunks are scored and ranked in descending order, allowing us to prioritize those most informative for the given task.

B. Overview

The overview of LongCodeZip is illustrated in Figure 2. Given input of long source code, a task instruction, and a token budget, LongCodeZip follows a coarse-to-fine compression pipeline. In the coarse-grained compression stage (Section III-C), the source code is divided into function-level chunks, which are ranked by their relevance to the instruction using conditional perplexity. The top N functions are then selected under a coarse budget, effectively filtering out irrelevant code and avoiding unnecessary computation. In the fine-grained

Budget-Constrained Function Selection. Finally, we greedily select the top-ranked chunks under a coarse-grained token budget Bcoarse, which is the division of the final token budget B by the configurable fine-grained compression ratio Rfine. This greedy selection balances efficiency and coverage: a larger budget allows more functions to pass into the finegrained stage, potentially improving downstream quality but at

Algorithm 1: Pseudo code of Adaptive Fine-Grained Budget Allocation

Input: Large functions {f1,...,fN} with min-max normalized AMI scores {AMI1,...,AMIN} and token counts {T1,...,TN}; total token budget for large functions Blarge; baseline retention ratio Rbase; importance parameter β

Output: Function-wise adjusted retention rates

Rbiased,i ← Rbase · (1 + β · (2 × AMIi − 1)); //

#### i Rbiased,j·Tj ; // Adjust rate return R1,...,RN;

higher computational cost, while a smaller budget accelerates processing at the risk of discarding useful code. Chunks not selected are replaced with placeholders (e.g., comment markers or ellipses), which preserve the global structure while reducing overall context length.

- D. Fine-Grained Compression: Intra-Function Pruning

After selecting relevant function-level chunks in the first stage, we apply finer-grained compression to further reduce context length while preserving critical content. This process involves three steps:

Block-Level Chunking. The main challenge in intra-function compression is pruning code without breaking internal logic. To address this, each function is segmented into smaller, semantically coherent blocks. A naive idea is to split code by whitespace lines, but such line-based heuristics often misalign with semantic boundaries. Inspired by techniques in natural language processing [32], we employ a perplexity-based method to identify semantic block boundaries within code. While perplexity-based grouping has shown effectiveness in natural language segmentation, it remains under-explored in code. Consecutive lines in code often form strong semantic associations, making perplexity a useful signal. Within a semantically coherent region, perplexity tends to decrease as context accumulates [32]. We treat each line of code as the smallest atomic unit and group consecutive lines based on their perplexity scores, calculated as in (3). When a line’s perplexity exhibits a sharp local increase, exceeding that of its neighbors by at least α times of the standard deviation over all lines, we mark it as a block boundary. Such high-perplexity lines typically mark the beginning of a new block, reflecting underlying semantic or structural changes. This perplexityguided aggregation allows blocks to capture meaningful code segments while preserving the code structure.

Adaptive Budget Allocation. Functions selected in the coarse-grained stage vary in importance. Hence, applying a

uniform compression ratio across all of them is suboptimal. To address this, we introduce an adaptive budget allocation mechanism that distributes the fine-grained token budget proportionally to function importance. Functions with higher AMI scores receive more token budgets, preserving greater detail, while very small functions Fsmall (shorter than five lines) are kept in full. Algorithm 1 summarizes the procedure.

We first define the baseline retention ratio for large functions:

B − j∈Fsmall Tj k∈Flarge Tk

, (4)

Rbase =

where B is the final token budget, Fsmall and Flarge represent the sets of small and large functions respectively, and Tj denotes the number of tokens in function j.

For functions f1,...,fN selected in the coarse-grained stage, we perform min-max normalization to all AMI scores to AMInorm,i.

For each large function fi, and its normalized AMI score AMInorm,i ∈ [0,1], a biased retention ratio is then computed as

#### Rbiased,i = Rbase · (1 + β · (2 × AMInorm,i − 1)), (5)

where Rbase is the baseline retention ratio for large functions (Equation 4). The importance parameter β adjusts sensitivity to importance. When the importance parameter is set to 0, there is no bias, meaning all functions are treated equally. A more positive β increases the emphasis on important functions, allocating more tokens to them. All retention rates are clamped to [0,1] and globally rescaled so that the total number of retained tokens matches the target token budget for large functions Blarge:

Blarge j Rbiased,j · Tj

, (6)

Ri = Rbiased,i ·

where Tj represents the number of tokens in the j-th function. This adjustment preserves the relative importance between functions while ensuring the global constraint is satisfied.

Dynamic Block Selection. For each function, LongCodeZip identifies a subset of blocks to retain, aiming to maximize the total relevance within the constraints of the allocated token budget. This strategy ensures that the compressed context achieves the highest possible information density. We formulate this selection as a classic 0/1 knapsack problem: each block is treated as an item, where the value corresponds to its normalized AMI score and the weight corresponds to its token length. The detailed procedure is outlined in Algorithm 2. We employ a dynamic programming approach to compute the optimal subset of blocks that satisfies the budget constraint while maximizing the cumulative value.

IV. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP A. Research Questions (RQs)

RQ1: Can LongCodeZip effectively compress code context while preserving the downstream performance?

to the performance?

- RQ3: Does LongCodeZip exhibit cross-model generaliza-

tion capabilities?

- RQ4: What is the efficiency benefit of LongCodeZip in

downstream tasks?

- B. Datasets

We evaluate our method on long code context benchmarks across three common tasks: code completion, code summarization, and code question answering. These tasks reflect practical developer needs and assess whether compressed code retains sufficient information for downstream performance. For each task, we construct prompts following the benchmark papers [1], [21], [13]. Dataset statistics are shown in Table I.

The Long Code Completion dataset [1] targets the code completion task under long-context of relevant functions. To highlight long-context difficulties, we filtered the test set to 500 Python examples with input contexts longer than 5,000 tokens. The Long Module Summarization dataset [21] contains 216 examples from 43 Python repositories. To focus on the challenging long-context scenario, we also further filtered the original dataset to 139 examples that have more than 2,000 context tokens. RepoQA [13] is a multilingual benchmark that contains 600 long code question answering tests across 60 repositories and 6 programming languages. It requires the model to locate and return a function within the long context using a natural language instruction, similar to a retrieval task.

- C. Baselines and Models

We evaluate LongCodeZip against a variety of competitive baselines:

- 1) No Compression: The full code context is used without any compression, representing the upper bound of performance.
- 2) No Context: The model is evaluated with only the task instruction, without any context, representing the lower bound.

- 3) Random Baselines: Random Token randomly removes individual tokens, while Random Line randomly removes the whole lines of code.
- 4) Retrieval-based Methods: RAG (Sliding Window) uses fixed-size overlapping chunks, whereas RAG (Function Chunking) splits code at function boundaries. Both methods use the state-of-the-art code embedding model UniXCoderbase [30], [29].
- 5) Code Compression Methods: We compare against the compression components from DietCode [26] and SlimCode [27]. DietCode was originally implemented for Python and Java, while SlimCode supports only Java. To enable direct comparison on other benchmarks, we reproduce the SlimCode for Python with tree-sitter2.
- 6) Text Compression Methods: We also include several state-of-the-art prompt compression methods for natural languages, including LLMLingua [23], LongLLMLingua [33], and LLMLingua-2 [34].

All methods are evaluated on a diverse set of code LLMs, covering both earlier models like Deepseek-Coder-6.7B [10] and latest models like Qwen2.5-Coder-7B [11] and SeedCoder-8B [12]. Specifically, we use the instruct version of these models from Huggingface3. To further demonstrate the generalizability of LongCodeZip, we also extend our evaluation to state-of-the-art closed-source models, including GPT4o4 and Claude-3.7-Sonnet5.

D. Evaluation Metrics

The evaluation of LongCodeZip encompasses two primary dimensions: compression efficiency and downstream generation performance with compressed context. We report compression Ratio on all tasks:

Ratio = |Coriginal|

(7)

|Ccompressed|

where |Ccompressed| and |Coriginal| denote the number of tokens in the compressed and original contexts respectively.

For the code completion task, We follow LongCoder [1] to evaluate the performance of the models in terms of Exact Match (EM) and Edit Similarity (ES).

For the code summarization task, we follow [21] to use a third party model GPT-4O-MINI 6 to evaluate which summary better explains the code between the ground truth and the generated one. This LLM-as-Judge evaluation strategy is widely adopted in both NLP and software engineering domains [35], [36], as it has been demonstrated to align well with human preferences and provides more nuanced evaluation compared to traditional metrics [37], [38]. The model chooses the better summary after reviewing both options alongside the code. To

CompScore =

[P(so ≻ sˆ) + (1 − P(ˆs ≻ so))] (8)

where P(so ≻ sˆ) is the probability that the referee model prefers the generated summary so over the reference sˆ, and P(ˆs ≻ so) is the probability for the reverse order. Scomp ranges from 0 to 100, with 50 indicating equal preference.

For the code QA task, we follow [13] to evaluate the retrieval accuracy of needle functions, reporting the percentage of models that retrieve a correct match above a BLEU similarity threshold of 0.8 between the generated function fo and the target function fˆ: BLEU(f,fˆ o) > 0.8.

- E. Implementation Details

We tailored hyperparameters for each distinct task, consistently mirroring the generation model with our compression model. For code completion, which demands focused context, we set the token budget B to 2k, the fine-grained ratio (Rfine) to 0.8, and the importance adjustment parameter (β) to 0.5. Conversely, code summarization necessitates understanding broader context within large modules; consequently, we increased B to 5k, reduced Rfine to 0.3, and maintained β at 0.5. For the RepoQA task, where the objective is to precisely replicate entire functions, we set B to 2k and Rfine to 1.0 to ensure the structural integrity of functions. These values for B, β, and Rfine were determined through experiments on a small held-out set that did not overlap with the test data. All experiments were conducted on a system equipped with an Intel Xeon Gold 6254 CPU and an NVIDIA A100-80G GPU.

V. RESULTS

- A. RQ1: Effectiveness on Code Compression

Tables II, III, and IV present the evaluation results of our approach on three downstream tasks, respectively. The best scores among compression methods are bolded. Across all three tasks and multiple backbone models, LongCodeZip consistently outperforms compression baselines by substantial and statistically significant margins (p < 0.001 via Wilcoxon signed-rank test on 10 repeated experiments), even when operating at comparable or stricter compression ratios.

Specifically, on the Long Code Completion task, RAGbased methods achieve higher ES and EM scores than other baseline methods, but still fall short of our approach. For instance, with Qwen2.5-Coder-7B, RAG (Function Chunking) achieves an ES score of 52.79 and an EM score of 26.00 at a 3.1× compression ratio. In contrast, our approach achieves 57.55 ES and 32.40 EM at a stricter 4.3× compression ratio, representing a 28% shorter compressed context than the RAG

method. This demonstrates that our method not only preserves more critical information for code completion but also does so with significantly greater compression efficiency.

In contrast to the code completion results, RAG-based methods do not show clear advantages over other baselines on the Long Module Summarization task. However, our approach remains the most competitive, achieving a CompScore of 28.01 with Deepseek-Coder-6.7B at a 2.5× compression ratio—surpassing other compression baselines by a considerable margin. This highlights the effectiveness of our method in preserving relevant semantic content for summarization, even with shorter input contexts.

On the RepoQA task, LLMLingua and LLMLingua-2 exhibit poor performance because token-level compression corrupts code syntax and structure, while LongLLMLingua improves this dramatically by performing coarse-grained document-level to fine-grained token-level compression, using instruction-aware contrastive perplexity to preserve code

segments highly relevant to the instruction. Nonetheless, our approach consistently achieves the best performance across all models. Notably, on Deepseek-Coder-6.7B, our approach surpasses LongLLMLingua by 16% in overall score while compressing the context to half the length. This underscores the superior effectiveness of our method in both information retention and aggressive compression for long code understanding.

Notably, LongCodeZip demonstrates strong generalizability across state-of-the-art closed-source models. As comprehensively shown in Table V, on GPT-4o, LongCodeZip achieves an ES score of 64.72 (vs. 65.13 no-compression baseline) on Long Code Completion at a 4.3x compression ratio, closely matching the performance of the uncompressed input while significantly reducing context length. For the RepoQA task, LongCodeZip even surpasses the no-compression baseline, achieving 88.9 average score on GPT-4o, demonstrating that removing irrelevant context can improve performance on complex reasoning tasks. On the more powerful Claude-3.7Sonnet, LongCodeZip achieves 66.27 ES (vs. 66.24 baseline) with the same compression efficiency. For the RepoQA task, LongCodeZip also surpasses the no-compression baseline on Claude-3.7-Sonnet, achieving 90.7 average score, further demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

We also conduct comprehensive comparisons with recent advanced approaches in code completion, including A3CodGen [39], cAST [40], RepoGenix [41], and RLCoder [42] across all evaluated models. As shown in Table VI, LongCodeZip consistently outperforms these advanced RAG methods across the most competitive open-source and closed-source models, SeedCoder and Claude-3.7-Sonnet. Our method can more efficiently retain essential information, achieving higher information density under the same token budget. This demonstrates the broad applicability and consistent effectiveness of our approach across diverse model architectures and capabilities. Notably, these RAG-based retrieval methods are complementary to our compression approach and could potentially be combined with our framework to further enhance performance by first retrieving relevant content and then applying our compression techniques.

Overall, our method achieves effectiveness on par with or better than the No Compression setting, and consistently outperforms all compression baselines across tasks and backbone models even under more aggressive compression.

- B. RQ2: Ablation Study

To understand the contribution of each component in LongCodeZip, we conduct an ablation study on the Long Code Completion task using Qwen2.5-Coder-7B. For all ablations, the total token budget and other hyper-parameters are set the same as the full method. We systematically remove or modify key components to analyze their individual impact. For coarsegrained ablations, we replace our conditional perplexity-based

ranking with similarity-based ranking, and compare against random function ranking to establish a lower bound. For finegrained ablations, we test four variants: removing fine-grained compression entirely (coarse-grained selection only), removing adaptive budget allocation (uniform budget allocation), replacing meta-chunking with simple line-based chunking, and using random line selection within selected functions.

Different components contribute varying degrees to performance. The coarse-grained ranking mechanism is most critical - conditional perplexity-based ranking outperforms similaritybased approaches by 7.89% and random selection by 17.79% in ES score. This demonstrates that semantic relevance through conditional perplexity is superior to lexical similarity. For finegrained components, adaptive budget allocation improves ES by 2.34%, enabling important functions to retain more detail. Perplexity-based chunking outperforms simple line chunking by 1.57% in ES while being more computationally efficient, as line-by-line compression ranking would incur higher overhead compared to block-based analysis. Knapsack-based selection outperforms random line selection by 2.48% in ES, confirming relevance-guided selection helps compression quality.

### Finding 2

Coarse-grained conditional perplexity ranking has the most impact on the performance of LongCodeZip, while fine-grained optimizations further improve the compression information density.

- C. RQ3: Transferability

Table VIII presents the cross-model performance (ES) of our approach in the long code completion task. Each row denotes the model used for context compression, while each column specifies the model used for code generation given the compressed context as the input. The results show that our approach generalizes well across different model architectures and sizes, regardless of which compression or generation model is used for downstream tasks. Models released at different times, from DeepSeek-Coder in 2023 [10] to Qwen2.5Coder in 2024 [11] and Seed-Coder in 2025 [12], achieve similarly strong performance with only minor differences in average ES scores. Notably, even small models (e.g., Qwen2.5-Coder-0.5B) are highly effective, highlighting the strong transferability of our method. Using such small models will significantly reduce compression time and memory overhead, making our approach particularly suitable for resourceconstrained scenarios.

Finding 3

Our LongCodeZip generalizes well across different types and sizes of models in the cross-model setting, using a 0.5B model can also bring promising performance.

- D. RQ4: Efficiency Analysis

To evaluate the practical efficiency of LongCodeZip, we analyze the Long Code Completion task using Qwen2.5-Coder7B by measuring both compression overhead and downstream benefits. We select several representative baselines based on their downstream performance in Table IX. The GPU memory costs represent peak memory usage per stage, with generation memory cost referring to additional memory for forward propagation during generation beyond base model parameters (28.37GB). Due to the space limit, we only report the results with several representative baselines. Note that SlimCode and DietCode require no GPU memory for compression because they are not based on neural models.

Table IX demonstrates that LongCodeZip achieves superior compression efficiency while maintaining the best performance. While our method requires a slightly higher compression overhead of 2.58s and additional GPU memory compared to the baselines, it significantly reduces input token costs by 77% and decreases generation latency from 15.70s to 6.59s compared to no compression. This also translates to substantial

cost savings when using expensive commercial LLM APIs, where pricing is primarily based on input token count. More importantly, as demonstrated in RQ3, the compression overhead can be effectively mitigated by using a lightweight 0.5B model without sacrificing quality. And the efficiency gains can also be further enhanced through techniques like quantization [43], making our approach highly practical for real-world deployment scenarios where cost efficiency is paramount.

### Finding 4

Our LongCodeZip achieves 4.3× compression ratio with only 2.6s overhead, reduces generation time from 15.7s to 6.6s, yet it still maintains high downstream performance.

VI. DISCUSSION A. Compression vs Performance

Understanding the relationship between compression ratio and model performance is essential for evaluating the effectiveness of code compression methods in long-context scenarios. Figure 3 presents the ES score versus the percentage of remaining context, showing Qwen2.5-Code-7B results for representative methods on the Long Code Completion task. LongCodeZip consistently achieves the highest ES scores across all compression ratios, demonstrating its strong ability to identify and retain the most relevant context for code completion. Notably, LongCodeZip can effectively leverage additional context, resulting in substantial performance gains—especially at severe compression ratios (with remaining context less than 10%) where context is extremely limited. This gain becomes less pronounced at more relaxed compression ratios, which is reasonable since our method

ranks and selects the most relevant functions early on, so the marginal benefit of extra context diminishes. In contrast, most baselines perform close to random selection, and adding more context does not significantly improve their ES scores. Among the baselines, RAG-based methods do exhibit improvement as more context is retained, but their overall ES scores remain significantly lower than those of LongCodeZip.

This adaptive design allows LongCodeZip to accommodate different deployment scenarios and cost constraints.

VII. THREATS TO VALIDITY

While our evaluation is comprehensive, several threats to validity should be acknowledged. 1) A primary threat concerns the accuracy of our evaluation for the summarization evaluation relies on LLM-generated scores, which may differ from human expert assessments and potentially suffer from ordering effects. To mitigate this, we followed the original paper [21] to average scores over different prompt orderings and employed GPT-4o-mini as an independent referee. These practices reduce bias and improve the objectivity of our results. 2) Our findings may be specific to the datasets, programming languages, or LLMs used. To improve generalizability, we evaluated our approach across diverse datasets, languages, model families, and in cross-model settings. This diversity provides convincing evidence on the generalizability of our findings. 3) There is a risk of data leakage if models are exposed to benchmark data during training. To exclude potential effects of data leakage, we used DeepSeek-Coder-6.7B [10], which was trained only on data available before March 2023, while all the benchmarks we evaluated were released after that date [1], [21], [13]. This step helps ensure the integrity and reliability of our results.

- B. Case Study

We illustrate the effectiveness of LongCodeZip through a case study in Figure 4, focusing on the fine-grained compression stage (coarse-grained design choice is discussed in Section II). Our method identifies semantic boundaries at positions where a line’s perplexity sharply increases relative to its neighbors. The method tends to separate out major, independent functional modules, and also naturally groups together smaller, closely related segments. Some of our detected boundaries align with double newlines, which is consistent with common programming practices in codes with good code smell. The resulting compressed blocks, highlighted by boxes in the right panel, preserve the key information need for completion. The preserved blocks closely matches the code to be completed. This shows our approach effectively compresses code while retaining relevant and useful content to the task.

In our experiments, we have also observed some common failure modes. In particular, when the context either lacks information relevant to the task instruction or when it is difficult to align an ambiguous instruction with any segment of the context, our method may struggle to identify and preserve useful blocks.

- C. Necessity of Two-staged Compression

VIII. RELATED WORK A. Large Language Models for Code

General-purpose LLMs such as GPT [44], Gemini [45], [46], Qwen [47], [48] and DeepSeek [49] demonstrate strong code capabilities through large-scale pretraining on diverse data. To better perform on code-related tasks, a series of codespecialized LLMs have been proposed. CodeX [50] adapts GPT architecture and is pretrained on a large corpus of GitHub code using next-token prediction. Similarly, CodeGen [51] adopts a decoder-only architecture, with a focus on multi-turn program synthesis and open-source availability. StarCoder [52], on the contrary, adopts a fill-in-the-middle objective for improved bidirectional context modeling. CodeLlama [14] extends LLaMA with code-specific tokenization and longer contexts. CodeT5+[53] employs span denoising in

While the coarse-grained step provides the largest compression gains by removing entire irrelevant functions, the finegrained compression step is crucial for balancing the trade-off between compression overhead and task model cost. Users can disable the fine-grained step for faster, cheaper compression when using less expensive models. However, for powerful but costly APIs like Claude-3.7-Sonnet, the precise pruning from the fine-grained step becomes critical, yielding substantial cost reductions that justify the additional computational overhead.

an encoder-decoder framework. More recent models further incorporate instruction tuning and reinforcement learning (RL) to improve alignment and generalization. WizardCoder [54] fine-tunes StarCoder [52] with Evol-Instruct and ChatGPT [55] feedback. DeepSeek-Coder [10] combines instruction tuning, RL and compiler feedback to optimize for correctness and human preference. Qwen2.5-Coder [11] also undergoes instruction tuning and RL, with a focus on long-context fidelity through multi-stage alignment.

These models have demonstrated remarkable performance in downstream tasks such as code generation [51], [56], code summarization [57], [58], and code question answering [59], [60]. Despite increasingly longer context windows, LLMs exhibit significant limitations in long context scenarios, especially when relevant information appears in the middle of a prompt [19], [20] or when code completion requires crossfunction or structural dependencies [21], [61]. To address these challenges, a number of long code benchmarks have been introduced, such as LongCodeBench [62], LongCodeU [63], YABLoCo [64], and LongCodeArena [21]. In parallel, recent research has tailored models to code tasks specifically. LongCoder [1] adopts a sliding window mechanism for self-attention to enhance long-context code completion. HiRoPE [65] leverages the hierarchical structure of source code to enable length extrapolation without additional training. aiXcoder-7B-v2 [66] introduces reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning to guide LLMs in utilizing long-range context for repository-level code completion. Complementing these architectural and training advancements, we propose an efficient code context compression technique that preserves essential semantic information while enabling LLMs to operate effectively within constrained input lengths.

B. Context Compression of Large Language Models

Context compression strategies can be categorized into hard prompt methods and soft prompt methods [67]. Soft prompt methods [68], [69], [70] summarize input into dense vectors or prefix embeddings. While memory-efficient, they require fine-tuning on the target model, making them impractical in closed-source settings like using GPT-4. In contrast, hard prompt methods directly manipulate the input by removing or rephrasing less informative content. LLMLingua [23], LongLLMLingua [33], and Selective Context [24] use learned or statistical importance scores to prune uninformative tokens or sentences. LLMLingua-2 [34] advances this by employing data distillation from GPT-4 to train a token classification model, achieving efficient and faithful compression. AttentionRAG [71] prunes the context based on the attention between queries and retrieved contexts.

However, these methods are primarily designed for natural language, and often fail to capture the structural and semantic regularities of source code, leading to suboptimal performance in code-related tasks. This has led to a growing body of research focused on code-specific compression. ShortenDoc [72] targets docstring compression specifically, whereas our method targets source code, which typically dominates the

input in long-context scenarios. DietCode [26] combines static frequency-based filtering with CodeBERT attention heuristics to discard low-impact tokens, but its reliance on model-specific attention reduces adaptability across different architectures. SlimCode[27] applies rule-based token pruning using token types and program dependency graphs, which may not generalize well across languages or tasks. However, these existing methods mainly focus on compressing single functions for short context tasks.

Additionally, advanced RAG-based approaches have been developed for enhancing repository-level code completion by retrieving relevant context, including A3-CodGen [39], which incorporates third-party library information; cAST [40], which leverages structural chunking via abstract syntax trees; RepoGenix [41], which combines analogous and relevant contexts; and RLCoder [42], which trains stronger retrievers for improved context selection. Unlike these approaches that are specifically designed for repository-level code completion, we propose a training-free code context compression technique that provides broader applicability across diverse long-context code tasks including summarization and question answering by preserving essential semantic information while enabling existing LLMs to operate effectively within constrained input lengths. Our contribution lies in the synergistic integration and significant code-aware approach to address the unique structural and semantic characteristics of programming languages.

To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first to explicitly target long-context compression in code LLMs, providing a training-free and model-agnostic solution that efficiently preserves task-relevant content under tight token budgets.

IX. CONCLUSION

In this paper, we have introduced LongCodeZip, a trainingfree, model-agnostic and plug-and-play framework for longcontext code compression. Our two-stage hierarchical approach combines function-level selection with block-level pruning. Comprehensive experiments across code completion, summarization, and question answering tasks demonstrate that LongCodeZip achieves up to a 5.6x compression ratio without sacrificing task performance, consistently outperforms existing baselines, and significantly reduces computational costs. The framework exhibits strong cross-model generalization and maintains competitive performance even with a lightweight 0.5B compression model. As the first framework specifically designed for long-context code compression, LongCodeZip enables code LLMs to scale more efficiently to real-world, large-scale software development scenarios.
