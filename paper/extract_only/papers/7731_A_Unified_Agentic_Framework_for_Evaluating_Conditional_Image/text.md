Conditional image generation has gained significant attention for its ability to personalize content. However, the field faces challenges in developing task-agnostic, reliable, and explainable evaluation metrics. This paper introduces CIGEVAL, a unified agentic framework for comprehensive evaluation of conditional image generation tasks. CIGEVAL utilizes large multimodal models (LMMs) as its core, integrating a multi-functional toolbox and establishing a fine-grained evaluation framework. Additionally, we synthesize evaluation trajectories for fine-tuning, empowering smaller LMMs to autonomously select appropriate tools and conduct nuanced analyses based on tool outputs. Experiments across seven prominent conditional image generation tasks demonstrate that CIGEVAL (GPT-4o version) achieves a high correlation of 0.4625 with human assessments, closely matching the inter-annotator correlation of 0.47. Moreover, when implemented with 7B open-source LMMs using only 2.3K training trajectories, CIGEVAL surpasses the previous GPT-4o-based state-of-the-art method. Case studies on GPT-4o image generation highlight CIGEVAL’s capability in identifying subtle issues related to subject consistency and adherence to control guidance, indicating its great potential for automating evaluation of image generation tasks with human-level reliability1.

By integrating GPT-4o with tools, CIGEVAL, our agentic evaluation framework, highlights the glasses object in both images, and finds their different shapes and designs, thereby reaching the correct score. “Source” and “Subject” means “source image” and “subject image”.

text-guided image generation is particularly popular (Ramesh et al., 2022; Chen et al., 2025; Yuan et al., 2025). Expanding beyond text, a diverse set of conditions have been employed to steer the diffusion process: text-guided image editing (Brooks et al., 2023), mask-guided image editing (runwayml, 2023), subject-driven image generation and editing (Chen et al., 2023; Guo et al., 2024), multiconcept image composition (Kumari et al., 2023) and control-guided image generation (Qin et al., 2023; Zhang and Agrawala, 2023).

### 1 Introduction

Recent advances in large-scale text-to-image (T2I) generative models have enabled the creation of images based on text prompts as well as reference images, i.e. conditional image generation (Kumari et al., 2023; Ruiz et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023b; He et al., 2024). The field is evolving at an unprecedented pace with an increasing number of tasks and models being introduced. Among these,

Despite the growing number of generative models being developed, a significant challenge persists in effectively evaluating AI-synthesized images (Peng et al., 2024). Current evaluation metrics have the following three limitations: (1) Taskspecific: Traditional metrics are narrowly focused

and cannot be generalized across different tasks. For example, LPIPS (Zhang et al., 2018) measures the perceptual similarity of a pair of images, while CLIP-Score (Hessel et al., 2021) measures the text alignment of one single image. (2) Limited explainability: Assigning a single score to a generated image without the reasoning process fails to offer a comprehensive evaluation. Images can be assessed on multiple dimensions, such as prompt adherence and concept preservation (Fu et al., 2023b). (3) Lack of human alignment: Traditional metrics like DINO (Caron et al., 2021) and CLIP (Radford et al., 2021) often result in huge discrepancies from humans, caused by their image similarity measurement nature. Even based on the powerful large multimodal model (LMM) GPT-4o, as shown in Figure 1, the current state-of-the-art VIEScore (Ku et al., 2024) struggles to capture subtle image nuances and shows low correlation with human judgment in various image editing tasks.

To address these issues, we propose CIGEVAL, an autonomous LMM-based agent framework for evaluating conditional image generation. This agent framework can integrate the advanced GPT4o model (OpenAI, 2023) and open-source models (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL (Wang et al., 2024)). Our work is driven by two primary motivations: (1) developing autonomous evaluation agents capable of making independent decisions and judgments without human assistance; (2) enabling relatively smaller models to efficiently perform complex evaluations. To achieve this, we make three key technical contributions. First, we extend the LMM’s capability to detect and emphasize subtle differences between highly similar images by curating a versatile toolbox, in contrast to previous methods that relied solely on the perceptual capabilities of LMMs. Second, we establish a fine-grained evaluation framework, including task decomposition, tool selection and analysis. Third, we synthesize instruction data based on evaluation trajectories for fine-tuning the LMM, where we first employ GPT-4o to execute the stages and then filter the trajectories that align with human evaluations.

Experiments on the well-established ImagenHub benchmark (Ku et al., 2023) show that, when using GPT-4o as the underlying LMM, CIGEVAL achieves the state-of-the-art performance across all 7 tasks. It achieves an average Spearman correlation of 0.4625 with human raters, closely matching the human-to-human correlation of 0.47. The primary improvements are observed in tasks involv-

ing multiple conditions, such as control-guided image generation and multi-concept image composition, where previous evaluation metrics struggle. Using only 2.3K filtered evaluation trajectories for tuning, CIGEVAL, leveraging 7B open-source LMMs, demonstrates performance surpassing previous GPT-4o-based state-of-the-art methods. Further ablation study shows the importance of each tool and the robustness of our framework. In addition, we conduct a preliminary case study on GPT-4o’s image generation. CIGEVAL assigns scores closely aligned with human annotations and effectively detects subtle flaws in 4o-generated images, especially in tasks involving multiple input images and adherence to specific control signals (e.g., Canny edges, OpenPose). These results suggest that CIGEVAL has substantial promise for achieving human-level performance in assessing synthetic images.

Our main contributions are as follows:

- • We introduce CIGEVAL, an LMM-based evaluation agent designed to assess various conditional image generation tasks. Our approach is characterized by its human-aligned, explainable, and unified evaluation method, setting it apart from previous metrics.
- • We evaluate CIGEVAL across 7 conditional image generation tasks, demonstrating that CIGEVAL, based on GPT-4o, outperforms all existing baselines and achieves a high correlation with human annotators, closely mirroring the human-to-human correlation.
- • We fine-tune open-sourced 7B LMMs and significantly improve their evaluation performance, surpassing previous GPT-4o-based state-of-the-art method.

### 2 Related Work

#### 2.1 Conditional Image Generation

Diffusion models have gained wide attention in AI research for image synthesis (Ho et al., 2020; Dhariwal and Nichol, 2021). In recent years, several new models (Kumari et al., 2023; Ruiz et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023b; Zhang and Agrawala, 2023) have been developed to introduce controllable conditions in image generation. Prevalent tasks in this domain include text-to-image generation (Saharia et al., 2022; Rombach et al., 2022; stability.ai, 2023) (known as text-guided image generation),

inpainting (Avrahami et al., 2022; Lugmayr et al., 2022) (referred to as mask-guided image editing) and text-guided image editing (Brooks et al., 2023; Couairon et al., 2022; Wu and la Torre, 2023). Recent works have proposed new tasks, such as subject-driven image generation and editing (Gal

- et al., 2022; Ruiz et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023b) to inject one specific subject into a synthesized image, and multi-concept image composition (Kumari
- et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023; Ding et al., 2024), which allows multiple specific subjects into the synthesized image. Additionally, control-guided image generation (Zhang and Agrawala, 2023; Qin

- et al., 2023; Guo et al., 2024) allows additional conditions alongside the text prompt to guide the image synthesis. Our work employs LMM-based agents to assess all of these discussed tasks.

#### 2.2 Synthetic Image Evaluation

A variety of metrics have been introduced to assess AI-generated images. For example, the CLIP score (Hessel et al., 2021) and BLIP score (Li et al., 2022) are commonly used to measure the alignment between the generated image and the text prompt. Metrics like LPIPS (Zhang et al., 2018) and DreamSim (Fu et al., 2023b) focus on assessing perceptual similarity. LLMScore (Lu et al., 2023) and HEIM-benchmark (Lee et al., 2023) assess text-to-image models on multiple fine-grained aspects, including toxicity and safety. However, these metrics predominantly focused on text-to-image generation and remain narrow in scope. There is a noticeable lack of effective automatic metrics for other conditional image generation tasks, such as subject-driven image generation and image editing (Ruiz et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023b; Peng et al., 2024). Consequently, some research work (Denton et al., 2015; Isola et al., 2017; Meng et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2023; Sheynin et al., 2023) rely heavily on human evaluation. This dependence highlights the need for more unified, interpretable, and reliable automatic evaluation methods in the field. Our work seeks to bridge this gap by developing an autonomous agentic evaluation framework that closely aligns with human judgment.

#### 2.3 Large Multimodal Models as Evaluators

Motivated by the explorations of large language model (LLM)-based evaluators in natural language processing (Zheng et al., 2023; Dubois et al., 2023; Fu et al., 2023a; Cheng et al., 2024b), large multimodal models (LMMs) have been utilized to evalu-

ate responses in visual question answering (Chen et al., 2024a; Xu et al., 2024). In the realm of image evaluation, the GPT-4 series has demonstrated promising capabilities, particularly in assessing text-image alignment (Zhang et al., 2023b; Li et al., 2024). However, these models are not without limitations. A comprehensive study on GPT-4o’s vision abilities have revealed mistakes in fine-grained image evaluation tasks (Yang et al., 2023), such as failing to accurately distinguish differences between similar images (Ku et al., 2024). To address these shortcomings, we enhance the capabilities of LMMs by integrating a versatile set of image analysis and editing tools, and by adopting an agentic framework to improve the evaluation of AI-generated images.

### 3 CIGEVAL

In this section, we introduce CIGEVAL, our LMMbased agentic framework designed for evaluating conditional image generation. First, we define seven conditional image generation tasks that are the focus of our study (Sec. 3.1), and then design a multi-functional toolbox (Sec. 3.2). Next, we introduce our fine-grained evaluation framework

- (Sec. 3.3). Finally, we synthesize high-quality trajectory data to fine-tune open-source LMMs
- (Sec. 3.4).

#### 3.1 Task Definition

To build a unified and explainable evaluation metric, we define the image evaluation problem as shown in Equation 1. The function feval takes as input an instruction I, a synthesized image O, and a set of conditions C∗ (e.g. text prompt, subject image, background image, canny-edge, etc). The function feval should produce the intermediate rationale in natural language before generating the final score according to the instruction I:

feval(I,O,C∗) = (rationale,score) (1)

Following Ku et al. (2023), we focus on seven primary conditional image generation tasks, each with different sets of conditions C∗:

- • Text-guided Image Generation: C∗ = [p], where p is a text prompt. The objective is to generate an image that aligns with the text description.
- • Mask-guided Image Editing: C∗ = [p,Imask, Isrc], where Imask is a binarized mask and Isrc is a source image. The aim is to modify Isrc in the masked area according to p.

- • Text-guided Image Editing: C∗ = [p,Isrc]. This task is similar to Mask-guided Image Editing but does not provide a mask. The model must identify the region to edit automatically.
- • Subject-driven Image Generation: C∗ = [p, S], where S is the image of a specific subject. The aim is to generate an image that reflects p in relation to the subject S.
- • Subject-driven Image Editing: C∗ = [S,p, Isrc], where Isrc is a source image, and S is the subject reference. The goal is to replace the subject in Isrc with S.
- • Multi-concept Image Composition: C∗ = [S1,S2,p,Isrc], where S1 and S2 are images of two subjects. The task is to combine these to create a new image according to p.
- • Control-guided Image Generation: C∗ = [Icontrol,p], where Icontrol is a control signal, such as a depth map, canny edge, or bounding box. The aim is to generate an image that follows these lowlevel visual cues.

In this paper, following previous work (Mañas

- et al., 2024; Lin et al., 2024), we investigate the semantic consistency of generated images with the above conditions.

#### 3.2 Toolbox

Evaluating image generation that involves multiple conditions can be challenging. Drawing inspiration from prior research (Cheng et al.,

2024a; Zhang et al., 2024) we have developed a multi-functional toolbox, including Grounding, Difference, Highlight and Scene Graph. Each tool is designed to target specific aspects of image analysis or editing, and outputs either a modified image or textual information. Detailed descriptions of each tool can be found in Table 1.

Specifically, we implement Grounding with GroundingDino (Liu et al., 2024). Scene Graph uses the same prompting method as CCoT (Mitra et al., 2024) based on GPT-4o. This tool can also function effectively with other open-source LMMs (refer to Sec. 4.4). To assist LMMs in detecting subtle differences between edited images, the Difference tool compares the pixels of two images and identifies the locations of the variations. The Highlight tool emphasizes selected regions by reducing the pixel values of areas outside the highlighted zone to 1/4 of their original values, thereby darkening these areas and accentuating the highlighted region. This tool is typically used after the Grounding and Difference tools have provided the region coordinates.

#### 3.3 Framework

In our approach, we conceptualize the image evaluation process as an agent task. As shown in Figure 2, the core of CIGEVAL is a well-instructed LMM, which autonomously utilizes tools to assess a wide range of conditional image generation tasks.

accordance with the setting of Ku et al. (2023), we assume each sub-score weights the same and used min operation to emphasize the importance of meeting all criteria without exception.

Previous research has primarily relied on closedsource LMMs to address agentic tasks, mainly due to their superior abilities in tool calling and instruction following (Chen et al., 2024b; Song et al., 2024; Zeng et al., 2024; Xu et al., 2023). As evidenced in Table 3, open-source models significantly underperform compared to GPT-4o. To bridge this gap and empower smaller LMMs as effective evaluators, we aim to perform supervised fine-tuning on 7B models to integrate agentic capabilities into them.

Figure 2: The evaluation process of CIGEVAL regarding the example in Figure 1. CIGEVAL autonomously selects appropriate tools for each decomposed sub-task, and then conducts fine-grained analyses based on the observed tool outputs.

The prompts used in this framework are listed in Appendix A.

To curate high-quality trajectory data, we employ GPT-4o to carry out the evaluation process in Section 3.3. The process begins by providing GPT4o with evaluation instructions and corresponding images. At each turn, the agent receives an observation, formulates plans and thoughts as thought, and invokes relevant tools through action. The tool outputs serve as new observations for the subsequent turn. By iterating the above process, we can construct a complete evaluation trajectory including the initial instruction, intermediate steps (i.e., observations, thoughts, actions), and the final scoring result. To ensure the quality of these trajectories, we exclude samples where the discrepancy between predicted scores and human evaluation scores exceeds 0.3. Using 60% of the ImagenHub data, we ultimately gather 2,274 high-quality trajectories for supervised fine-tuning.

Specifically, we adopt a divide-and-conquer scheme for evaluating images generated under multiple conditions. For example, in the subject-driven image editing task in Figure 1, the desired synthesized image will incorporate the object from a subject reference while maintaining the background of the source image. Therefore, we break down each evaluation task into several fine-grained subquestions from the listed below: (1) Is the image generation following the prompt? (2) Is the image editing following the instruction? (3) Is the image performing minimal edit without changing the background? (4) Is the object in the Image following the provided subject? (5) Is the image following the control guidance? Then, for each sub-question, CIGEVAL selects the most suitable tool from its toolbox, focusing on the specific aspect of evaluation. For example, Grounding and Highlight are utilized for comparing specific regions of the image, while Scene Graph evaluates background preservation and the extent of over-editing. With these intermediate results, the LMM analyzes the tool outputs and assigns scores in the ReAct format (Yao et al., 2023), ranging from 0 to 10, which are normalized to the [0.0, 1.0] range for comparison with human ratings. These fine-grained scores are aggregated through:

Using this structured trajectory data, we perform supervised fine-tuning on Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct (Wang et al., 2024). Formally, each sample’s evaluation trajectory is represented as ⟨o0,t1,a1,...,on−1,tn,an,on⟩, where oi, ti, and ai denote the observation, thought, and action at each turn (i) respectively. Specifically, o0 refers to the initial observation consisting of the evaluation instructions and accompanied images, and on denotes the final score. At each turn, based on the preceding trajectory ci = ⟨o0,t1,a1,...,oi−1⟩, the agent aims to generate thought ti and action ai. During the fine-tuning process, we only compute the cross-entropy loss

O = min(α1,...,αi) (2) where αi represents one of the sub-scores. In

### 4 Experiments

#### 4.1 Evaluation Benchmark

ImagenHub (Ku et al., 2023) is a standardized benchmark for evaluating conditional image generation models with human raters. The statistics for ImagenHub are presented in Table 2. This large-scale benchmark covers 7 mainstream tasks, 29 models, 4.8K synthesized images, and 14.4K human ratings, making it suitable for calculating correlation scores between automatic evaluation metrics and human raters. A list of 29 evaluated models can be found in Appendix B.

Each image was assessed by three human raters according to the guidelines of the defined task, and a final score in the range [0.0, 1.0] was reported for the average score. Images are scored in two aspects: (1) Semantic Consistency assesses how well the generated image aligns with the given conditions, such as prompts and subject tokens, ensuring coherence and relevance to the specified task criteria. (2) Perceptual Quality evaluates the extent to which the generated image appears visually authentic and conveys a sense of naturalness. In this work, we focus on the Semantic Consistency score, leaving the exploration of Perceptual Quality for future research.

4.2 Existing Auto-metrics Here we list some prominent automatic metrics:

- • CLIP-Score (Hessel et al., 2021): This metric computes the average cosine similarities between prompt and generated image CLIP embeddings, making it a popular choice for assessing image-text alignment.
- • LPIPS (Zhang et al., 2018) measures the similarity between two images in a manner that aligns with human perception.
- • CLIP-I (Gal et al., 2022) calculates the average pairwise cosine similarities between CLIP embeddings of generated and source images.
- • DINO (Ruiz et al., 2023) is computed by the mean cosine similarity computed between the DINO embeddings of ViT-S/16 (Caron et al.,

2021) for both synthesized and source images.

• VIESCORE (Ku et al., 2024) prompts large multimodal models to evaluate generated images in an explainable and fine-grained manner. Based on GPT-4o, it currently represents the state-of-the-art across all seven tasks on ImagenHub.

#### 4.3 Implementation Details

In all experiments, GPT-4o refers to the model version GPT-4o-2024-05-13, aligning with the original VIESCORE paper (Ku et al., 2024). For the

- experiments in Sec. 4.4, we evaluate using the entire ImagenHub benchmark. In the ablation study, we randomly select 50 images for each task. For the
- experiments in Sec. 4.5, we generate training data using 60% of the ImagenHub dataset, as described in Section 3.4, and use the remaining data for testing. We fine-tune the Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct models using Megatron-LM. The fine-tuning process employs a learning rate of 1e-5 and a batch size of 128, with a sequence length of 32,768. We use AdamW optimizer with a cosine learning scheduler with 3% warm-up steps.

#### 4.4 Main Experiments

For all presented correlations, we applied Fisher Z-transformation to estimate the average Spearman correlation∈ [−1,1] across models and tasks.

Metric-to-Human (M-H) correlations. In Table 3, we present the correlations across all tasks, utilizing different backbone models. When using GPT-4o as the underlying LMM, CIGEVAL achieves the state-of-the-art performance across all 7 tasks. It achieves an average Spearman correlation of 0.4625 with human raters, closely matching the human-to-human correlation. The primary improvements are observed in tasks involving multiple conditions, such as control-guided image generation and multi-concept image composition, where previous evaluation metrics struggle.

When the underlying LMM is replaced with different open-source models, CIGEVAL consistently outperforms VIESCORE. However, the performance of open-source models is still poor and falls significantly behind GPT-4o. Therefore, we perform agent tuning on these models as described

- in Sec. 3.4 and report their improved performance
- in Sec. 4.5. Overall, the experiment demonstrates that CIGEVAL outperforms VIESCORE across a variety of image editing and generation tasks, consistently maintaining its edge even when different underlying LMMs are used.

companied with Grounding and Difference, we do not perform specific ablation on Highlight. The study shows that the complete CIGEVAL configuration achieves the highest average score of 0.7262. When each tool is removed, a noticeable drop is observed, underscoring the necessity of every tool for effective performance.

On the other hand, when the implementation of the Scene Graph was switched from GPT-4o to an open-source model, the evaluation results remained high with minimal variation. In fact, when replaced with the Qwen2.5-VL-70B, the performance improved further, showcasing the robustness of our agentic framework. Overall, the ablation study underscores that each tool in the CIGEVAL configuration is useful, and their collective integration is crucial for achieving superior performance.

VIEScore: There is some noticeable overediting with additional flowers placed around the bathroom unrelated to the tub, but the original scene remains mostly recognizable. 8 out of 10.

CIGEval (ours): Thought: To evaluate the degree of overediting, I need to assess the overall composition of the image to see if the added elements disrupt the original look and feel of the scene.

Original Image

Action: Use “Scene Graph” Tool Observation: {{"name": "smaller tub", "attributes": { "color": "white", "shape": "oval", "size": "small"}} Thought & Action: The edited image features significant overediting compared to the original. The original image contains one round bathtub and no flowers, while the edited version introduces a larger round tub and a smaller oval tub that were not present initially. 2 out of 10.

objects between two images. By grounding and highlighting the focused object (i.e., glasses and flowers), GPT-4o can find the difference in shapes and colors within our framework. In the second example, when discussing the background preservation aspect, VIESCORE considers the over-editing small. However, in our framework, CIGEVAL first calls the Scene Graph tool to get an overall composition of the edited image, and then finds out a newly-added tub based on tool outputs, successfully arriving at the correct score. These examples have shown CIGEVAL’s ability to autonomously select appropriate tools and reach correct conclusions based on the observation, which makes CIGEVAL a better evaluator than VIEScore.

The experimental results in Table 5 show the performance of CIGEVAL after agent tuning. Despite utilizing 7B open-source LMMs as the underlying model, Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-VL7B-Instruct demonstrate a 76% and 34% improvement in correlation after fine-tuning, respectively, With only 2,274 filtered evaluation trajectories, the fine-tuned 7B models surpass the previous state-ofthe-art VIEScore based on GPT-4o. This demonstrates the data efficiency of agent tuning and the importance of synthetic data quality.

#### 4.6 Case Study

To demonstrate the effectiveness of our CIGEVAL framework and the importance of each tool, we present a subject-driven image editing example in Figure 1, a text-guided image editing example in Figure 3, and a multi-concept image composition example in Figure 5. In the first and third example, by directly prompting in VIESCORE, GPT4o struggles to compare the similarity of specific

site2. Furthermore, we test GPT-4o image generation on ImagenHub’s various tasks and report the CIGEval scores and human annotations (averaged between two annotators). We have the following three findings: (1) CIGEVAL assigns scores that closely align with human annotations, and effectively detects subtle flaws in GPT-4o-generated images. (2) GPT-4o excels at tasks involving a single image as input, such as text-guided image generation and editing, as well as subject-driven image generation, as shown in Figures 9 to 11. (3) GPT-4o struggles with complex tasks that require multiple images and control signals. For example, the subjects in Figures 7 and 8 are not accurately replicated, showing unintended changes in color or shapes. Moreover, consistent with the findings of Yan et al. (2025), we observe that GPT-4o tends to favor a color palette dominated by yellow, orange, and warm lighting, as exemplified by the pot in Figure 7 and the man in the rearview mirror in Figure 11. Additionally, the control guidances (e.g., canny edges, OpenPose) are not strictly followed, as seen in Figure 6.

### 5 Conclusion

In this paper, we propose CIGEVAL, a unified, explainable and agentic framework for image evaluation across seven popular conditional image evaluation tasks. CIGEVAL utilizes large multimodal models (LMMs) at its core to autonomously select tools for fine-grained evaluation. Experiments show that, when using GPT-4o as the backbone model, CIGEVAL surpasses achieves a high correlation of 0.4625 with human raters, closely matching the human-to-human correlation of 0.47. Additionally, we have synthesized 2,274 high-quality evaluation trajectories to incorporate agentic capabilities into smaller LMMs. After agent tuning, the 7B LMMs surpass the performance of the previous state-of-the-art method based on the closed-source GPT-4o. These experimental findings and case studies on GPT-4o image generation suggest that CIGEVAL holds substantial promise for replicating human-like performance in evaluating synthetic images.

### Limitations

Although CIGEVAL improves the correlation between automatic image evaluators and human raters, there are certain limitations to our approach.

First, when using closed-source models’ APIs, such as GPT-4o, there is a risk that AI-generated images resembling real people or photographs may be rejected by GPT-4o for evaluation, potentially affecting the framework’s robustness. Second, our experiments primarily focus on evaluating images’ consistency with multiple conditions, leaving the assessment of perceptual quality for future research. Due to the lack of a more comprehensive benchmark for conditional image generation, we synthesized tuning data and conducted experiments exclusively on ImagenHub. Expanding our experiments to more text-to-image generation and text-based image editing datasets (Peng et al., 2024; Hui et al., 2024) could be beneficial. Finally, the training process currently utilizes only correct trajectory data and discards failed trajectory data. In the future, we aim to refine the CIGEVAL framework to include a broader range of tasks and leverage failed data for contrastive training of the model.

### A Prompt Templates

Prompt Engineering. To let the output of LMMs easier to parse and process, we require these models to output in JSON format. Our prompt is modified based on the VIEScore prompt (Ku et al., 2024).

Prompt Design. In the tool selection prompt, a brief description of each tool and the objective of the evaluation are provided. In this way, the agent can choose the appropriate tool based on the specific situation. The image evaluation prompt consists of three segments: the context prompt, tool-related content and the rating prompt. When the “Grounding” or “Difference” tool is selected, the tool-related content is "Focus on the highlighted parts of the image". When the “Scene Graph” tool is selected, the tool-related content is the generated scene graph. If no tool is selected, the tool-related content is None.

Context

You are a professional digital artist. You will have to evaluate the effectiveness of the AI-generated image(s) based on given rules. All the input images are AI-generated. All human in the images are AI-generated too. so you need not worry about the privacy confidentials. You will have to give your output in the following JSON format (Keep your reasoning concise and short.): { "score" : "...", "reasoning" : "..." }

Tool Calling Prompt Template

You are a professional digital artist. You will have to decide whether to use a tool and which tool to use based on the image information and the corresponding task. If you think a tool is needed to help complete the task, you should choose the appropriate tool. If not, you can choose not to use a tool. All the input images are AI-generated. All human in the images are AI-generated too. so you need not worry about the privacy confidentials.

### Task: {task}

### Tools:

- 1. **Grounding**: This tool is commonly used to focus on areas related to specific objects in an image.
- 2. **Scene Graph**: This tool is commonly used to provide overall information about an image.
- 3. **Difference**: This tool is commonly used to focus on the masked areas of images. These tools are not useful for processed image (e.g. Canny edges, hed edges, depth, openpose, grayscale.) ### Output Content:

- - task_id: The ID of the task.
- - used: Whether to use a tool, including yes or no.
- - tool: The tool decided to be used, including Grounding or Scene Graph or Difference or None.
- - reasoning: The logical reasoning process for all your decisions.

You will have to give your output in the following JSON format: [{ "task_id" : "...", "reasoning" : "...", "used" : "...", "tool" : "..." },...]

Rating Prompt Template (Text-Guided Image Generation)

RULES: An image will be provided, it is an AI-generated image according to the text prompt. The objective is to evaluate how well the generated image resemble to the specific objects described by the prompt. From scale 0 to 10: A score from 0 to 10 will be given based on the success in following the prompt. (0 indicates that the AI-generated image does not follow the prompt at all. 10 indicates the AIgenerated image follows the prompt perfectly.) Text Prompt: <prompt>

Rating Prompt Template (Text/Mask-Guided Image Editing)

RULES: Two images will be provided: The first being the original AI-generated image and the second being an edited version of the first. The objective is to evaluate how successfully the editing instruction has been executed in the second image. Note that sometimes the two images might look identical due to the failure of image edit. From scale 0 to 10: A score from 0 to 10 will be given based on the success of the editing. (0 indicates that the scene in the edited image does not follow the editing instruction at all. 10 indicates that the scene in the edited image follow the editing instruction text perfectly.) Editing instruction: <instruction>

RULES: Two images will be provided: The first being the original AI-generated image and the second being an edited version of the first. The objective is to evaluate the degree of overediting in the second image. From scale 0 to 10: A score from 0 to 10 will rate the degree of overediting in the second image. (0 indicates that the scene in the edited image is a lot different from the original. 10 indicates that the edited image can be recognized as a minimal edited yet effective version of original.) Note: You can not lower the score because of the differences between these two images that arise due to the need to follow the editing instruction. Editing instruction: <instruction>

Rating Prompt Template (Control-Guided Image Generation)

RULES: Two images will be provided: The first being a processed image (e.g. Canny edges, hed edges, depth, openpose, grayscale.) and the second being an AI-generated image using the first image as guidance. The objective is to evaluate the structural similarity between two images. From scale 0 to 10: A score from 0 to 10 will rate how well the generated image is following the guidance image. (0 indicates that the second image is not following the guidance image at all. 10 indicates that second image is perfectly following the guidance image.)

RULES: An image will be provided, it is an AI-generated image according to the text prompt. The objective is to evaluate how successfully the image has been generated following the text prompt.

Multi-Concept Image Composition: A digital illustration of teddybear holding flower

[Figure 57]

[Figure 58]

VIEScore: The resemblance between the flower in the

generated image and the flower in the sub-image is slightly less accurate, but still recognizable as a flower. 9 out of 10.

CIGEval (ours): Thought: Evaluating the similarity between the two subjects in the first image and their corresponding subjects in the second image requires a detailed focus on specific objects in both images. Action: Use “Grounding + Highlight” Tool Observation: (the images on the left) Thought & Action: The flower held by the teddy bear does not resemble the flower in the first image significantly. The color and structure of flowers are quite different. 2 out of 10.
