### Abstract

Think about how human handles complex reading tasks: marking key points, inferring their relationships, and structuring information to guide understanding and responses. Likewise, can a large language model benefit from text structure to enhance text-processing performance? To explore it, in this work, we first introduce Structure of Thought (SoT), a prompting technique that explicitly guides models to construct intermediate text structures, consistently boosting performance across eight tasks and three model families. Building upon this insight, we present T2SBench, the first benchmark designed to evaluate and improve text-to-structure capabilities of models. T2S-Bench includes 1.8K samples across 6 scientific domains and 32 structural types, rigorously constructed to ensure accuracy, fairness, and quality. Evaluation on 45 mainstream models reveals substantial improvement potential: the average accuracy on the multi-hop reasoning task is only 52.1%, and even the most advanced model achieves 58.1% node accuracy in end-to-end extraction. Furthermore, on Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, SoT alone yields an average +5.7% improvement across eight diverse text-processing tasks, and fine-tuning on T2S-Bench further increases this gain to +8.6%. These results highlight the value of explicit text structuring and the complementary contributions of SoT and T2S-Bench. Dataset and eval code have been released at here.

### 1. Introduction

With the rapid integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into real-world applications such as search engines (Liang et al., 2025; Xi et al., 2025), office productivity tools (Zheng et al., 2025; Li et al., 2023; Fu et al., 2022) and scientific writing (Zhang et al., 2025; Song et al.,

2025), high-quality text processing is evolving from merely demonstrating model capabilities into critical infrastructure directly impacting societal costs. Users increasingly depend on models to Find (identify evidence and relevant documents from massive datasets), Fuse (align and integrate viewpoints or facts from multiple sources), and Form (generate actionable conclusions, reports, decision-making evidence, or structured outputs). This ”Find–Fuse–Form” pipeline underpins everyday model-driven workflows.

However, despite the growing demand, current models still struggle with complex text processing, especially longcontext settings, even state-of-the-art model reach only around 60% on LongBench (Bai et al., 2024). One major reason is that nowadays models treat these tasks as end-to-end text generation, lacking stable intermediate representations (IR), resulting in unstable retrieval and uncontrollable generation. Recent advances have shown promise by introducing intermediate steps: for instance, highlight-guided generation first extracts sentence-level highlights from long texts as a content plan to enhance summarization and reporting quality (Du et al., 2025); similarly, SRAG (Lin et al., 2025) employs SQL-driven extraction modules to transform multidocument inputs into coherent relational tables, significantly improving multi-document QA tasks. However, these existing approaches are often task-specific and heavily reliant on input structures, thus failing to generalize effectively across diverse text tasks. Therefore, the core challenge remains: How to find a universal and reliable intermediate representation (IR), and use it to systematically evaluate and improve LLMs on general text-processing tasks?

To address this challenge, we first draw inspiration from how humans handle long textual information: When humans comprehend lengthy texts or perform text generation tasks, an effective approach to improve quality is to perform text structuring by extracting key elements and clearly defining their relationships. This structuring facilitates quick retrieval of relevant information, integration of multiple textual sources, and clearer communication to others. Based on this insight, we propose Structure of Thought (SoT),

- Figure 1. Performance of SoT and Importance of Text Structuring. We evaluated three models on eight distinct text-processing tasks using three prompting strategies: direct answering, Chain-of-Thought (CoT), and Structure of Thought (SoT). The horizontal axis shows the model’s performance with direct answering, while the vertical axis indicates the performance change relative to direct answering. Our evaluations follow standards from lm-eval and Longbench tasks. SoT consistently boosts performance across different tasks and models.

a general prompting strategy that instructs models to first structure the text into key nodes and links before generating final answers. As demonstrated in Fig. 1, SoT consistently and significantly improves model performance across eight mainstream text-processing tasks and three models, suggesting that text structure can serve as a universal intermediate representation (IR) to enhance various downstream tasks.

Building on this insight, we propose T2S-Bench, the first comprehensive dataset designed to evaluate and enhance models’ text structuring capabilities. T2S-Bench comprises a high-quality training set (T2S-Train-1.2k), a multi-hop reasoning evaluation set (T2S-Bench-MR with 500 samples), and an end-to-end structuring evaluation set (T2SBench-E2E with 87 samples). It covers six major scientific domains, 17 subfields, and 32 structure types, and offers several advantages: (i) High Structural Accuracy: By extracting text-structure pairs from rigorously vetted academic papers, T2S-Bench ensures structural correctness and reduces the inaccuracies associated with manual or model-based extraction. (ii) Universal and Fair Evaluation: T2S-Bench provides a broadly applicable evaluation suite across diverse text types. T2S-Bench-MR uses 4 structural question categories and 32 templates that require correct structuring to enable accurate multi-hop reasoning, while T2S-Bench-E2E reduces ambiguity from multiple valid structures by fixing key nodes and links and enforcing partial structural constraints for consistent, fair scoring. (iii) High Sample Quality: Constructing T2S-Bench involved over 6,000 model searches, six rounds of model validation, and three rounds of human quality checks spanning several months. Each sample was independently validated by at least two reviewers for structural, textual, and question accuracy.

We benchmarked 45 models from 10 families on T2S-Bench and found ample headroom: average exact match (EM) is only 52.1% on T2S-Bench-MR. End-to-end structuring, especially node extraction, remains challenging: even state-ofart Gemini2.5-Pro reaches just 58.1% accuracy. We further

perform model fine-tuning on T2S-Train-1.2k, boosting performance at most by 8.5% on average across eight downstream text processing tasks, showing that stronger structuring improves robustness and accuracy in downstream general text workflows. Overall, our contributions include:

- 1. Proposing Structure of Thought (SoT), a prompting strategy that structurizes texts before answering, consistently improving performance across diverse tasks.
- 2. Introducing T2S-Bench, the first comprehensive dataset evaluating and improving text structuring capabilities, featuring 1.8k high-quality samples covering extensive scientific domains and structural types.
- 3. Benchmarking 45 models using T2S-Bench, identifying substantial room for improvement. Our findings also demonstrate that fine-tuning models on T2STrain-1.2k significantly enhances downstream textprocessing performance, underscoring the critical value and practical benefits of structured text processing.

### 2. Motivation & Challenges

In this section, we explore and answer: Can explicitly structuring text improve a model’s general text-processing ability, and if so, by how much? We first probe the potential of text structuring by introducing SoT and evaluating its performance (Sect. 2.1). Then we summarize three core challenges in building text-to-structure dataset (Sect. 2.2).

#### 2.1. Structure of Thought

To explicitly leverage text structuring in general text processing, we introduce Structure of Thought (SoT), a universal prompting strategy. Specifically, SoT follows the format:

3) The benefit of structuring is both model- and taskagnostic. SoT consistently improves performance across all different model families and task types, suggesting that text structure can serve as a universal intermediate representation (IR) to enhance various downstream tasks.

Based on the provided text, identify the key nodes and links between them, and provide the structure. Then give your answer based on the text and structure.

Expected format: [Structure] { "nodes": [

In summary, similar to human cognition, models substantially benefit from structurized text information, leading to improved execution of downstream tasks. The benefits are significant and universally applicable, suggesting systematically assessing and enhancing models’ structurization capabilities is both crucial and urgently needed.

- {"id": "n2", "label": "Node2 Label"}],

{"source": "n1", "target": "n2"}]} [Answer] your answer

By forcing the model to extract key nodes and links, SoT encourages models to process long texts similarly to human reasoning: first structuring textual information, then performing content retrieval, aggregation, and generation. Compared to Chain of Thought (CoT), SoT provides clearer task instructions, offering models a more concrete objective. We evaluate three prompting strategies, including Direct Answer, CoT, and SoT, on eight widely used text-processing benchmarks using three different models. The results are shown in Fig. 1, which we can draw three key observations:

#### 2.2. Challenges in Dataset Construction

Although evaluating and training text structuring can substantially benefit models, building structures from text data faces three key challenges: (1) Difficult Correctness Verification: structuring long text is complex and timeconsuming for both humans and models, making correctness verification expensive and often ambiguous. (2) Complex Evaluation: Text structures can be nested, cyclic, or disconnected; while nodes and links capture basic forms, defining a single universal standard to score generated structures is inherently difficult. (3) One-to-Many Structural Mapping: A single text may admit multiple equally valid structures (e.g., minor node edits or merges), so evaluation against a single reference structure is typically infeasible.

- 1) Explicit text structuring substantially improves general text-related task performance. Across eight different tasks, SoT consistently delivers over 5% performance improvement. Notably, on 2WikiMultiHopQA and MuSiQue, SoT improves performance by over 10%.
- 2) SoT is more effective than CoT for text processing. While CoT is highly beneficial for domains like math and coding, it is not reliably helpful for general text tasks due to potential noise. In contrast, SoT anchors reasoning to an explicit structure, leading to more consistent improvements.

These challenges help explain why text structuring datasets remain scarce. In this work, we address all three challenges through carefully designed construction pipeline and introduce T2S-Bench. As summarized in Tab. 3, T2S-Bench is the first dataset to comprehensively evaluate models’ text

### 3. Construction Process of T2S-Bench

In this section, we introduce construction process of T2SBench. The overall construction flow is shown in Fig. 2. All prompts used are detailed in Appendix C.

#### 3.1. Sample Collection

Academic Paper-Based Data Source. To address the challenge of verifying structural correctness, T2S-Bench utilizes academic papers and their structural diagrams as primary data sources. Academic papers offer two significant advantages: (1) High Structural Accuracy: Diagrams in academic papers are meticulously designed by authors and rigorously validated by reviewers, especially for well-cited articles, ensuring their structural accuracy and completeness. (2) Strong Textual Structure: Text segments corresponding to diagrams in academic papers inherently possess high structural coherence and logical clarity, allowing readers to infer diagrammatic relationships directly from the text.

By leveraging the professionalism and correctness inherent in academic paper diagrams and the structural clarity of corresponding texts, T2S-Bench averts hallucinations from model-generated structures and significantly reduces human verification efforts. Hence, our initial goal is to collect high-quality text-structure pairs from academic paper.

Science Topic & Structure Type Design. To ensure dataset diversity, as detailed in Tab. 1, T2S-Bench includes 6 main scientific disciplines (Computer Science, Life Sciences, So-

cial Sciences, Environmental Sciences, Economics & Management Sciences, Physical Sciences), 17 sub-disciplines, and 32 structural types. These structural types represent commonly used diagrams within specific sub-disciplines.

Model Search & Check. To effectively generate valid paper-structure pairs, we implement a rigorous four-module automated pipeline: (i) Paper Search: We leverage GPT5.2’s (Singh et al., 2025) search capability to identify papers containing structural diagrams. To improve precision and figure quality, each search is constrained to a specific subfield and structure type. (ii) PDF Download & Figure Cropping: Selected papers are automatically downloaded using Python scripts. Figures are extracted via pdffigures2 (Clark & Divvala, 2016), and validated by GPT-4o (OpenAI et al., 2024) to confirm structural relevance. (iii) Structural Validity Check: Cropped figures undergo validity checks using Gemini-2.5-Pro (Comanici et al., 2025), ensuring diagrams can be represented as JSON structures containing nodes and links. (iv) Text Extraction & Validity Check: Verified figures and PDFs are cross-checked by GPT-o3 and Gemini-2.5Pro to ensure at least three text segments correspond clearly with each structural diagram, generating coherent textual samples with clearly identified start and end sentences.

Failure at any stage triggers a restart from step (i), with only fully validated samples included. We target 50 highquality samples per structural type; ultimately, 1521 qualified text-structure pairs were obtained after approximately five searches per accepted sample.

First-Round Human Filter. Despite model verification, diverse presentation formats in academic diagrams often introduce significant noise (e.g., images, explanatory text,

symbols). Therefore, we invited 11 PhD-level experts from various domains to perform manual quality checks on samples relevant to their respective fields. Each expert followed a checklist assessing structural completeness, noise presence, node and link counts, and structural singularity. The complete checklist is provided in Appendix C.4. Only samples meeting all checklist criteria were labeled as highquality. The human review took one week and resulted in 672 rigorously vetted, high-quality text-structure pairs, forming the basis of our benchmark dataset.

#### 3.2. T2S Multi-hop Reasoning Dataset Construction

After collecting high-quality text–structure pairs, we construct the T2S Multi-hop Reasoning dataset. To overcome the challenge of evaluating text structuring, we use multiplechoice questions grounded in paper reference diagrams that require multi-node, multi-step reasoning. Each question must (1) Necessitate text structuring and multi-step reasoning; (2) Explicitly depend on the reference diagram; and (3)

Be answerable solely from the text. Based on these criteria, we build the dataset in follow stages.

Question Template Design. As shown in Tab. 2, we developed four primary question categories including Fault Localization, Functional Mapping, Boundary Testing, and Counterfactual Reasoning, and designed eight question templates for each category (templates detail provided in Appendix B). Each template is carefully crafted to make a structure-aware interpretation necessary for solving the problem.

Question Generation & Model Verification. To generate suitable multi-hop questions, we implemented a three-step process: (i) Template-based Multi-hop Question Generation: Using GPT-o3, questions were generated based on provided texts and structural diagrams. Each question adhered strictly to one of the predefined templates, requiring reasoning involving at least two nodes to ensure sufficient complexity. (ii) Correctness Verification: Generated questions and their answers were cross-validated against reference diagrams using GPT-5.2 and Gemini-2.5-Pro, ensuring logical con-

sistency. (iii) Text Dependency Verification: Questions and answers were assessed to confirm they could be inferred directly from the text alone, using GPT-5.2 and Gemini-2.5Pro models. If any check failed at steps (ii) or (iii), question generation was repeated from step (i). We aimed to generate four questions per text-structure pair (one per category) with a maximum of three generation attempts per question. Eventually, 2,150 valid samples were collected.

Second-Round Human Filter. For further verification, a manual validation of questions and answers was conducted by 15 PhD-level experts across relevant domains. Reviewers evaluated each item based on the correctness, difficulty, coherence and format of the question (the full checklist is provided in Appendix C.4). Only samples passing all checks were included. This comprehensive human filtering process spanned two weeks, ultimately yielding approximately 1.7k high-quality text-structure-question triples.

Finally, we perform a stratified 7:3 split by domain, producing T2S-Train-1.2k (training) and T2S-Bench-MR (test, 500 samples). During evaluation, only texts and questions were provided to models, with Exact Match (EM) and F1 scores used as evaluation metrics.

#### 3.3. T2S-Bench-E2E Dataset Construction

To evaluate models’ end-to-end text-to-structure extraction, we build T2S-Bench-E2E. As mentioned in Section 2.3 (Challenge 3), E2E evaluation is inherently hard because a single text may admit multiple valid structures. To ensure fair and comparable scoring, we follow three principles to construct sample in E2E task: (1) Focus on key nodes and links that reflect the text’s core content while filtering noise, (2) Control graph complexity to avoid both trivial and overly ambiguous cases, and (3) Partially constrain structure generation so models are evaluated on the remaining elements rather than unconstrained free-form graphs. Following these principles, T2S-Bench-E2E was developed in follow steps.

Key Structure Extraction & Model Check. To obtain

key structural frames, we: (i) Transformed high-quality diagrams from Section 3.1 into JSON format using GPT-o3, clearly defining nodes and links. (ii) Generated key structures by removing irrelevant nodes and links via GPT-o3, resulting in concise Text-KeyStructure pairs. (iii) Conducted rigorous model checks using GPT-5.2 and Gemini-2.5-Pro to verify logical coherence, text dependency, and consistency with reference diagrams. Samples failing this check were discarded to ensure dataset quality.

Third-Round Human Filter. Finally, five PhD students independently verified each Text-KeyStructure pair by inferring structures from texts and ensuring substantial alignment with provided key structures. Samples with significant deviations or excessive complexity were excluded. After approximately two weeks of rigorous quality control, 87 high-quality Text-KeyStructure pairs were finalized.

Partial Structure-Constrained Evaluation. To facilitate fair assessments and limit evaluation complexity, nodes and links were evaluated separately in T2S-Bench-E2E:

- 1. Link Evaluation: Models received text and all node information (”nodes”: [”id”: ”n1”, ”label”: ”Node Text”]) and predicted links in JSON format. Link correctness was measured using F1 scores.
- 2. Node Evaluation: Models were given text and all existing links (”links”: [”source”: ”n1”, ”target”: ”n2”, ”label”: ”Link Text” ]), predicting corresponding nodes. Node evaluation was based on average semantic similarity between predicted nodes and ground truth.

This partial structural constraint evaluation method standardizes outputs for fair, accurate assessments, effectively isolating and measuring node and link extraction abilities.

- 3.4. Data Distribution Statistics

T2S-Bench is balanced by design: we aim for 50 samples per structure type, and we create four questions per sample

- Table 4. Overall performance on T2S-Bench. The leftmost two columns show overall performance (EM and F1 scores) on T2SBench-MR, multiple-choice dataset requiring multi-hop reasoning. The central columns represent accuracy for each question type within T2S-Bench-MR. The rightmost two columns show performance on the T2S-Bench-E2E dataset, separately evaluating node extraction (measured by average semantic similarity between predicted and reference nodes) and link extraction (measured by F1 score of correctly identified link pairs). The best-performing model within each model family on T2S-Bench-MR is highlighted with pink shading. Additionally, the top three performances in each metric are highlighted in red (first place), green (second place), and blue (third place).

(one per question family). After model and human filtering, counts vary slightly across types (Fig. 3). The dataset is also well balanced across domains: Computer Science is the largest (27.5%) due to more open-access papers and higherquality text–structure yield, while Environment Science still contributes 11%, demonstrating broad coverage.

### 4. Evaluation

In this section, we comprehensively report the performance of mainstream models on T2S-Bench and demonstrate the

effectiveness of T2S-Train-1.2k. Detailed experimental settings are provided in Appendix F.1, and more extensive results and insights are included in Appendix F.2 and F.3.

#### 4.1. General Performance on T2S-Bench

Overall Results. Tab. 4 compares the performance of 45 mainstream language models on the T2S-Bench benchmark, reporting the results both on T2S-Bench-MR and T2SBench-E2E. Several high-level trends emerge. First, proprietary giants continue to dominate: Gemini-2.5-Pro tops

- Figure 4. F1 scores across different topics on T2S-Bench-MR. We selected one representative model from each model family; The first fig shows their average F1 scores across various domains. The remains fig illustrate individual model performances per domain, with the vertical axis indicating deviations from the average performance. The dark dashed rectangle represents the average performance (set to zero). Scores outside this rectangle indicate above-average performance, while scores inside indicate below-average performance..

the table with 81.40% EM and 91.56% F1, followed closely by Claude-sonnet (76.80/86.85) and GPT-5.2 (71.80/84.32). Second, instruction-tuned open-source models are rapidly closing the gap. Variants of Qwen3 and DeepSeek achieve overall EM in the 60%–70% range, illustrating that careful curation of training data and prompting can deliver competitive reasoning ability without proprietary resources. Third, older or smaller architectures such as GLM-4.5, GLM-4.6 and MiniMax-M2 languish below 40% EM, underscoring the importance of both model capacity and high-quality instruction fine-tuning for successful multi-hop reasoning.

Task Breakdown. The granular breakdown reveals clear patterns: Boundary testing and counterfactual reasoning tend to be the easiest for strong models: top-tier systems like Gemini-2.5-Pro, Claude-sonnet and GPT-5.2 achieve above 80% EM on these categories. By contrast, fault localization consistently drags down performance. Even among the leaders, there is a 15%–20% drop between counterfactual reasoning and fault localization, reflecting the difficulty of tracing

causal chains within complex graphs. Functional mapping sits between the extremes: high-performing models solve most functional mapping questions, whereas weaker models like MiniMax-M2, GLM-4.6 and LLaMA-3.2-3B answer fewer than 10% correctly. Overall, the per-category results highlight that T2S-Bench exercises a broad spectrum of reasoning skills and that models must handle a variety of inference types to succeed.

Structure Extraction. Results on T2S-Bench-E2E in the last two columns of Tab.4 reveal that structure extraction remains a major bottleneck for all models. Across the board, Node similarity rarely exceeds 60%: only Gemini-2.5-Pro and a handful of Claude models surpass the 55%. Most open-source and mid-sized models cluster between 35% and 50%, and the smallest baselines (GLM-4.5, MiniMax-M2, LLaMA-3.2-3B) fall below 35%. In contrast, Link F1 scores are uniformly higher, with leading models achieving 84%–87% and even weaker models often exceeding 70%. This disparity implies that identifying the correct set

of nodes is far harder than linking them once found. Since the Node score limits the potential Link score, continued advances in entity detection, co-reference resolution, and discourse segmentation will be essential for closing the gap.

Fig.4 visualises domain-wise performance for selected models using radar charts. Each axis corresponds to a science domain, and values represent the deviation from the mean score. These plots illustrate that proprietary models maintain balanced performance across domains, whereas open-source models exhibit larger fluctuations. For example, the Kimi-K2 model excels in environmental science but underperforms in physics, while MiniMax-Text-01 struggles across all domains. The radar charts emphasise that T2S-Bench requires broad, domain-general reasoning skills.

4.2. The Importance of Structure for Downstream Tasks To evaluate whether improved structuring skills translate to better downstream task, we perform ablation experiments on Qwen2.5-7B and LLaMA-3.1-8B. Tab.5 summarises the effect of different prompting strategies—vanilla, CoT, SoT and T2S training—on T2S-Bench and on long-context tasks from LongBench and Scrolls. SoT consistently yields larger gains than CoT, and fine-tuning on T2S-Bench further boosts both in-domain and out-of-domain performance. For example, Qwen2.5-7B’s EM improves from 28.8% to 46.1% on T2S-Bench and from 60.0% to 68.2% on HotpotQA, while LLaMA-3.1-8B’s EM increases from 24.2% to 38.1% on T2S-Bench and 59.1% to 69.2% on HotpotQA. These results demonstrate that structuring skills learned on T2S-Bench generalise to real-world long-context tasks.

Correlation analysis. Fig.6 plots T2S-Bench-MR EM against LongBench Pro scores for a variety of models. A clear positive correlation emerges: models that perform well on T2S-Bench also achieve high scores on LongBench. For example, Gemini-2.5-Pro, Claude sonnet and DeepSeek-R1 occupy the upper right region of the plot, whereas weak

models like LLaMA-3.2-3B and MiniMax-M2 reside in the lower left. This relationship suggests that multi-hop reasoning and structuring skills are indicative of general long-context reasoning ability, reinforcing the value of structural thinking for downstream applications.

#### 4.3. Analysis Experiments

To investigate how structure complexity affects model performance, we partition T2S-Bench-E2E by the number of nodes in the reference graph. Fig.5 shows the heatmap of LinkF1 scores across complexity bins for several models. As the number of nodes increases from 1–5 to 14–20, performance declines sharply. Models like DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen3-235B remain robust up to 10–14 nodes but degrade beyond that, while smaller models (e.g., LLaMA-3.1-8B) collapse to near-zero when faced with more than 14 nodes. These results highlight that current models struggle to maintain accuracy as structural complexity increases, motivating future work on scalable structuring algorithms. In summary, our evaluation demonstrates that T2S-Bench provides a challenging testbed for assessing both reasoning and structuring capabilities of large models. The benchmark exposes significant performance gaps across domains and reasoning categories, emphasises the importance of explicit structure extraction, and shows that structuring skills transfer to downstream tasks. We hope that T2S-Bench will spur further research into structure-aware training and inference for long-context language understanding.

### 5. Conclusion

In this study, we introduce T2S-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark evaluating and improving text-to-structure capabilities. Derived from scientific literature, T2S-Bench spans six scientific domains and 32 structural types, employing carefully designed multi-hop reasoning (MR) evaluations and partially constrained end-to-end (E2E) extraction

evaluation. Benchmarking 45 mainstream models highlights significant improvement potential, notably in node extraction. Our fine-tuning experiments further show that enhanced structuring skills effectively transfer to downstream tasks. In summary, our results underscore structuring as a fundamental competence for reliable text understanding, encouraging future research in text structuring.

### Impact Statement

Potential positive impacts. This paper contributes methods and resources for improving models’ ability to convert long text into explicit intermediate structures. If adopted responsibly, SoT-style structuring and T2S-Bench-style evaluation may improve reliability in document-centric applications such as literature review, evidence-grounded question answering, and structured report generation. Intermediate structures can also increase auditability: users and developers can inspect nodes/links to verify what information the model relied on, potentially reducing hallucinations and making failures easier to diagnose.

Potential negative impacts and dual use. Stronger textto-structure capability can also enable misuse. In particular, it may facilitate large-scale extraction of entities and relations from sensitive or proprietary documents, supporting surveillance, profiling, or targeted manipulation. Moreover, text structure can be repurposed to organize misleading narratives or generate persuasive but incorrect “structured” reports that appear authoritative. Finally, training and evaluating many large models can incur non-trivial computational and environmental costs.

Mitigations and responsible use. Our benchmark is grounded in publicly available scientific writing, which reduces the likelihood of containing personal data; nevertheless, we encourage future users to apply appropriate privacy safeguards when deploying structuring techniques on private corpora (e.g., access control, data minimization, and redaction). We also recommend human-in-the-loop verification for high-stakes settings: the produced structure should be treated as an inspectable hypothesis rather than a guaranteed faithful representation. For dataset release and downstream usage, practitioners should respect copyright/licensing constraints of source materials and follow venue policies on research ethics and data usage.

In summary, we believe the primary expected impact of this work is to provide a unified paradigm and benchmark for structure-aware text processing that improves robustness and transparency, while acknowledging the dual-use risks inherent to stronger information extraction and recommending safeguards for responsible deployment.

### A. Background

Text-processing benchmarks. Recent evaluations oriented toward real-world text workflows can generally be categorized into three types: Find, Fuse, and Form. Find-type datasets, such as MultiFieldQA (Bai et al., 2024) and Qasper (Dasigi et al., 2021), focus on locating specific information within lengthy or specialized documents. Fuse-type datasets, including HotpotQA (Yang et al., 2018), 2WikiMultiHopQA (Ho et al., 2020), and Musique (Trivedi et al., 2022), emphasize integrating and reasoning across multiple paragraphs or documents. Form-type datasets, exemplified by Qmsum (Zhong et al., 2021) and GovReport (Huang et al., 2021), require generating specific outputs after reading texts. Although these benchmarks reflect realistic text-processing scenarios, tasks are commonly modeled as end-to-end ”direct generation,” lacking a unified, stable, and verifiable intermediate representation (IR). This limitation results in unstable evidence retrieval, difficult-to-control integration across evidence, and less-auditable generation outcomes.

Information structuring. Indeed, prior research has demonstrated that introducing structured information or structured intermediate representations can significantly enhance model stability and performance in specific text-processing or reasoning tasks. For instance, Structure Guided Prompt (Cheng et al., 2024) explicitly converts unstructured texts into graph structures, guiding models through graph-based multi-step reasoning and improving multi-step inference capabilities in zero-shot scenarios. Similarly, PDFTriage (Saad-Falcon et al., 2024) targets structured documents (e.g., PDFs with chapters, tables, and layouts), emphasizing retrieval and question-answering guided by structural or content clues. However, these methods have primarily shown effectiveness in specific tasks or structural types, with inconsistent structural definitions and

evaluation protocols, leaving a gap for a comprehensive evaluation framework covering a broader range of text types and structural forms.

Chain-of-Thought (CoT). CoT prompting (Wei et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2025b) showed that LLMs can be steered to produce a sequence of intermediate reasoning steps, which often improves performance on hard reasoning tasks by making the inference path explicit, and has been shown to be more effective than traditional acceleration approaches (Wang et al., 2024; Kuo et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2025c) that rely on model-level modifications such as compression (Wang* et al., 2025; 2023; Wang & Zhang, 2023), quantization, or system-level optimizations (Ye et al., 2025; Shao et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2025a). Follow-up work improved CoT’s reliability by sampling multiple reasoning paths and aggregating them, e.g., self-consistency selects the most consistent answer across diverse chains rather than trusting a single greedy trace. More recent lines of work treat inference as structured search over intermediate states: Tree-of-Thoughts (Yao et al., 2023) explores and evaluates multiple candidate “thought” states with lookahead and backtracking, and Graph-of-Thoughts (GoT) (Besta et al., 2024) further generalizes this to an arbitrary graph, enabling operations like merging partial solutions and using feedback loops via an explicit execution graph (generate/score/aggregate/transform) over nodes. Importantly, these paradigms primarily structure the model’s reasoning process—their nodes represent solution states and edges represent dependencies among them—whereas Structure of Thought (SoT) (as you define it) structures the input text content into a graph of salient nodes and typed links to serve as a stable, task-agnostic intermediate representation for downstream text processing; thus, SoT is largely orthogonal to CoT/GoT and composable with them (e.g., GoT can search over multiple candidate SoT structures, while SoT can ground CoT/GoT reasoning in explicit evidence structure).

### B. Task Description and Examples

In this section, we provide a detailed guide to our task taxonomy. As shown in Tab. 2, we organize the questions into four categories: Fault Localization, Functional Mapping, Boundary Testing, and Counterfactual Reasoning. We then present representative question examples for each category to illustrate how benchmark items are written and formatted in practice. Each example is shown in the same boxed layout, including the question prompt, options when applicable, the reference answer, and a short rationale. These examples serve as a reference to understand the style and structure of the benchmark questions.

#### B.1. Fault Localization Task Examples

Fault Localization focuses on pinpointing the minimal text span(s) that cause an error, inconsistency, or wrong output, such as the specific sentence/claim that breaks correctness. Its key characteristic is fine-grained evidence attribution: models must localize where the fault is and often distinguish true evidence from distractors or near-miss statements.

[FL1] UPSTREAM ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFICATION

• Task: Given an observed failure at a node, identify which upstream components could plausibly be the root cause by tracing dependency paths backward from the anomaly.

#### FL1 Example

Question If recent samples suddenly stop appearing in the Leaves of a zone, which of the following components could plausibly be the upstream root cause of that data loss (select all that apply)?

###### Options

- • A) Leaf Routers
- • B) Ingestion Routers
- • C) Range Assigner
- • D) Root Mixers

Answer A, B, C

Reasoning

Data reach the Leaves through the ingestion path: Ingestion Routers forward records to Leaf Routers, which write them into the Leaves. The Range Assigner controls how data are mapped onto Leaves. Failures in any of these can prevent samples from being stored. Root Mixers only issue queries downstream of the Leaves and cannot cause missing stored samples.

[FL2] DOWNSTREAM PROPAGATION ORDERING

• Task: If a component is removed or fails, identify which downstream node will be affected at a specific position in the propagation chain by following the directed edges and counting hops.

#### FL2 Example

Question Suppose strict treatment compliance eliminates the Non-adherence node from the causal pathway. Which component becomes the second downstream element to reflect this change after the initial effect on prolonged hyperglycemia?

###### Options

- • A) Prolonged upward-arrow[glucose]
- • B) Beta islet failure
- • C) Ketosis
- • D) T2DM + prior ketosis

Answer B

Reasoning Removing Non-adherence first prevents prolonged hyperglycemia as the immediate downstream effect. The next node in the chain is beta islet failure, reached after two hops, making it the second downstream element. Ketosis is one step further downstream, while T2DM + prior ketosis lies upstream and is unaffected.

[FL3] MINIMAL CUT SET IDENTIFICATION

• Task: Identify the smallest set or sets of nodes whose removal blocks all directed paths from a source to a target, ensuring no causal influence can pass through any remaining branch.

#### FL3 Example

Question To guarantee that a change in the Keyrate can no longer affect Inflation through any of the model’s three transmission channels, which of the following triplets of variables form approximately minimal cut sets (select all that apply)?

###### Options

- • A) Real rate + Exchange rate + Inflation expectations
- • B) Exchange rate + Output gap + Inflation expectations
- • C) Real rate + Output gap + Exchange rate
- • D) Real rate + Output gap + Inflation expectations

Answer A, B

Reasoning

All influence from Keyrate reaches Inflation via three independent branches: (i) through Real rate, (ii) through Exchange rate, and (iii) through Inflation expectations. Option A removes one pivotal node from each branch. Option B blocks both shortcut branches and also breaks remaining longer chains by cutting Output gap. Options C and D each leave at least one shortcut path intact.

[FL4] SINGLE BOTTLENECK OR MANDATORY PATH IDENTIFICATION

• Task: Identify the unique component that lies on every path between request sources and the target node, making it a mandatory bottleneck that all flows must traverse.

#### FL4 Example

Question Every write request, whether it originates in the master region or in a remote slave region, must traverse a particular component before the data can be recorded in any database. Which component acts as this mandatory bottleneck in the write path?

###### Options

- • A) Master DB
- • B) Leader Cache in the master region
- • C) Leader Cache in the slave region
- • D) Replication stream from the Master DB to the Slave DB Answer

B Reasoning Local writes go through the master region leader cache before reaching the Master DB. Remote writes are first forwarded from the slave region leader cache to the same master region leader cache and only then committed. Therefore, the master region leader cache lies on every write path and is the mandatory bottleneck.

[FL5] PARTIAL FAILURE WITH COMPENSATION

• Task: When one expected intermediate outcome is missing but a related final outcome still holds, identify which upstream components in the failing branch could explain the observed pattern while allowing other branches to compensate.

#### FL5 Example

Question Monitoring shows that consumers are not decreasing their consumption of the targeted foods, yet the population’s overall diet quality is still improving. Which of the following upstream components could most plausibly account for this pattern (select all that apply)?

###### Options

- • A) Taxes for food and beverages
- • B) Target foods become relatively more expensive for consumers
- • C) Target foods become relatively less expensive for consumers
- • D) Consumers increase consumption of target foods

Answer A, B

Reasoning

A failure in the tax pathway, either the tax itself or its immediate price increase effect, can prevent the decrease in consumption signal. Meanwhile, other pathways can still contribute to improved overall diet quality, allowing the final outcome to appear normal. Nodes in the subsidy branch do not explain the missing decrease consumption outcome.

[FL6] INDEPENDENT BRANCH IDENTIFICATION

• Task: If one edge fails, identify which other relation remains unaffected because it lies on an independent branch that does not rely on the failed dependency.

#### FL6 Example

Question If the switching: power adaption message sent by the DSO never reaches the EVSE owner, which of the following relations will remain unaffected because it belongs to an independent branch?

###### Options

- • A) Flexibility transfer from the EVSE owner to the DSO
- • B) Compensation payment from the energy supplier to the EVSE owner
- • C) Flexibility-potential information from the EVSE owner to the DSO
- • D) The switching: power adaption link itself

Answer B

Reasoning The failure lies on the control path DSO → EVSE owner. The monetary path energy supplier → EVSE owner (compensation payment) bypasses the DSO entirely, so it is independent of the disrupted control branch and remains unaffected.

[FL7] FEEDBACK LOOP MALFUNCTION DIAGNOSIS

• Task: Given an observed symptom of inefficient or degraded system behavior, identify which component in a feedback or control loop is most likely malfunctioning by reasoning about how the loop maintains system performance.

#### FL7 Example

Question In the described coverage guided fuzzing process, if the system is observed to be repeatedly testing the same code paths without discovering new vulnerabilities, this suggests a failure in the exploration strategy. Which part of the process is most likely malfunctioning to cause this specific inefficiency?

###### Options

- • A) The module responsible for mutating inputs.
- • B) The mechanism that executes a single test case against the target application.
- • C) The feedback loop that analyzes code coverage to guide input selection.
- • D) The component responsible for detecting and logging crashes.

Answer C

Reasoning

Coverage guided fuzzing continuously monitors and analyzes code coverage, then prioritizes inputs that lead to unexplored or less covered code paths. If this feedback mechanism fails, the system stops prioritizing new paths and repeatedly tests the same known paths, causing the observed inefficiency. Mutation issues would reduce input diversity but do not necessarily cause repeated path selection, execution failure would stop testing entirely, and crash detection failure would miss vulnerabilities but would not prevent exploration.

[FL8] COMMON ANCESTOR OF MULTIPLE OUTPUTS

• Task: Given multiple output nodes with simultaneous anomalies, identify upstream components that could serve as a single common cause by having directed paths to all anomalous outputs.

#### FL8 Example

Question Both the mass balance of the Greenland ice sheet and the sea-level contribution from thermal expansion are observed to shift unexpectedly. Which of the following components could serve as a single common upstream cause for both of these anomalies (select all that apply)?

###### Options

- • A) Upper-ocean temperature anomaly
- • B) Deeper-ocean temperature anomaly
- • C) Anthropogenic CO2 emissions
- • D) SO2 injections

Answer A, C, D

Reasoning

Upper-ocean temperature anomalies directly drive both Greenland melting and thermal expansion. Anthropogenic CO2 emissions influence atmospheric CO2, which raises upper-ocean temperatures, giving a shared upstream path to both outputs. SO2 injections also feed the climate sub-model by altering upper-ocean temperatures, affecting both outputs. Deeper-ocean temperature anomaly only feeds the thermal expansion branch and has no path to Greenland.

#### B.2. Functional Mapping Task Examples

Functional Mapping asks models to map pieces of text to explicit functions/roles in a structured workflow, e.g., linking a requirement to the responsible component, step, or API, or mapping an observation to the operation that should handle it. It emphasizes role alignment and relationship grounding: correct answers require consistent many-to-many linking between textual units and predefined function slots.

[FM1] ALTERNATIVE IMPLEMENTATIONS IDENTIFICATION

• Task: Identify which functional stage has multiple alternative tool or component implementations available.

#### FM1 Example

Question Paper: DATC RDF 2019: Towards a Complete Academic Reference Design Flow Topology: EDA Toolchain and Design Flow Diagram In the described RDF 2019 flow, several stages are enhanced with specific tool integrations. For which of the following functions does the flow provide multiple alternative tool implementations, thereby implying that a selection between them is necessary? Options

- • A) Floorplan
- • B) Detailed Placement
- • C) Gate Sizing
- • D) Clock Tree Synthesis

Answer C

Reasoning The flow lists multiple tools for Gate Sizing, namely Resizer and TritonSizer, which implies an explicit choice. The other functions are each associated with a single named tool in the description, so they do not indicate alternative implementations.

[FM2] AGGREGATION POINT IDENTIFICATION

• Task: Identify the node that serves as a central aggregation point collecting inputs from multiple sources.

#### FM2 Example

Question Paper: The Hadoop Distributed File System Topology: Storage or Networked System After the client pipelines data through several DataNodes, every DataNode sends a “Blocks Received” acknowledgment upstream. Which single component serves as the central aggregation point for all of these acknowledgments? Options

- • A) HDFS Client
- • B) NameNode
- • C) First DataNode in the pipeline
- • D) Last DataNode in the pipeline

Answer B

Reasoning Each DataNode independently reports its received blocks status to the NameNode. Since multiple acknowledgments converge to the same node, the NameNode is the aggregator.

[FM3] INTERMEDIATE BUFFER OR STORAGE IDENTIFICATION

• Task: Identify components that act as intermediate storage or buffers between two stages of processing.

#### FM3 Example

Question Paper: AccelTran: A Sparsity Aware Accelerator for Dynamic Inference Topology: Accelerator and Microarchitecture Block Diagram Which of the following components act as the on chip storage buffers that sit between the DMA controller fetches and the Processing Elements computations? Select all that apply. Options

- • A) Weight Buffer
- • B) Control Block
- • C) Mask Buffer
- • D) Activation Buffer

Answer A, C, D

Reasoning The DMA brings weights, activations, and masks onto the chip, and these are held in the corresponding Weight Buffer, Activation Buffer, and Mask Buffer before being consumed by the Processing Elements. The Control Block schedules and coordinates, but it does not provide data storage between stages.

[FM4] CONTROLLER OR CONSTRAINT ROLE IDENTIFICATION

• Task: Identify which components primarily constrain or govern other components rather than directly producing outputs or allocating resources.

#### FM4 Example

Question Paper: The Governance and Implementation of the National Action Plan on AMR Topology: Institutional and Governance Framework Diagram Within the antimicrobial resistance governance framework, which governance areas mainly act as controllers, shaping or constraining the activities of other areas rather than directly delivering interventions or funds? Select all that apply. Options

- • A) Sustainability
- • B) Policy Design
- • C) Monitoring and Evaluation
- • D) One Health Engagement

Answer B, D

Reasoning

Policy Design sets rules, strategy, and coordination mechanisms that guide how other areas operate. One Health Engagement is positioned as a cross cutting influence that shapes multiple other governance areas. Sustainability is primarily about resources, while Monitoring and Evaluation primarily measures performance rather than constraining activities as the main role.

[FM5] MEDIATOR OR CONDUIT IDENTIFICATION

• Task: Identify the node that serves as the main conduit through which one component influence reaches another.

#### FM5 Example

Question Paper: Leaning against the Wind Policies on Vietnam Economy with DSGE Model Topology: DSGE Sector and Agent Interaction Schematic Which agent serves as the main conduit through which lending by Banks ultimately influences Capital good producers? Options

- • A) Households
- • B) Retailers
- • C) Entrepreneurs
- • D) Capital good producers

Answer C

Reasoning Banks lend to Entrepreneurs, and Entrepreneurs use those funds to purchase capital from Capital good producers. That path makes Entrepreneurs the mediating node that transmits the effect of bank lending to the producers.

[FM6] MONITORING OR EVALUATION METRIC IDENTIFICATION

• Task: Identify which element functions primarily as a monitoring or assessment metric within the system flow.

#### FM6 Example

Question Paper: The Utility of Combining the IAD and SES Frameworks Topology: Institutional and Governance Framework Diagram Which element in the IAD framework functions primarily as a monitoring or assessment metric, receiving the results of interactions and channeling feedback without itself directly generating new actions or outcomes? Options

- • A) Action situation
- • B) Interactions
- • C) Evaluative criteria
- • D) Outcomes

###### Answer C

Reasoning Outcomes feed into Evaluative criteria, where results are judged, and those evaluations then feed back into contextual factors. This role is measurement and assessment rather than direct action generation or outcome production.

[FM7] PARALLEL COMPLEMENTARY SUB FUNCTIONS IDENTIFICATION

• Task: Identify nodes that act as parallel complementary sub functions feeding directly into a target outcome.

#### FM7 Example

Question Paper: Digital Public Infrastructure and Development: A World Bank Approach Topology: Logic Model and Theory of Change Diagram In the causal structure, which of the following nodes act as parallel complementary sub functions that directly channel their influence into the “Financial Inclusion” outcome, rather than acting as upstream precursors or downstream results? Select all that apply. Options

- • A) More competition among DFS providers
- • B) Digital and financial literacy
- • C) Participation in the digital economy
- • D) Catalyze demand for DFS by individuals and MSMEs

Answer B, D

Reasoning

Both Digital and financial literacy and Catalyze demand for DFS by individuals and MSMEs connect directly into Financial Inclusion as separate incoming branches, making them parallel contributors. More competition among DFS providers sits one step upstream, acting through the catalyze demand node, while Participation in the digital economy appears as a downstream consequence rather than a direct input to Financial Inclusion.

#### B.3. Boundary Testing Task Examples

Boundary Testing targets edge cases and threshold conditions in natural-language specifications, such as identifying when a rule applies, when it fails, and what inputs sit just inside/outside valid ranges. Its hallmark is precision around constraints: subtle wording, numeric ranges, exceptions, and conditional logic matter, and small changes can flip the correct outcome.

- [BT1] FEEDBACK LINK ELIMINATION

• Task: Determine which specific feedback or regulatory link would be eliminated if a key intermediate component is removed.

#### BT1 Example

Question Paper: Inclusion of the glucocorticoid receptor in a hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis model reveals bistability Topology: Physiological Pathway / Axis Network In the HPA axis network, cortisol (O) inhibits downstream hormones only after binding to the glucocorticoid receptor (R). If R is completely absent so that the OR complex cannot form, which specific negative feedback link would be eliminated? Options

- • A) Inhibition of CRH (C) synthesis in the hypothalamus by cortisol (O)
- • B) Inhibition of ACTH (A) production in the pituitary by cortisol (O)
- • C) Up regulation of glucocorticoid receptor (R) synthesis driven by OR complex
- • D) Activation of cortisol (O) release from the adrenal by ACTH (A)

Answer B

Reasoning Cortisol must bind R to form the OR complex before it can inhibit ACTH. Without R, this mediated feedback path cannot operate. The CRH inhibition does not require R, the OR driven receptor synthesis is a positive regulation rather than a negative feedback link, and ACTH stimulating cortisol is upstream of R.

- [BT2] NARROWEST PREREQUISITES OR CONDITIONAL GATE

• Task: Identify which stage in a workflow is subject to the narrowest set of prerequisites or the most restrictive conditional gate.

BT2 Example

Question Paper: The Federal Rulemaking Process: An Overview Topology: Institutional Decision / Policy Process Workflow Considering the exceptions described for different kinds of agencies and rules, which of the following steps in the federal rulemaking workflow is subject to the narrowest set of prerequisites? Options

- • A) Publication of Notice of Proposed Rulemaking
- • B) OMB OIRA review of draft proposed rule
- • C) Public comments
- • D) Response to comments and development of draft final rule

Answer B

Reasoning

OMB OIRA review occurs only when the rule is significant and the issuing body is not an independent regulatory agency, so it has a more restrictive gate than the other stages. The NPRM, comment, and response stages may be skipped in some cases, but they are not additionally limited by the same significance and agency type conditions.

- [BT3] BYPASS PATH IDENTIFICATION

• Task: If a specific transition is blocked, identify which alternative pathways remain valid to reach the same destination.

BT3 Example

Question Paper: Synergistic Catalysis in Heterobimetallic Complexes for CO2 Hydrogenation Topology: Catalytic Cycle / Mechanism State Graph Suppose the inner sphere transition state TS3 is completely blocked. Which of the following describe a remaining valid pathway by which the hydride complex [IrIII H] can still be converted into the formate complex [IrIII HCO2]? Select all that apply. Options

- • A) [IrIII H] → TS3 → [IrIII HCO2]
- • B) [IrIII H] → TS2 → [IrIII HCO2]* → [IrIII HCO2]
- • C) [IrIII H] → [IrIII(Base)]+ → [IrIII HCO2]
- • D) [IrIII H] → [IrIII(eta2 H2)]PF6 → TS1 → [IrIII HCO2]

Answer B

Reasoning Blocking TS3 removes the direct inner sphere conversion. A remaining route is described via TS2 that forms the adduct [IrIII HCO2]*, which then rearranges to [IrIII HCO2]. The other sequences do not provide a complete directionally consistent path once TS3 is unavailable.

- [BT4] HEDGED OR STABLE FLOW IDENTIFICATION

• Task: Identify which payment flow or connection is structurally protected against external shocks due to a stabilizing mechanism in the system.

#### BT4 Example

Question Paper: Modeling Multiple Event Catastrophe Bond Prices Involving the Trigger Event Correlation, Interest, and Inflation Rates Topology: Securitization / Structured Finance A sudden spike in market interest rates threatens the returns on the short term securities held for the bond. Thanks to the SPV’s LIBOR based floating swap, which of the following payment lines is most likely to keep its value stable despite that shock? Options

- • A) Principal repayment from Special Purpose Vehicle to Investor
- • B) Premium transfer from Sponsor to Special Purpose Vehicle
- • C) Investment income remittance from Trust Account to Special Purpose Vehicle
- • D) Coupon payments from Special Purpose Vehicle to Investor

Answer C

Reasoning

The LIBOR linked swap converts the Trust Account returns into floating payments tied to LIBOR before those proceeds are remitted onward. This buffering happens before the money reaches the SPV, so the Trust Account to SPV investment income flow is the most protected against an interest rate shock. The other flows are fixed transfers or are halted under certain conditions, and they are not directly stabilized by the swap mechanism.

- [BT5] INVARIANT CONNECTIONS ACROSS MODES

• Task: Identify which connections are structurally present in both of two different operating modes.

BT5 Example

Question Paper: M3DocRAG: Multi modal Retrieval for Multi page Multi document Understanding Topology: RAG Agent Tool Use Component Architecture Which of the following connections are active in both the closed domain and open domain operating modes of M3DocRAG? Select all that apply. Options

- • A) Visual Encoder (ColPali) → page visual embeddings
- • B) Text Encoder (ColPali) → MaxSim relevance scorer
- • C) Page visual embeddings → IVF (IVFFlat) approximate index
- • D) Exact exhaustive search over a single document’s pages → top K page selection

Answer A, B

Reasoning Both modes embed pages with the Visual Encoder and compute similarity using MaxSim, so A and B are present in both settings. The IVF based approximate index is specific to open domain retrieval, while the exact exhaustive search is specific to closed domain retrieval.

- [BT6] BYPASS PATH AFTER EDGE REMOVAL

• Task: After a direct link is eliminated, identify which remaining pathway most plausibly allows influence to flow between the same endpoints.

#### BT6 Example

Question Paper: Governance and everyday adaptations? Examining the disconnect between planned and autonomous adaptation Topology: Institutional / Governance Framework Diagram Suppose the direct link in which Governance systems set procedural and distributive conditions for Adaptation action situations is eliminated. Which remaining pathway most plausibly allows Governance systems to continue exerting influence on the eventual Justice outcomes? Options

- • A) Governance systems → Adaptation action situations → Justice outcomes
- • B) Governance systems → Actors → Adaptation action situations → Justice outcomes
- • C) Governance systems → Ecological and technological systems → Environmental and technological parameters → Adaptation action situations → Justice outcomes
- • D) Governance systems ← Adaptation action situations → Actors → Justice outcomes

Answer B

Reasoning

Even without the direct Governance to Adaptation edge, Governance systems still set rules for Actors. Those Actors participate in Adaptation action situations, which then produce Justice outcomes. This provides a plausible bypass route that preserves influence from Governance to the eventual outcome without relying on the removed link.

#### B.4. Counterfactual Reasoning Task Examples

Counterfactual Reasoning evaluates whether models can reason under “what-if” modifications—changing a fact, constraint, or event—and predict how conclusions should change while keeping everything else fixed. The key feature is causal/structural sensitivity: models must separate invariant background from the altered premise and update only the consequences entailed by the counterfactual.

- [CR1] DOWNSTREAM CONSEQUENCE OF BROKEN LINK

• Task: If a causal link fails to transmit its effect, identify which subsequent outcome in the pathway would be most directly undermined.

CR1 Example

Question Paper: Healthy food prescription incentive programme for adults with type 2 diabetes who are experiencing food insecurity Topology: Logic Model / Theory of Change

According to the described theory of change, reduced food insecurity and improved diet quality are key mediators for improving blood glucose levels. If a patient’s diet quality improved but this specific change failed to translate into improved blood glucose levels (A1C), which subsequent outcome in the causal pathway would be most directly undermined?

Options

- • A) A reduction in food insecurity
- • B) A reduction in diabetes complications
- • C) The integration of data from modelling studies
- • D) An improvement in blood glucose levels (A1C)

Answer B

Reasoning

The model implies a chain where improved diet quality should improve blood glucose levels, which then helps reduce diabetes complications. If the link from improved diet quality to improved blood glucose is broken, the most directly downstream outcome that loses its support is the reduction in complications. Food insecurity is an upstream parallel mediator, integration of data is not part of the patient outcome chain, and improved blood glucose is the intermediate step that is failing rather than the subsequent outcome.

- [CR2] LARGEST DROP IN ASSOCIATION STRENGTH

• Task: If a specific edge is removed from a mediation model, identify which other association would show the largest drop in overall strength.

#### CR2 Example

Question Paper: Structural equation modeling of social media addiction with eating behavior Topology: Path Diagram / SEM / Mediation Model

Suppose researchers replace the Body Image construct with a version that keeps all of its original connections except that it no longer sends any influence to Restrained Eating (EB RE). With every other pathway left intact, which linkage in the model would you expect to show the largest drop in overall strength as a consequence of this modification?

###### Options

- • A) Social Media Addiction → Emotional Eating (EB EE)
- • B) Body Image → External Stimuli (EB ES)
- • C) Social Media Addiction → Restrained Eating (EB RE)
- • D) Social Media Addiction → Body Image

Answer C

Reasoning

Removing the Body Image to Restrained Eating edge eliminates the indirect route from Social Media Addiction to Restrained Eating that passes through Body Image. That deletion reduces the total association for the Social Media Addiction to Restrained Eating linkage the most. The other listed connections do not rely on the removed edge, so their strength is not structurally diminished in the same way.

- [CR3] STRUCTURAL CONSEQUENCES OF ADDING AN EDGE

• Task: If a new direct link is introduced, identify which structural consequences necessarily follow.

CR3 Example

Question Paper: SuperFlow: A Fully Customized RTL to GDS Design Automation Flow Topology: EDA Toolchain / Design Flow Diagram Suppose a new direct link is introduced that allows the AQFP based netlist to feed straight into the circuit layout generation stage, bypassing the normal place and route step. Based purely on this topological change, which of the following statements are necessarily true? Select all that apply. Options

- • A) The circuit layout generation stage can now be reached even if the place and route step is skipped.
- • B) The place and route step is completely eliminated from every possible path that leads to the final GDSII layout.
- • C) The Design Rule Check (DRC) may now receive a layout that never passed through the place and route step.
- • D) Logic synthesis (Yosys) is no longer required to obtain the GDSII layout.

Answer A, C

Reasoning

The new shortcut creates an additional path where circuit layout generation is reachable directly from the AQFP netlist, so A becomes true. Because DRC is downstream of layout generation, C also becomes true since DRC can now be reached through a path that never traverses place and route. The original path that includes place and route still exists, so B does not necessarily follow. Logic synthesis is still required to produce the netlist inputs, so D is not implied by the added edge.

- [CR4] CONSEQUENCE OF BLOCKING PARALLEL FEEDBACK PATH

• Task: If a feedback pathway operating in parallel with a primary mechanism is blocked, identify the most direct structural consequence.

CR4 Example

Question Paper: Human Investigations into the Arterial and Cardiopulmonary Baroreflexes during Exercise Topology: Homeostatic Feedback Control Loop The text identifies the exercise pressor reflex as a feedback mechanism. If this entire feedback pathway were selectively blocked, what would be the most direct structural consequence on the system that adjusts cardiovascular function during exercise? Options

- • A) Central Command would be unable to regulate baroreflex resetting.
- • B) Cardiopulmonary baroreceptors would take over as the primary regulatory input.
- • C) The feed forward regulation from Central Command would continue, but without the modulatory influence from the reflex.
- • D) The entire system for neural cardiovascular adjustment to exercise would cease to function.

Answer C

Reasoning

Central Command is described as a feed forward driver that can continue to regulate cardiovascular responses. The exercise pressor reflex is a parallel feedback pathway that modulates the response. Blocking it removes that modulatory feedback while leaving the primary feed forward route intact, making C the most direct structural consequence.

- [CR5] PATHS BLOCKED BY REMOVING CONDITIONING

• Task: If a collider node is no longer conditioned on, identify which influence chains would no longer transmit association.

#### CR5 Example

Question Paper: Use of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to identify confounders Topology: Causal DAG Conditioning on the Mediator (M) currently opens the collider at M. If we instead leave M unconditioned, which of the following influence chains would no longer transmit association? Select all that apply.

###### Options

- • A) The mediated causal path Exposure → Mediator → Outcome
- • B) The collider path Exposure → Mediator ← MOC → Outcome
- • C) The confounding path Observed confounder → Exposure
- • D) The collider link Exposure → Mediator ← MOC (association between Exposure and MOC)

Answer B, D

Reasoning

When M is not conditioned on, it functions as a collider and blocks any association path that must pass through the converging arrows at M. The paths in B and D rely on traversing the collider structure Exposure → M ← MOC, so they are closed without conditioning. The standard mediated path Exposure → M → Outcome and the confounding link to Exposure do not require opening the collider, so they remain available.

- [CR6] SURVIVING ROUTES WHEN NODE IS CLAMPED

• Task: If a mediator node is experimentally held constant, identify which structural routes can still convey an effect to the outcome.

CR6 Example

Question Paper: The chain mediating role of interest and physical activity level Topology: Path Diagram / SEM / Mediation Model Researchers raise PE teacher autonomy support but keep pupils’ physical activity levels fixed at a constant value. According to the mediation model, through which of the following routes can this manipulation still influence pupils’ physical and mental health? Select all that apply. Options

- • A) PE teacher autonomy support → physical activity levels → physical and mental health
- • B) PE teacher autonomy support → physical and mental health
- • C) PE teacher autonomy support → interest → physical activity levels → physical and mental health
- • D) PE teacher autonomy support → interest → physical and mental health

Answer B, D

Reasoning

Clamping physical activity levels prevents any causal effect from propagating through that node. Routes A and C necessarily pass through physical activity levels, so they are blocked. The direct path from autonomy support to health and the route through interest alone both avoid the fixed node, so B and D can still transmit an effect.

- [CR7] INVARIANT OUTPUT UNDER SOURCE CHANGE

• Task: If the source of a component’s input is changed to a different upstream pathway, identify which downstream component’s activation would remain essentially unchanged.

#### CR7 Example

Question Paper: The Renin Angiotensin System in Cardiovascular Autonomic Control Topology: Physiological Pathway / Axis Network Suppose the pathway is re engineered so that all Angiotensin (1 7) is produced exclusively from Angiotensin I (via Angiotensin (1 9)) instead of from Angiotensin II. Assuming no other reactions are altered, which of the following components is expected to show the least change in its level of activation? Options

- • A) Angiotensin (1 9)
- • B) AT1R
- • C) Mas R
- • D) Angiotensin A

Answer C

Reasoning

Both the original and modified production routes converge at Angiotensin (1 7). Mas R is directly downstream of Angiotensin (1 7), so its activation depends primarily on the presence of Angiotensin (1 7) rather than on which upstream precursor supplied it. By contrast, Angiotensin (1 9) is introduced in the new route, AT1R is

driven mainly by Angiotensin II and related peptides, and Angiotensin A formation depends on Angiotensin II, so those quantities change under the source swap.

### C. Dataset Curation

In this section, we provide a detailed breakdown of the data curation pipeline and prompts used in this process. We first present the specific prompts and multi-step workflows used by our automated ’Dataset Builder’ to source papers, normalize data schemas, and extract structural graphs (Sec. C.1). Next, we document the prompts used for question generation and automated quality control (Sec. C.2). Additionally, we organize the question type templates used for question generation (Sec. C.3). Finally, we outline the human evaluation checklists and protocols used to ensure the validity and accuracy of the dataset (Sec. C.4).

#### C.1. Sample Collection Prompts

This section details the automated pipeline used to source and structure the raw data for our dataset. The process is divided into four sequential steps: (1) Candidate Search, where the model identifies relevant papers and figures; (2) Schema Normalization, which converts raw outputs into strict JSON formats; (3) Caption Consistency, which verifies that retrieved metadata matches the specific figure; and (4) Graph Extraction, where the visual diagram is parsed into a structured node-link graph representation. The specific system prompts for each stage are provided below.

#### Step 1: Paper Search

• Goal: Find one strong paper and one exact figure identifier for a topology category.

Step 1 Prompt: Paper Search

Task You are curating ONE high quality sample for the SciStruct benchmark.

Goal Find ONE strong Algorithm or AI research paper that contains a structural node link diagram matching the category:

- • Topology category: {category}
- • Category description: {cat desc} Hard constraints

- 1. Deduplication: Do not select any paper in [{already collected str}]

- 2. Top tier source: Prefer strong venues and widely cited reports. Provide a stable link.
- 3. Strict diagram validity: The chosen figure must be representable as a single connected node link graph G = (V, E). Nodes must be labeled blocks with readable text. Links must be explicit connectors indicating flow or dependency. Reject plots, tables, photos, qualitative samples, or disconnected mini diagrams.
- 4. Category semantic match: The diagram must match the node and link semantics in {cat desc}.

- 5. Exact figure ID: Verify the caption explicitly starts with Figure X or Fig. X. If uncertain, discard.

Output format (JSON only) Return exactly one JSON object (no markdown, no extra commentary):

{ "paper metadata": { "title": "Full Paper Title", "paper link": "Direct link to the paper", "topology type": "{category}" }, "figure": { "figure id": "Figure X", "figure caption snippet": "Copy one to two caption sentences (30 to 80 words)" }, "selection rationale": "One to three sentences: validity and semantics match", "figure id verification": "One to two sentences: how the figure ID was verified" }

#### Step 2: Strict Schema Normalization

• Goal: Rewrite the draft object into a strict JSON schema.

#### Step 2 Prompt: Strict JSON Rewriter

You are a strict JSON rewriter. Input is a draft object that may miss fields or contain noisy strings. Rewrite into exactly one JSON object with this schema:

{ "paper metadata": { "title": "Full Paper Title", "paper link": "Direct link to the paper", "topology type": "{category}" }, "figure": { "figure id": "Figure X", "figure caption snippet": "short snippet containing the label and diagram context" }, "selection rationale": "One to three sentences: validity and semantics match", "figure id verification": "One to two sentences: how the figure ID was verified" }

Rules:

- • Keep URLs as is. Do not invent a new paper.
- • Ensure topology type equals {category} exactly.

- • Return JSON only. Draft:

{draft obj json}

#### Step 3: Caption Consistency Check

• Goal: Confirm the web snippet plausibly refers to the same caption as the PDF extracted caption text.

Step 3 Prompt: Lenient Caption Consistency Checker

You are a lenient caption consistency checker. We have:

- • fig id: {fig id}

- • model claim snippet: a short or partial snippet produced during web search

- • true caption: text extracted near the real Figure or Fig. label in the PDF

Goal: Decide whether model claim snippet is plausibly referring to the same figure caption as true caption. Do not penalize incompleteness. If unsure, choose match true.

Return mismatch only if clearly unrelated, for example:

- 1. The snippet refers to a different figure or table number
- 2. Topics are obviously different with near zero shared technical terms
- 3. The snippet is clearly from a different paper and not about the same caption Return JSON only:

{ "match": true or false, "reason": "short explanation" }

model claim snippet: {model snippet}

true caption: {true caption}

#### Step 4: Structural Validity Check

• Goal: Decide if the diagram is representable as a clean node link graph, then extract nodes and links.

#### Step 4 Prompt: Structural Validity Check

Role: You are a professional Visual Graph Analyzer and Data Engineer. Task:

- 1. Decide whether the provided structural diagram can be represented well as a simple node link graph JSON.
- 2. If feasible, convert it into the required JSON format. Feasibility criteria (strict):

- • Primarily a node link structural diagram such as a flowchart, architecture, pipeline, or logic map
- • Most nodes have meaningful labels, not anonymous placeholders
- • Links reflect real relations or flows and direction can be inferred
- • One connected component
- • Reject plots, tables, photos, qualitative grids, or math only figures
- • Reject if unreadable or too overloaded for reliable extraction If the diagram fails feasibility, return only:

{ "ok": false, "reason": "one to two sentences" }

If the diagram passes, extraction rules:

- • Nodes: labeled blocks or entities with text, each with a unique id and label
- • Links: directed edges from source to target, with optional label (empty string if none)
- • Ignore decorative elements and background noise
- • If a link is bidirectional, emit two directed links Output format for pass case (JSON only):

{ "ok": true, "reason": "one to two sentences", "graph": { "nodes": [{ "id": "n1", "label": "Node Text" }], "links": [{ "source": "n1", "target": "n2", "label": "" }]

} }

#### C.2. T2S Muti-hoop Reasoning Dataset Construction Prompts

Once the structural graph is extracted, we employ a three-stage prompting strategy to create and validate benchmark questions. First, the Question Generation prompt instantiates a specific reasoning template (see Sec. C.3) grounded in the text and diagram. This is followed by two rigorous quality control steps: a Diagram Consistency Check to ensure the question and answer are supported by the visual topology, and a Text-Only Solvability Check to verify that the answer can be derived via reasoning from the text description alone, without relying on visual cues.

#### Step 1: Class Specific Question Generation

• Goal: Generate one multiple choice question for a target reasoning class grounded in the diagram topology and text paragraph.

#### QA Prompt: General Rules and Required JSON Schema

You are designing benchmark questions for SciStruct (text only evaluation about a system diagram). You are given:

- • A reference diagram image used only to align the question to the true topology. Do not mention the image.
- • A text paragraph extracted from the paper describing that diagram. Core requirements:
- • Multiple choice only, single select or multi select, exactly four options A to D

- • Grounding is strict: stem and all options must reference concrete nodes, edges, relations, or topology structures present
- • Text only solvability: the correct answer must be derivable from the text alone via structural reasoning
- • Non triviality is strict: require at least two reasoning steps, not a one hop lookup
- • Distractors must be plausible but topologically wrong
- • Randomize answer position across A to D
- • Do not mention Figure, image, or as shown
- • Math must use Markdown math like $x to y$

Template compliance:

- • Generate exactly one question for the target class
- • Choose exactly one template among eight templates for that class
- • The chosen template id must match the reasoning structure in analysis plan Return JSON only with schema:

{ "question class": "{TARGET CLASS}", "template id": "{ONE TEMPLATE ID}", "type": "single" or "multi", "analysis plan": { "target query": "...", "key nodes": ["..."], "key edges or relations": ["..."], "two hop witness": "...", "why not one hop": "..." }, "question": "...", "options": [

- { "id":"A", "text":"..." },
- { "id":"B", "text":"..." },
- { "id":"C", "text":"..." },
- { "id":"D", "text":"..." } ], "answer": ["B"] or ["B","D"], "reason": "one to three sentences" }

Hard constraints on analysis plan:

- • Include at least two distinct relations, or a branch merge bypass or condition argument
- • Include an explicit two hop witness such as A toM toZ, or an equivalent multi step structural argument
- • If you cannot find a two hop witness from the text, regenerate a different question

#### Step 2: Diagram Grounded Quality Control

• Goal: Verify the question stem and provided answer are fully supported by the diagram topology and remain non trivial.

#### QC Prompt: Image Grounded Diagram Consistency Checker

You are a high strictness diagram consistency checker for SciStruct. You are given:

- • A reference diagram image
- • A candidate multiple choice question JSON including the provided answer

Primary goal: Verify the question and the provided correct answer are fully supported by the diagram. If pass true, explain the diagram evidence. If pass false, explain the mismatch.

Checks:

- 1. Stem grounding: stem refers to relations that exist in the diagram
- 2. Answer verification: each answer option is correct under the diagram
- 3. Anti triviality: fail if it is a one hop neighbor lookup Return JSON only:

{ "pass": true or false, "verdict": "one to two sentences", "diagram alignment": { "stem supported": true or false, "stem evidence": ["..."], "answer supported": true or false, "answer evidence": ["..."] }, "errors": [] or ["..."] }

Candidate: {question json}

#### Step 3: Text Only Solvability Quality Control

• Goal: Verify the question and answer are derivable from the text paragraph alone using multi step structural reasoning.

#### QC Prompt: Text Only Solvability Checker

You are a high strictness text only solvability checker for SciStruct. You are given:

- • A text paragraph describing a system
- • A candidate multiple choice question JSON including the provided answer Primary goal: Verify the question and provided answer can be derived from the text alone. If unsure, set pass false. Checks:

- 1. Answer derivability with at least two step reasoning over relations
- 2. Not keyword lookup: fail if answer is a direct phrase match without structural inference
- 3. Visual only dependency: fail if required facts are only in the diagram
- 4. Anti guessing: fail if correct answer is guessable by surface semantics alone
- 5. Anti leakage: fail if ordinal cues like Stage or Step reveal topology ordering Return JSON only:

{ "pass": true or false, "verdict": "one to two sentences", "text support": { "answer supported": true or false, "conclusion": "reasoning chain or missing evidence" }, "nontrivial ok": true or false, "nontrivial analysis": "...", "errors": [] or ["..."] }

TEXT (markdown): {extracted paragraph md}

Candidate: {question json}

#### C.3. Question Type Templates

To ensure diverse and rigorous reasoning requirements, we utilize a library of parameterized templates corresponding to specific reasoning classes (e.g., Fault Localization, Functional Mapping). Each class contains a set of logic templates (e.g., ’Bottleneck Identification’ or ’Feedback Loop Failure’) that define the core reasoning task. The prompt blocks below list the logic definitions and constraints used to guide the model during the question generation phase described in Sec. C.2.

#### Fault Localization Template

This block is provided only when target class = "Fault Localization". Allowed template ids: [FL-1,FL-2,FL-3,FL-4,FL-5,FL-6,FL-7,FL-8] Templates (choose exactly one template id):

- FL-1 Upstream Root-Cause Set (Multi-select) Core logic: Given an abnormality in a key output [Z] (too high/too low/missing), ask which components or variables could plausibly be upstream on a directed causal or dependency path leading to Z. Correct options: Select 2 to 4 nodes that have at least one directed path to Z (mix direct parents and more distant ancestors). Ensure evidence is spread across multiple sentences or clauses. Distractors:

- 1. parallel branch nodes that do not reach Z
- 2. downstream effects of Z
- 3. nodes only connected under a condition not satisfied in the stem
- 4. same domain nodes with similar wording but wrong topology

- FL-2 Secondly or Thirdly Affected Downstream (Single- or Multi-select) Core logic: If [A] fails, stops responding, or is removed, which components are the secondly or thirdly impacted ? Correct option: the second or third component is affected. Distractors: direct successor, parallel branch, bypass protected node.
- FL-3 Minimal Cut Set for Failure (Multi-select, Hard) Core logic: To make [Z] impossible to produce (or guaranteed to fail), which option sets are sufficient and approximately minimal cut sets that disconnect all paths to Z? Correct options: 2 to 3 small node sets or edge sets that, if removed, break every path from relevant sources to Z (true cut sets). Distractors: sets that break only one path while leaving an alternative; sets that include redundant nodes (not minimal); sets containing only downstream nodes that do not prevent generation.
- FL-4 Bottleneck or Dominator Node (Single-select) Core logic: Which node is the strongest bottleneck between [S] and [Z] (most paths must go through it; its failure knocks out multiple routes)? Correct option: a dominator or articulation like node shared by many paths. Distractors: nodes in only one branch; nodes at same depth but not shared; nodes in a feedback loop that does not dominate routes to Z.
- FL-5 Abnormal Intermediate but Output Still Normal (Single- or Multi-select) Core logic: You observe intermediate [M] is abnormal but [Z] is not yet abnormal. Which upstream nodes are plausible root causes consistent with that pattern (e.g., buffering, redundancy, delay)? Correct options: ancestors of M that can explain Z not yet impacted via redundancy, lag, or bypasses described in text. Distractors: downstream of M; unrelated parallel modules; nodes that would necessarily affect Z immediately (contradicting the observation).
- FL-6 Branch Isolation: Who Is Unaffected (Single-select) Core logic: Given flow from [S], if [M] fails, which node will not be affected because it is in an independent parallel branch (no propagation path)? Correct option: a node topologically disconnected from M’s influence (or only connected via inactive conditional edge). Distractors: descendants of M; nodes after a shared bottleneck; nodes in the same feedback subgraph.
- FL-7 Failure Amplification in a Feedback Loop (Single-select) Core logic: The text describes a feedback loop. If anomalies amplify or fail to converge, which component is the most likely amplification point (gain point in positive feedback or failed inhibitor)? Correct option: a node or edge in the loop associated with strengthening or positive feedback or a missing inhibitor. Distractors: loop external nodes; pure output or visualization nodes; downstream nodes not feeding back.
- FL-8 Shared Upstream Cause for Two Abnormal Outputs (Multi-select) Core logic: If both [Z1] and [Z2] are abnormal, which nodes are common upstream ancestors that could explain a single shared cause? Correct options: nodes in the intersection of ancestors of Z1 and Z2. Distractors: nodes unique to only one output’s ancestry; nodes that are purely downstream of either output; parallel branch nodes.

#### Functional Mapping Template

This block is provided only when target class = "Functional Mapping". Allowed template ids: [FM-1,FM-2,FM-3,FM-4,FM-5,FM-6,FM-7,FM-8] Templates (choose exactly one template id):

- FM-1 Router or Selector Identification (Single-select) Core logic: Which component best matches a routing or selection role (chooses among alternatives or sends inputs to different branches, often condition or gating driven)? Correct option: node with branching out degree and conditional or gating language. Distractors: 1 in 1 out transformation nodes; multi in 1 out aggregators; terminal outputs.
- FM-2 Aggregator or Fusion Node (Single-select) Core logic: Which node best matches an aggregation or fusion role (merges multiple upstream sources into a unified representation or decision)? Correct option: multi in 1 out join node with combine, integrate, or aggregate semantics. Distractors: routers (1 in many out); monitoring only nodes; leaf outputs.
- FM-3 Buffer or Storage or Delay Role (Single-select)

- Core logic: Which component most plausibly acts as buffer, storage, or state (absorbs fluctuations, supports delayed consistency, caches history)? Correct option: node described with cache, memory, state, or history and positioned on a main path. Distractors: pure compute or transform modules; terminal outputs; controllers with no state persistence.
- FM-4 Controller or Constraint or Tuner Nodes (Multi-select) Core logic: Which components are controllers, constraints, or tuners (modify other modules’ behavior rather than directly producing Z)? Correct options: nodes with modulatory edges to multiple components (set thresholds, gate, regularize, optimize, constrain). Distractors: passive processing nodes; purely downstream effect nodes; metrics that only observe.
- FM-5 Mediator vs Direct Cause (Single-select) Core logic: Text says [A] influences [Z]. Which node is the best mediator (A primarily affects Z through it: A→M→Z)? Correct option: node on the primary path between A and Z where removing or holding it would block A’s effect. Distractors: nodes connected to A and Z but not on a directed path; parallel nodes; downstream only nodes.
- FM-6 Measurement or Metric Nodes (Single- or Multi-select) Core logic: Which elements are measurement, evaluation, or monitoring outputs rather than mechanistic drivers? Correct options: loss, score, assay, or metric nodes, often terminal or side channel observers. Distractors: mechanistic nodes that drive changes; controllers; main transformation stages.
- FM-7 Domain Transformation Core Step (Single-select) Core logic: Treat the system as mapping [input domain] → [output domain]. Which node is the key representation or domain transformation step? Correct option: central transform on the main information path where type or representation changes. Distractors: purely controlling or gating nodes; terminal outputs; minor preprocessing nodes not central.
- FM-8 Parallel Complementary Subfunctions (Multi-select) Core logic: The text describes parallel branches contributing to [Z]. Which branches are complementary subfunctions (different subproblems) rather than redundant backups? Correct options: branches with distinct inputs or subtasks that later converge. Distractors: clearly redundant branches performing the same role; branches that never converge to Z; downstream only duplications.

#### Boundary Testing Template

This block is provided only when target class = "Boundary Testing". Allowed template ids: [BT-1,BT-2,BT-3,BT-4,BT-5,BT-6,BT-7,BT-8] Templates (choose exactly one template id):

- BT-1 Conditional Edge Activation or Deactivation (Single-select) Core logic: The text indicates a dependency holds only under [Cond]. If Cond is not satisfied, which end to end capability or output is lost because no path remains? Correct option: the unique path whose reachability depends on the conditional edge. Distractors: unconditional paths; alternative bypass paths; relations that do not depend on Cond.
- BT-2 Narrowest Validity or Most Assumption Dependent Module (Single-select) Core logic: Based on explicit assumptions or prerequisites, which component has the narrowest applicability (most assumption dependent)? Correct option: node most frequently qualified by only when, assuming, under. Distractors: generic baseline modules; mechanistic steps stated as broadly valid; outputs or metrics.
- BT-3 Threshold or Saturation or Regime Shift Point (Single-select) Core logic: The text implies thresholds, saturation, capacity limits, or regime shifts. Which component is the most likely behavior flip point? Correct option: node with nonlinearity, capacity, gain, or limit language on a main path. Distractors: linear relay nodes; pure output nodes; unrelated parallel modules.
- BT-4 Redundancy or Alternate Path Existence (Multi-select) Core logic: If connection [L] is cut, can [Z] still receive input from [S] via alternate routes? Select all options that describe a valid bypass path. Correct options: real paths S→...→Z that do not traverse L and are consistent with direction or conditions. Distractors: reversed directions; missing edges; paths requiring an unstated condition; near miss paths that end at the wrong node.
- BT-5 Most Robust Output Under Upstream Perturbation (Single-select) Core logic: Under perturbation, noise, or missingness in [S], which output is most likely to remain stable given buffering, redundancy, fusion, or closed loop correction? Correct option: output protected by explicit structural safeguards. Distractors: outputs supported by a single brittle path; outputs relying on a narrow assumption bound module.
- BT-6 Invariance Across Conditions (Multi-select) Core logic: Which dependencies are most likely invariant across changes in [Cond] (mechanistic or structural vs scenario specific)? Correct options: edges described as structural or mechanistic, not contingent. Distractors: statistical associations; explicitly scenario conditioned relations; edges stated to vary with context.
- BT-7 Bypass Leakage Despite Isolation (Single-select) Core logic: You isolate [A] to prevent it from influencing [Z], but leakage may occur via a bypass. Which structure best explains how influence still reaches Z? Correct option: an alternative path from A to Z (or via a shared aggregator) remains intact. Distractors: structures where all A→Z paths are cut; purely downstream explanations; unrelated parallel branches.
- BT-8 OOD or Domain Shift Weak Link (Single-select) Core logic: Under domain shift (new distribution or source), which module is most likely to fail first and degrade the full chain? Correct option: module relying on calibration, lookup, mapping tables, or strong distributional assumptions. Distractors: mechanistic constraints; redundancy protected stages; measurement nodes that do not drive behavior.

#### Counterfactual Reasoning Template

This block is provided only when target class = "Counterfactual Reasoning". Allowed template ids: [CR-1,CR-2,CR-3,CR-4,CR-5,CR-6,CR-7,CR-8] Templates (choose exactly one template id):

- CR-1 Remove an Edge: Output Change (Single-select) Core logic: If the relation [A→B] is removed while everything else stays fixed, which output becomes unreachable. Correct option: B’s downstream output node on the main path. Distractors: upstream of A; unrelated parallel nodes; far downstream nodes when a nearer downstream exists.
- CR-2 Flip Edge Polarity: Which Outputs Reverse Direction (Multi-select) Core logic: Flip [A’s effect on B] from promoting→inhibiting (or vice versa). Which outputs most likely have their change direction reversed under the same intervention? Correct options: outputs primarily dependent on the A→B→...→Z path without strong compensating parallel routes. Distractors: outputs not reachable from B; outputs dominated by alternative paths; outputs whose direction is ambiguous without extra dynamics.
- CR-3 Replace a Module with an Almost Equivalent Version (Single-select) Core logic: Replace [M] with a version that is functionally similar but lacks [subfunction]. Which observation most cleanly distinguishes before vs after? Correct option: outcome that depends specifically on that subfunction along a path to Z. Distractors: outcomes unrelated to the missing subfunction; metrics that do not reflect the affected pathway; parallel branch outcomes.
- CR-4 Add a Shortcut Edge: What Must or May Change (Multi-select) Core logic: Add a new edge [A→Z] that bypasses intermediates. Which structural conclusions are supported? (Multi-select) Correct options (typical):

- • Z becomes more sensitive to A
- • intermediates on the old path become less critical
- • redundancy may increase if both routes remain Distractors: claims that require dynamics (e.g., Z is necessarily more stable), which cannot be guaranteed purely from topology.

- CR-5 Disable a Feedback Loop: Convergence Implications (Single-select) Core logic: Disable the feedback loop [X→...→X]. Which consequence best matches structure given the loop’s sign (positive vs negative) inferred from text? Correct option: removal of self correction if negative feedback; removal of amplification or oscillation driver if positive feedback. Distractors: outcomes unrelated to feedback; purely observational changes; effects that contradict loop sign.
- CR-6 Flip a Condition: Which Effects Disappear (Multi-select) Core logic: A→Z holds only when [Cond] is true. Set Cond to false. Which influence chains should disappear? Correct options: all paths whose reachability depends on the conditional edge(s). Distractors: unconditional paths; paths that depend on different conditions; downstream only effects.
- CR-7 Dual Intervention to Separate Direct vs Indirect Effects (Multi-select, Hard) Core logic: Intervene on [A] while holding [M] fixed (or also intervening on M). Which observations best distinguish A’s direct effect on Z from its mediated effect via M? Correct options: statements reflecting block the mediator, test whether A still changes Z, or control M to isolate the direct path. Distractors: correlation only statements; observations that do not mention blocking or controlling a path; claims requiring parameter values not present.
- CR-8 Swap Upstream Source: Which Downstream Stays Similar (Single-select) Core logic: Swap upstream input from [S1] to [S2], and the text indicates they merge at some node [J]. Which output should change least (or remain invariant) structurally? Correct option: outputs located downstream of the merge J and dependent only on shared subgraph. Distractors: outputs upstream of J; outputs depending on S1 specific branch; outputs driven by side branches that do not share.

#### C.4. Human Evaluation Checklist

The construction of the T2S-Bench dataset followed a rigorous three-stage human quality assurance (QA) pipeline to ensure the accuracy, consistency, and usability of each sample. In every stage, we employed a structured checklist-based review process, where each sample was meticulously evaluated across a range of quality dimensions—such as correctness, relevance to the source text, structural coherence, and task difficulty. Only those samples that successfully passed all items in the checklist at every round were retained in the final dataset. This multi-round validation protocol significantly enhances the reliability and interpretability of T2S-Bench, making it a robust benchmark for evaluating text-to-structure capabilities. In this section, we present the detailed QA checklists used across the three rounds.

First-Round Human Checklist. The goal of the first round of human quality assurance was to filter out structurally noisy or low-quality samples that could compromise the integrity of the dataset. This initial screening focused on identifying and removing examples with incomplete or misleading structures, ensuring that only samples with a clear and coherent structural representation were retained. Specifically, annotators were instructed to evaluate the following aspects:

- 1. Are both nodes and links present?
- 2. Does every node have a clear corresponding entity/semantic meaning?
- 3. Does every link have a clear source and target?

- 4. Does the diagram contain noise?
- 5. Is the number of nodes appropriate (greater than 5 and fewer than 20)?
- 6. Is the number of edges appropriate (greater than 5 and fewer than 40)?
- 7. Are there multiple nodes with duplicate names?
- 8. Is each node expressed as a phrase or a set of short phrases (rather than long sentences)?
- 9. Is the sample a single, self-contained structure graph, without nested containment or multiple independent sub-structures?

Second-Round Human Checklist.The second round of quality assurance focused on validating the correctness and solvability of the questions designed for model evaluation. In this phase, annotators were required to carefully read the input text, interpret the associated structure, and independently attempt to solve each task as if they were language models. This ensured that the tasks were not only well-formed but also answerable based on the provided information. The checklist for this round included the following criteria:

- 1. Correctness Check: Is the answer correct?
- 2. Text Dependency Check: Can the answer be inferred from the text?
- 3. Difficulty Check: Is the question overly easy—i.e., can it be answered by directly locating a span in the text without meaningful reasoning?
- 4. Typo Check: Is the question semantically coherent and free of typos?
- 5. Format Check: Are symbols and equations in the question properly formatted in Markdown?

Third-Round Human Checklist. The third round of quality assurance was designed to validate the alignment between the input text and its corresponding key structure. In this phase, annotators were first asked to independently derive the core structure—i.e., the key nodes and their relationships—based solely on the input text, without referring to the provided structure. They then compared their inferred structure with the given one to assess consistency and faithfulness. Samples with significant structural deviation, overly complex representations, or inconsistent mappings were filtered out. The checklist used in this stage included the following criteria:

- 1. Structure-Text Consistency: Does the provided structure accurately reflect the key information, logic, and flow of the original text?
- 2. Reproducibility: Can a well-informed annotator infer a similar structure from the text alone, without prior exposure to the given structure?
- 3. Over-Structuring Avoidance: Is the structure appropriately scoped, avoiding unnecessary complexity or overfragmentation of ideas?
- 4. Key Node Coverage: Are all critical concepts, entities, or steps in the text represented as distinct nodes in the structure?
- 5. Relation Accuracy: Are the links between nodes semantically correct, reflecting valid dependencies or logical flows?

### D. Model Evaluation Details

This section summarizes the evaluation procedure used for both multiple choice question answering and structure extraction tasks in the T2S benchmark. We report the prompt template, describe data layout assumptions, and detail the execution paths for API based models and open source models.

- D.1. Experiment setup Evaluation scripts. We provide two evaluation tracks:

- • Multiple choice question answering
- • Structure extraction

Dataset layout. Each benchmark sample is stored as a directory. The evaluator expects:

- • information.json inside each sample folder, containing the question and the ground truth answer.
- • One extracted markdown file, which provides the cleaned text paragraph used as the model input.

Prompt assembly. For multiple choice evaluation, the final prompt is assembled by concatenating:

- • a TEXT PARAGRAPH block from the extracted markdown
- • the QUESTION
- • the OPTIONS rendered as A. ..., B. ... etc
- • a strict output format instruction that forces an answer string

For structure extraction, we use a two stage protocol:

- • Stage 1 node labeling: input is text plus graph structure (links without labels) and node ids, output is JSON node labels
- • Stage 2 link extraction: input is text plus node list, output is JSON links

Decoding and determinism. All evaluation paths use deterministic decoding with temperature set to zero. The maximum generation length is set conservatively for each task (for example, longer for structure JSON, shorter for multiple choice answers).

#### D.2. API evaluation

API interface. API models are accessed through an OpenAI compatible chat completion interface. The evaluator accepts an API key and a base URL so that the same code path can evaluate models hosted behind different compatible gateways.

Rate limit handling and timeouts. For question answering, the API wrapper retries upon rate limit signals using exponential backoff. For structure extraction, the API wrapper additionally supports streaming responses and configurable read timeouts to prevent long running calls from hanging the evaluation.

Prompt specification for multiple choice QA. We enforce a strict output schema to make answer parsing robust. The following prompt components are used.

#### QA evaluation prompt contract

SYSTEM PROMPT You are a helpful assistant. Output only the final answer in the required format.

FORMAT INSTRUCTION Provide your final answer in the following format: For single select: [Answer] A For multi select: [Answer] A,C,D (comma separated option letters, no spaces) Output only the final answer with no extra explanation

Special casing for certain APIs. Some endpoints do not accept system messages reliably. In that case, the evaluator prepends the system instruction to the user content to preserve the same contract.

Structure extraction prompts. Structure evaluation uses two separate system prompts and format blocks, one for node labeling and one for link extraction.

#### Structure evaluation prompt contract

- STAGE 1 NODE LABELING

SYSTEM PROMPT You are a helpful assistant. You will be given a text and a graph structure (links

between nodes). Your task is to read the text and provide a concise label (single word or short phrase) for each node that best represents its meaning based on the text content. Output only valid JSON

with no extra text. Put your JSON after [Nodes]. FORMAT INSTRUCTION Output format: Put the JSON after [Nodes] [Nodes] {

"nodes": [

- { "id": "n1", "label": "Your Label for n1" },
- { "id": "n2", "label": "Your Label for n2" }

] }

- STAGE 2 LINK EXTRACTION

SYSTEM PROMPT You are a helpful assistant. Given the text and a list of nodes, identify the

relationships (links or edges) between these nodes based on the text. Each link should connect two nodes and optionally have a label describing the relationship. Output only valid JSON with no

extra text. Put your JSON after [Links]. FORMAT INSTRUCTION Output format: Put the JSON after [Links] [Links] {

"links": [

{ "source": "n1", "target": "n2", "label": "Link Label or empty" } ]

}

Provider specific behavior for structure evaluation. The structure evaluator includes optional streaming and extra request fields for provider specific features such as thinking mode. It also includes a fallback path that extracts reasoning content when the standard content field is empty for certain endpoints.

#### D.3. Open source model evaluation

Local HuggingFace models. For local evaluation, open source models are loaded via AutoTokenizer and AutoModelForCausalLM. We run deterministic generation and parse the answer using the same format contract as the API track.

OpenAI compatible providers for open source endpoints. In addition to local inference, we evaluate open source models served behind OpenAI compatible endpoints through a unified wrapper. This path supports:

- • streaming for endpoints that require incremental token delivery
- • retry and backoff for transient failures
- • resume support through per model per sample partial caches so interrupted runs can continue without repeating completed samples

Consistency across tracks. Across API and open source evaluations, we keep the same input text, the same question formatting, the same strict answer schema, and the same EM and F1 computation. This ensures that differences in scores primarily reflect model capability rather than evaluator artifacts.

### E. Sample Examples

#### E.1. Structure diagram examples

We visualize the diversity of structural topologies present in the T2S-Bench dataset. We provide representative diagrams from each of the six core scientific domains: Computer Science, Economics, Environmental Sciences, Life Sciences, Physical Sciences, and Social Sciences. These examples illustrate the wide range of visual structures—including sequential flows, feedback loops, and parallel hierarchies—that the model is required to extract and reason over.

#### E.2. Full sample examples

Here we present a complete instance of the dataset entries to demonstrate the full data format. For each sample, we show the input text paragraph extracted from the scientific paper, the ground-truth topology (node-link graph) derived from that text, and the corresponding multi-hop reasoning question (including the reasoning analysis plan and distractors).

% ===== Extracted context (excerpt) ===== ### 2. MemGPT (MemoryGPT) MemGPT’s OS-inspired multi-level memory architecture delineates between two primary

memory types: **main context** (analogous to main memory/physical memory/RAM) and

**external context** (analogous to disk memory/disk storage). (...) If this flag is present, MemGPT will add the function output to main context and (as

opposed to pausing processor execution). If this flag is not present (a *yield*), MemGPT will not run the LLM processor until the next external event trigger (e.g. a user message or scheduled interrupt).

### F. Additional Results and Analysis

In this section, we present the experimental setup, report comprehensive results across a diverse set of models and tasks, and discuss the novel insights derived from these findings.

#### F.1. Experimental Setting

Dataset. The T2S-Bench benchmark is built through a three-stage pipeline. First, we collect text–structure pairs by extracting diagrammatic structures from scientific papers, covering six major scientific domains—computer science, economics, environmental science, life science, physics and social science—across 33 sub-domains. Second, we construct a multi-hop reasoning (MR) multiple-choice dataset where each question requires reasoning over a graph with multiple nodes. These questions fall into four graph-reasoning categories and 32 templates. Third, we build an end-to-end (E2E) structure extraction task consisting of 88 human-verified samples. In this task the model must output a node–link graph given only the raw text; to fairly handle the one-to-many nature of structuring, we report separate NodeF1 and LinkF1 scores.

Splits and metrics. We use a training set of 1.2k instruction–answer pairs (T2S-Bench-Instruct-1.2K) to fine-tune structure-aware models, a multi-hop reasoning test set of 500 multiple-choice questions for evaluation, and an E2E test set of 88 samples for structure extraction. We measure Exact-Match (EM) and F1 on multiple-choice tasks, and NodeF1/LinkF1 on E2E tasks. For downstream generalisation, we also evaluate models on external long-context benchmarks (LongBench, Scrolls). When evaluating reasoning strategies we consider four inference schemes: vanilla prompting, chain-of-thought (CoT), structure-of-thought (SoT) and models fine-tuned on T2S-Bench (T2S-Train).

Models. Our study spans a wide spectrum of proprietary and open-source large language models. In total, we assess more than forty mainstream language models drawn from a broad cross-section of model families. These include proprietary giants such as Gemini-2.5-Pro, Gemini-2.5-Flash, Gemini-2.0 Flash and Flash-Lite (Team et al., 2023; Comanici et al., 2025), GPT-5, GPT-4o, and GPT-3.5 variants (Achiam et al., 2023; Singh et al., 2025; Brown et al., 2020), and multiple

Claude versions (The), open-source instruction-tuned models such as DeepSeek V3/R1/Chat (Guo et al., 2025; Liu et al., 2024), Qwen3 series (Yang et al., 2025), Kimi-K2 (Team et al., 2025), smaller baselines such as GLM-4.5/4.6, MiniMax-M2 and MiniMax-Text-01 (Zeng et al., 2025; Li et al., 2025), and mid-sized alternatives such as Mistral and LLaMA (Jiang et al., 2023; Touvron et al., 2023; Grattafiori et al., 2024) in a range of sizes and instruction variants. Each model receives identical prompts, random seeds and inference scripts to ensure a fair comparison across architectures, scales, and training paradigms.

Training Set We trained Qwen2.5-7b-Instruct and LLama3.1-8b-Instruct using the GRPO (Generalized Reinforcement Policy Optimization) algorithm. All experiments were conducted on a single node equipped with 8 A100 GPUs. Each model was fine-tuned for approximately 200 steps with a batch size of 32, using the veRL library for stable and scalable reinforcement learning. This setup ensures efficient parallel training while maintaining high-quality policy updates within a limited compute budget.

#### F.2. Additional Results

Tab. 6 and 7 present the performance of 45 evaluated models on the T2S-Bench-MR (multi-hop reasoning) and T2S-BenchE2E (end-to-end structuring) tasks, respectively, across various domains and task types.

##### F.3. Observation and Insight Based on these results, we can derive several key insights:

- 1. Structural understanding underpins reasoning performance. Across the hundreds of numbers in Table4, a clear positive correlation emerges between a model’s ability to extract nodes and links and its success on reasoning questions. The top three models—Gemini-2.5-Pro, Claude-sonnet and GPT-5.2—all achieve NodeF1 above 50 and LinkF1 above 77, and they simultaneously occupy the top three positions in overall QA accuracy. Conversely, architectures with very low NodeF1 (e.g., GLM-4.6, MiniMax-M2) also record the worst EM scores. This pattern holds across families: within Qwen models, the 235B variants with higher NodeF1 scores outperform their smaller counterparts on all reasoning categories. The observation underscores that explicit structural thinking—accurate identification of entities and relations—is not merely a side task but a fundamental prerequisite for effective graph-based reasoning.
- 2. Open-source models are catching up. Despite the impressive lead of proprietary giants, the gap is narrowing. Instruction-tuned open-source models like DeepSeek-reasoner (R1) and Qwen3-32B achieve EM scores above 69 and F1 above 83, rivalling GPT-5.2 on several categories. Even mid-sized models such as Mistral-Small-24B and Kimi-K2 surpass 65 EM with careful instruction tuning. These results highlight the effectiveness of publicly available training corpora and prompt engineering. Moreover, open models allow the research community to inspect intermediate outputs, enabling targeted error analyses that accelerate progress. Continued investment in open-source data curation and community collaboration will be key to closing the remaining performance gap.
- 3. Structure extraction remains the bottleneck. While overall QA scores for strong models approach 90 F1, NodeF1 lingers in the mid-50s and drops below 40 for many open-source systems. Even high-performing models like GPT-5.2 and DeepSeek-R1 achieve LinkF1 over 80 but stumble on node identification. The persistent gap between Node and Link scores underscores the complexity of entity segmentation and co-reference resolution. Without reliably finding the right set of nodes, relation extraction can only go so far, limiting the end-to-end utility of the generated structures. Future research must therefore prioritise techniques for robust entity extraction—be it through better pre-training, hybrid symbolic–neural approaches or integration of external structure annotations.
- 4. Scaling alone is insufficient. The table includes models ranging from 4 billion to over 400 billion parameters, yet performance is far from monotonic in size. Within the LLaMA family, the 70B instruct model outperforms the 405B variant by a wide margin (74.90 vs. 60.85 F1), and within Qwen, the 235B thinking model scores lower than the 32B instruct model on several categories. These inconsistencies suggest that data quality, training strategy, and architectural biases matter more than sheer scale for multi-hop reasoning. Merely scaling up parameters without targeted instruction tuning or structural inductive biases yields diminishing returns.
- 5. Reasoning skills are unevenly distributed. A closer look at per-category scores reveals that many models excel in only a subset of reasoning types. For example, Kimi-K2 and Mistral-Small-24B score above 80 EM on counterfactual reasoning but fall below 40 on fault localization, while GLM-4.5 displays the opposite pattern with relatively strong

- functional mapping but poor counterfactual reasoning. Such specialisation likely arises from differences in pre-training corpora and instruction mixtures. Bridging these gaps will require multi-task curricula that balance exposures across reasoning categories and encourage models to discover transferable abstractions.
- 6. Trade-offs between specialisation and generality. Several models in Table4 demonstrate that excelling in a single category does not guarantee strong overall performance. GLM-4.5 achieves 68.12 EM on functional mapping—higher than many larger models—but its overall EM is only 37.00. Conversely, Qwen3-Next-80B-Thinking attains a respectable NodeF1 of 42.58 yet flounders on multi-choice QA (24.40 EM). These discrepancies illustrate the difficulty of balancing the diverse skills required by T2S-Bench. Designing parameter-efficient fine-tuning schemes or modular networks that allow targeted improvements without catastrophic interference may help reconcile specialisation with general reasoning ability.
