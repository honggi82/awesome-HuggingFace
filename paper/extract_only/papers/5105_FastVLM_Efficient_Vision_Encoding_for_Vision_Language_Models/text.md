### Abstract

Scaling the input image resolution is essential for enhancing the performance of Vision Language Models (VLMs), particularly in text-rich image understanding tasks. However, popular visual encoders such as ViTs become inefficient at high resolutions due to the large number of tokens and high encoding latency. At different operational resolutions, the vision encoder of a VLM can be optimized along two axes: reducing encoding latency and minimizing the number of visual tokens passed to the LLM, thereby lowering overall latency. Based on a comprehensive efficiency analysis of the interplay between image resolution, vision latency, token count, and LLM size, we introduce FastVLM—a model that achieves an optimized tradeoff between resolution, latency, and accuracy. FastVLM incorporates FastViTHD, a novel hybrid vision encoder designed to output fewer tokens and significantly reduce encoding time for high-resolution images. Unlike previous methods, FastVLM achieves the optimal balance between visual token count and image resolution solely by scaling the input image, eliminating the need for additional token pruning and simplifying the model design. In the LLaVA1.5 setup, FastVLM achieves 3.2× improvement in time-tofirst-token (TTFT) while maintaining similar performance on VLM benchmarks compared to prior works. Compared to LLaVa-OneVision at the highest resolution (1152×1152), FastVLM achieves better performance on key benchmarks like SeedBench, MMMU and DocVQA, using the same 0.5B LLM, but with 85× faster TTFT and a vision encoder that is 3.4× smaller. Code and models are available at https: //github.com/apple/ml-fastvlm.

ing visual tokens from a pretrained vision backbone to a pretrained Large Language Model (LLM) through a projec-

tion layer. Previous works [53, 54] have explored various training and fine-tuning strategies for these three components: the vision backbone, the projection layer, and the LLM, which is typically a decoder-only transformer [84] model.

Several studies [28, 61, 66] highlight image resolution as a key factor in VLM performance, especially for text and chart-rich data. However, increasing image resolution presents multiple challenges. First, pretrained vision encoders may not support high-resolution images, as this would make pretraining inefficient. To address this, one approach is to continuously pretrain the vision backbone to adapt it for high resolutions [6]. Alternatively, tiling strategies, such as Sphinx [52], S2 [72], and AnyRes [53], divide images into subregions, with each subregion processed independently by the backbone.

A further challenge is the runtime computational cost associated with high-resolution inference. Both single highresolution inference and multiple inferences at lower resolution (the tiling strategy) result in significant latency when generating visual tokens. Additionally, high-resolution images naturally produce more tokens, which increases the LLM prefilling time (the LLM forward pass time on all tokens in the context, including visual tokens), thereby further increasing the time-to-first-token (TTFT), which is the sum of the vision encoder latency and the LLM prefilling time.

In this work, we study VLM design and training from a runtime efficiency perspective. We explore the optimization landscape as image resolution increases, aiming to improve accuracy-latency trade-off, where latency includes both the vision encoder inference time and the LLM prefilling time. Using extensive experiments with different LLM sizes and resolutions, we establish the Pareto optimal curve for a specific vision backbone, showing the best accuracy achievable within a given runtime budget (TTFT) based on different choices of resolution and LLM size.

We start by exploring the use of a hybrid convolutionaltransformer architecture FastViT [82], pretrained with MobileCLIP [83], as a vision backbone for the VLM setup (Section 3.1). We demonstrate the potential of this hybrid backbone, which generates visual tokens over 4× faster than a ViT model while achieving higher overall VLM accuracy with multi-scale features (Section 3.1.1).

However, further architectural optimization is possible when the primary goal is a high-resolution VLM (rather than embedding generation as in MobileCLIP-pretrained FastViT). We introduce a new hybrid vision encoder, FastViTHD, specifically designed for efficient VLM performance on high-resolution images (Section 3.2), and use it as the vision backbone to obtain FastVLM through visual instruction tuning. FastVLM demonstrates a significantly improved accuracy-latency trade-off over VLMs based on ViTs, convolutional encoders, and our previously

discussed hybrid FastViT for different input image resolutions and LLM sizes (Figure 1a, Figs. 1b and 4). In particular, FastVLM outperforms several prior works while being smaller, faster, and trained with less data (Table 6). Compared to LLaVA-OneVision [45] operating at the highest possible resolution (1152×1152), FastVLM obtains comparable performance with the same 0.5B LLM, but with 85× faster TTFT and a 3.4× smaller vision encoder.

The following is a summary of our contributions:

- • We show that hybrid vision backbones outperform ViTs in VLMs, and introduce additional architectural interventions, such as multi-scale vision features, to further improve VLM performance while maintaining efficiency.
- • We design and pretrain a new hybrid architecture, FastViTHD, optimized for efficient VLM performance with high resolution input for FastVLM. In a controlled experimental setup, where only the vision backbone is changed, we show that FastViTHD outperforms its ViTbased and convolution-based counterparts when used in VLMs: achieving 3.2× faster TTFT and 3.6× smaller size than SigLIP-SO400M [94], and 2.3× faster TTFT and 1.7× smaller size than ConvNeXT [28]. We further demonstrate that FastVLM scales effectively as more visual instruction tuning data becomes available.
- • We systematically study the VLM accuracy-latency tradeoff by considering both the vision backbone latency and the LLM prefilling time on actual hardware benchmarks. Our results demonstrate an improved resolution-latencyaccuracy trade-off achieved by FastVLM, measured ondevice rather than estimates.

### 2. Related Works

Large Multimodal Models. With the emergence of large language models [68, 77, 79, 86, 98] and large pretrained vision models, such as CLIP [69], trained on web-scale image-text datasets, several multimodal architectures have been proposed to encode images aligned with a large language model (LLM) to enable the interpretation of visual signals. Earlier works like Frozen [80] and Florence [1, 2] used a cross-attention mechanism where the image embeddings are fused with text embeddings in intermediate layers of the LLM. More recently, auto-regressive architectures have gained popularity where the image embedding is fed alongside text as input to an LLM. Some prominent works that use this architecture are LLaVA [53–55], mPLUG-Owl [88–90], InstructBLIP [20], BLIP-3 [85], SPHINX [52], MiniGPT-4 [99], VILA [50], MM1 [66], Qwen-VL [4], InternVL [15, 16] and Cambrian-1 [78]. Recently, Fuyu [5] and EVE [23] introduced a simplified architecture that passes raw images directly to the LLM decoder. Chameleon [76] introduced early fusion mixed-modal models where images are tokenized using a pretrained codebook. While skipping the image encoder is an intriguing

approach, the performance of this new class of models lags behind architectures that use a pretrained image encoder.

Efficient Image Encoding. CLIP [69] pretrained vision transformers [24] are widely used for encoding images in vision-language models, with popular choices including SigLIP [94], EVA-CLIP [75], InternViT [15] and DFNCLIP [26]. To enhance performance, recent works [36, 73, 78] employ ensembles of vision encoders trained with different objectives. These works are orthogonal to our work

- as they can benefit from using an efficient vision encoder among the ensemble of vision encoders. Since ViT-based architectures are a popular choice for VLMs, inefficiencies arise from the number of visual tokens outputted by the encoder, prompting methods like LLaVA-PruMerge [70] and Matryoshka-based token sampling [7, 32] to dynamically prune tokens. Other approaches [9, 18–20] reduce tokens using perceiver-style resamplers or pooling techniques. Rather than using an isotropic architecture like ViT and then designing custom resamplers and projectors, hierarchical architectures can be a simpler design choice. Hierarchical backbones like ConvNeXT [57] and FastViT [82] produce fewer tokens as they downsample the input tensor
- at every stage of compute. Recently, ConvLLaVA [28] was introduced that uses a pure-convolutional vision encoder to encode images for a VLM. In our work, we introduce an improved convolution-transformer hybrid architecture for VLMs and discuss the Pareto optimal operating points when this architecture is scaled to higher input resolutions.

### 3. Architecture

In this section, we first explore the adoption of the FastViT hybrid vision encoder for vision-language modeling. We then introduce architectural interventions to improve performance on VLM tasks. We present FastViTHD, a new hybrid vision encoder designed for an efficient high-resolution VLM. We provide comprehensive ablations to demonstrate the optimality of FastViTHD over FastViT and prior works for different LLMs and input resolutions. Figure 2 illustrates the overall architecture of FastVLM and FastViTHD. The training setup for all results in this section follows the same configuration as LLaVA-1.5 [53] with Vicuna-7B [98] as the LLM decoder, unless mentioned otherwise. See Sec. 4 for more details.

#### 3.1. FastViT as VLM Image Encoder

VLMs such as LLaVA have three main components: an image encoder, a vision-language projector, and a large language model (LLM). Both the performance and runtime efficiency of a VLM highly depend on its vision backbone. Encoding images at high resolution is essential for achieving strong performance across various VLM benchmarks, especially for text-rich tasks. Therefore, a vision encoder with scalable resolution is particularly beneficial for VLMs.

- Table 2. Pushing FastViT VLM performance using multi-scale features and pooling strategies. These modifications slightly improve FastViT. Training setup is LLaVA-1.5 with Vicuna 7B.

We identify hybrid vision encoders (convolutional layers followed by transformer blocks) as an ideal candidate for VLMs, as their convolutional component enables native resolution scaling, and their transformer blocks further refine high-quality visual tokens for consumption by the LLM.

We use a CLIP-pretrained hybrid vision encoder, specifically the MCi2 image encoder from MobileCLIP [83], which has 35.7M parameters and is based on the FastViT architecture. For simplicity, we refer to this encoder as “FastViT” throughout the rest of the paper. As shown in Tab. 1, using FastViT at its CLIP-pretrained resolution (256×256) alone does not yield a strong VLM. The main advantage of a hybrid encoder like FastViT lies in its favorable image resolution scaling characteristics, meaning it generates 5.2× fewer tokens than the ViT architecture with a patch size of 14. The token reduction gives significant advantage to VLMs, as it reduces the prefilling time and time-to-first-token (TTFT) of the transformer decoders. When the input resolution of FastViT is scaled to 768×768, it produces the same number of visual tokens as ViT-L/14 with an input resolution of 336×336 but achieves better performance on VLM benchmarks. This performance gap is even more pronounced on text-rich benchmarks like TextVQA and DocVQA, despite both architectures producing the same number of visual tokens. Moreover, even with the same token count at higher resolution, it encodes images much faster due to efficient convolution layers.

but this has drawbacks. From Fig. 3, simply scaling-up the number of self-attention layers in stages 3 and 4 of FastViT, as done in prior works, is suboptimal and slower than ConvNeXT-L. To mitigate this, we introduce an extra stage with a downsampling layer, ensuring self-attention operates on tensors downsampled by a factor of 32, rather than 16 as in recent models like ViTamin, see Fig. 2. More details on the naive scaling approach can be found in Sec.B. Our design reduces image encoding latency and generates 4× fewer tokens for the compute-intensive LLM decoder, thereby decreasing the time-to-first-token (TTFT). The architecture schematic is shown in Fig. 2, and we call this model FastViTHD.

The model architecture consists of 5 stages, as shown in Fig. 2, with the first three stages utilizing RepMixer [82] blocks and the last two stages employing multi-headed selfattention [24] blocks. The model depth at each stage is [2, 12, 24, 4, 2], and the embedding dimensions for each stage are [96, 192, 384, 768, 1536]. The MLP expansion ratio for the ConvFFN layers is set to 4.0. The model has 125.1M parameters, which is 3.5× larger than the largest FastViT variant from MobileCLIP, but is still smaller than popular ViT alternatives.

#### 3.2.FastViTHD:HighResolutionEncoderforVLM

While FastViT with the introduced model interventions performs well as an image encoder that is 8.7× smaller than ViT-L/14, previous studies [15, 47] have demonstrated that increasing the scale of the image encoder improves its generalization capabilities.

We follow the CLIP pretraining setup of [83] using the DataCompDR-1B dataset to pretrain FastViTHD before employing it for FastVLM training. Table 3 shows

Hybrid architectures [17, 92] typically scale the number of self-attention layers and width in a 4-stage design,

##### 3.2.1. Vision Encoder - Language Decoder Interplay

The accuracy-latency trade-off in a VLM is influenced by several factors. On one hand, the overall performance of the VLM depends on (1) the input image resolution, (2) the quantity and quality of visual tokens, and (3) the capability of the LLM. On the other hand, the total latency (time to

first token generation) of a VLM is determined by (1) the latency of the vision encoder and (2) the prefilling time of the LLM. The latter is affected by both the number of tokens produced by the vision encoder and the size of the LLM.

Due to the complex optimization landscape of VLMs, claims regarding the optimality of a vision encoder must be verified across various pairs of (Resolution, LLM). Here, we empirically demonstrate the optimality of FastViTHD over FastViT. For each vision encoder, we consider three LLMs, Qwen2 [86]-0.5B/1.5B/7B, along with a range of input image resolutions. For each (Resolution, LLM) pair, we conduct LLaVA-1.5 [53] pretraining and visual instruction tuning, and evaluate the resulting model over a range of tasks. The results are presented in Fig. 4.

First, we observe that for a vision encoder, the Paretooptimal curve (highlighted in Fig. 4), which represents the maximum achievable performance for a given runtime budget (TTFT), consists of varying sizes of LLMs. Specifically, pairing high resolution with a small LLM is suboptimal as a small LLM cannot effectively utilize that many tokens, and TTFT will be dominated by the latency of the vision

encoder (see Fig. 5).

Second, the Pareto-optimal curve for FastViTHD in Fig. 4 is significantly better than that of FastViT. For a given runtime budget, considering all possible (Resolution, LLM) pairs, we achieve significantly better performance (an improvement of over 2.5 points on the Average-5 metric) with FastViTHD. Similarly, FastViTHD can reach a target VLM performance up to 3× faster. It is important to note that in previous sections, we demonstrated that a FastViTbased VLM already represents a significant improvement over ViT-based VLMs, and yet FastViTHD provides substantial gains over FastViT.

##### 3.2.2. Static vs. Dynamic Input Resolution

There are two ways to scale input resolution: adjusting the model’s input resolution directly or tiling the image and setting the encoder’s resolution to the tile size. The tiled inference (AnyRes) was introduced in prior works [52, 54] to enable ViT models to process high resolution images. Since FastViTHD is designed to run inference efficiently on high input resolutions, we analyze the optimal operating point for various resolutions using the two strategies. From Fig. 6, we see that setting the model’s input resolution directly to the desired resolution offers the best accuracy-latency tradeoff, with dynamic resolution benefiting only at extreme resolutions like 1536×1536, due to memory bandwidth limitations. If dynamic resolution is desired, using a setting with fewer tiles exhibits better accuracy-latency tradeoff. Further discussion on this setup is presented in Sec. C.1.

##### 3.2.3.ComparisonwithTokenPruning&Downsampling

We further compare the performance of FastViTHD operating at different resolutions to popular token pruning methods in literature. From Tab. 5, we find that VLMs achieve better accuracy to latency trade-off using a hierarchical backbone as opposed to using token pruning methods on isotropic architectures like ViT. By simply training the VLMs at lower input resolution, FastViTHD achieves visual token counts as low as 16, while improving over recent token pruning methods. Interestingly, even the most effective token pruning methods, such as those proposed by [7, 32, 33, 87], perform worse than FastViTHD trained at a lower input resolution of 256×256.

### 4. Experiments

Training Setup. For all the ablations presented in Sec. 3, we follow the 2-stage setup described in LLaVA-1.5 [53] with Vicuna-7B [98] as the LLM decoder, unless mentioned otherwise. During the first stage, only the projector is trained using LLaVA-558K alignment dataset for one epoch, with a batch size of 256 and a learning rate of 10−3. At this stage, the input image resolution matches the backbone pretraining resolution (e.g., 256 for FastViT and 224

for FastViTHD). In the second stage, we use LLaVA-665K supervised finetuning dataset, training the models for one epoch and tuning all the modules, i.e., vision encoder, projector and the LLM. At this stage, the input image resolution is set to the target resolution.

In Sec. 4, we present results with different LLM decoders, primarily with Qwen2-0.5B/1.5B/7B model family [86] (chat variant) and Vicuna-7B model [98]. We report results in two training setups, the first one is the 2-Stage setup introduced in LLaVA-1.5. For the second training setup, we follow the current trend in literature [43, 66] of training the VLMs in 3 stages, i.e. Stage 1 for training the connector, Stage 1.5 for resolution scaling and Stage 2 for visual instruction tuning. Information on datasets used in these stages can be found in Sec.D. In this setup, the input image resolution is set to the backbone pretraining resolution for Stage 1 and adjusted to the target resolution for the following two stages. In both setups, the vision encoder and LLM are frozen only in stage 1, while all modules are finetuned in the remaining stages. For the best setup, we further finetune the model from Stage 2 with high quality instruction tuning dataset with chain-of-thought reasoning from [30] and call this Stage 3. Details of this setup is elaborated in Sec. A and Sec. D. We publicly release R4, R12, and R41 checkpoints from Stage 2 training, as well as the

For the dataset column, “-” indicates that the dataset size for pretraining (“PT”) or instruction tuning (“IT”) is not explicitly mentioned in the respective paper. For methods that have more than 2 stages of training, we report the total samples used for all the pretraining stages as part of “PT”. “TTFT” means time to first token (the sum of the vision encoder latency and the LLM prefilling time), we report latency only for models that are publicly available and in a format favorable to MLX [31] “Vic.” refers to Vicuna [98], “Qw.2” refers to Qwen2 [86] and “Qw.” refers to Qwen [3]. “L-2” refers to LLaMA-2. “L-3” refers to LLaMA-3. “ML.” refers to MobileLLaMA [18, 19]. “DS.” refers to DeepSeek LLM [21]. ∗ For input resolution and visual tokens, we report the highest supported resolution by the respective models as some models like LLaVA-OneVision [45] and MM1 [66] use dynamic input resolution. FastVLM models using dynamic resolution employs a simple 2×2 grid, with tile size set to 1024. †- performance numbers reported from [78]. For VLMs that use multiple vision encoders, the size of each encoder is listed independently, for TTFT, the latency from each encoder is summed up.

R5, R13, and R42 checkpoints from Stage 3 training, as part of our open-sourced codebase.

All FastVLM models reported in the paper are trained on a single node with 8× NVIDIA H100-80GB GPUs. Stage 1 training of VLM is quick, taking roughly 30 minutes to train with a Qwen2-7B decoder. Stage 1.5 and Stage 2 training runs are dependent on input resolution. For an input resolution of 1024×1024, Stage 1.5 takes 77 hours and Stage 2 takes 8 hours. The reported wall clock times correspond to the following datasets used in these stages: 15 million samples in Stage 1.5 and 1.1 million samples in Stage 2.

Evaluation. We evaluate the models on the mainstream benchmarks of GQA [34], ScienceQA [59], TextVQA [74], POPE [48], LLaVA-in-the-wild [54], VQAv2 [29], MMVet [91], MMMU [93], DocVQA [65] and SeedBench [42]. For GQA, ScienceQA, TextVQA, POPE and LLaVA-in-the-wild benchmarks, we use the official evaluation from LLaVA [54]. For the remaining evaluations we use lmms-eval [96] library v0.2.2. We use the default settings for all the evaluations and lmms-eval defaults to 0613 version of GPT for evaluations that rely on GPT as a judge.

For ablations presented in Sec. 3, we report GQA, TextVQA, POPE, DocVQA and SeedBench. GQA and SeedBench are general knowledge benchmarks, DocVQA and TextVQA represent text-rich evaluations and POPE is a hallucination benchmark. Together these benchmarks provide diversity and are quick to evaluate for ablations. Most importantly, they exhibit lower variance to different initializations and under probabilistic decoding setting. We report the variance for all the evals for different initialization in Sec. D.3. The standard deviation across the 5 selected metrics is less than 0.5. We call the average of these 5 benchmarks Avg-5, and use it as a reliable signal for our analysis. The empirical standard deviation estimate for Avg-5 is 0.1.

Benchmarking. We benchmark all the models on a MacBook Pro with the M1 Max chip and 32GB RAM. The image encoder is converted to a Core ML package file using coremltools v7.2 and benchmarked on the neural engine using XCode 15.4 (15F31d). The LLM is benchmarked on the MacBook Pro GPU using MLX [31]. The model is first converted using mlx lm.convert tool, which converts the models on huggingface to the MLX format and casts the tensors to FP16. The prefilling latency is estimated using mlx lm.cache prompt tool [31]. Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) is estimated by adding the image encoding latency at a specific resolution to the LLM prefilling latency for the associated visual tokens.

#### 4.1. Comparison with state-of-the-art

In Tab. 6, we compare FastVLM with recently published methods. The training setup can vary widely between works. For each, we report the LLM decoder and the sizes

of the instruction tuning and pretraining datasets used to train the respective VLMs, to facilitate a fair comparison.

Hierarchical Backbones. When we compare FastVLM (R20) with ConvLLaVA [28] (R18), with the same LLM and similar training data size, our model obtains +8.4% better performance on TextVQA and +12.5% better performance on DocVQA while being 22% faster. The gap widens at higher resolution, where FastVLM (R28 and R29) achieves superior performance on wide range of benchmarks while being 2× faster than ConvLLaVA (R26), with the same LLM decoder.

Dataset Scaling. When scaling the pretraining dataset by incorporating an intermediate pretraining stage for resolution scaling with 15M samples, FastVLM (R21) matches or surpasses MM1 [66] (R38) across a wide range of benchmarks. Remarkably, FastVLM achieves this performance while generating 5× fewer visual tokens. With an input resolution of 1024×1024 and a larger instruction tuning dataset of size 12.5M, FastVLM (R41) outperforms MM1 (R38) and LLaVA-NeXT (R39) across various benchmarks, including text-rich evaluations, like TextVQA and DocVQA, which are sensitive to input resolution and number of visual tokens. The gap widens when further scale up input resolution using AnyRes, more details in Sec. C.1. We provide details of the dataset splits in Sec. D.

Multiple Vision Encoders. Recently, MiniGemini [49] and Cambrian-1 [78] introduced models that rely on multiple vision encoders. In Tab. 6, we compare FastVLM (R40), which uses a single vision encoder with methods that use multiple encoders and trained on similarly scaled visual instruction tuning dataset. In Cambrian-1 [78] (R44), vision encoding contributes 3.2× more than LLM prefilling to the total time-to-first-token of approximately 5 seconds (detailed breakdown is provided in Tab. 10). FastVLM (R40) outperforms Cambrian-1 (R44) when trained on a similar visual instruction tuning dataset, while being 7.9× faster. By scaling the instruction tuning dataset to 12.5M, FastVLM (R41) achieves superior performance over Cambrian-1 (R44) with 2.3× fewer visual tokens, even on text-rich evaluations (see Tab. 11) that are sensitive to the number of visual tokens.

Effect of Decoder. VLM performance also depends on the quality of LLM, as demonstrated in prior studies, like [44]. By switching from Vicuna-7B (R21, R29) to Qwen2 [77, 86] models (R22, R30), we see improvement in performance across all the benchmarks. The improvements are significant on MMVet, LLaVA-in-the-wild and MMMU benchmarks. With Qwen2-0.5B as the LLM decoder, FastVLM (R4) outperforms LLaVA-OneVision [45] (R2) while being 85× faster. This result underscores the quality of our vision encoder, as both models use the same LLM decoder, while FastViTHD is 3.4× smaller compared to SigLIP-SO400M [94].

- Table 7. Comparison with concurrent works. Models are ordered in the descending order of the number of visual tokens. The number of visual tokens listed for each model is based on the highest supported input resolution for the respective models. ∗ - For the number of visual tokens generated by SmolVLM2, we estimated it based on the model configs as there is no explicit mention of this information in the paper. The reported visual tokens correspond to the highest resolution supported by the respective model. † - models are evaluated using VLMEvalKit [25]. The rest of the models are evaluated using lmms-eval [96] library. The FastVLM model used in this table is R5 and R13 from Tab. 6

Concurrent works. In Tab. 7, we compare FastVLM with concurrent works like SmolVLM2 [62] and FlorenceVL [11]. FastVLM (R7) performs competitively against SmolVLM2 (R3), particularly on text-rich evaluations such as ChartQA and TextVQA, while surpassing it on the DocVQA and InfoVQA benchmarks. FastVLM (R7) accomplishes this using 8.2× fewer visual tokens than SmolVLM2 (R3). Additionally, FastVLM (R7) outperforms FlorenceVL (R6) on benchmarks such as TextVQA and DocVQA, while using 2.3× fewer visual tokens and a 6.2× smaller vision encoder. On knowledge based evaluations like AI2D and ScienceQA, FastVLM (R7) outperforms all other competing models. At the smallest scale, FastVLM (R2) outperforms a similar sized SmolVLM2 model (R1) on a wide range of benchmarks while using

- 4.3× fewer visual tokens.
- 5. Conclusion

In this work, we introduced FastVLM, which leverages the FastViTHD vision backbone for efficient encoding of highresolution inputs. FastViTHD has a hybrid architecture, is pretrained on reinforced image-text data, and outputs a substantially reduced number of visual tokens with minimal accuracy sacrifice. FastVLM has competitive performance with prior works across a wide range of VLM benchmarks while improving efficiency in both time-to-first-token and the number of parameters in the vision backbone. Rigorous benchmarking on an M1 MacBook Pro demonstrates that FastVLM achieves a state-of-the-art resolution-latencyaccuracy trade-off compared to existing works.

## FastVLM: Efficient Vision Encoding for Vision Language Models Supplementary Material

### A. Training Setup

For experiments presented in Tab. 1, Tab. 2, Tab. 4, Tab. 5, we perform 2-stage training with the hyperparameters listed in Tab. 8. The model is trained for a single epoch in all the stages. Note, in Tab. 5, we do not re-train other token pruning works, we simply report the performance of the respective methods as they adhere to the 2-stage training setup described in Tab. 8, which was originally introduced in LLaVA-1.5 [53].

To showcase our model’s performance in the presence of additional dataset, we scale both pretraining and instruction tuning datasets in Sec. 4. For results presented in R15, R19, R20, R27, R28 in Tab. 6, we still perform 2-stage training described in Tab. 8, for R20 and R28, we use instruction tuning dataset of size 1.1 million samples in Stage-2. For results presented in R3, R4, R7, R8, R11, R12, R16, R21, R22, R23, R29, R30, R40 and R41 we scale-up both instruction tuning dataset and pretraining dataset. We also introduce and additional stage of pretraining with the scaledup dataset as described in Tab. 9. Details of 1.1 million, 6.5 million and 12.5 million instruction tuning dataset is presented in Sec.D. For results presented in R5, R13 and R42, we introduce additional finetuning on high quality instruction tuning dataset from [30] in Stage 3. We publicly release R4, R12, and R41 checkpoints from Stage 2 training, as well as the R5, R13, and R42 checkpoints from Stage 3 training, as part of our open-sourced codebase.

### B. Architecture Details

The patch embedding layers shown in Fig. 2, consists of 7×7 depthwise convolutions with [81] style train-time overparameterization, followed by 1×1 pointwise convolution. The stride for 7×7 depthwise convolution is set to 2 in order to downsample the input tensor. In [83], squeeze-excite layers were incorporated into this block; however, we found

high image resolutions, so we opted not to include them in our model. We use the same ConvFFN layer defined in [82], i.e. 7×7 depthwise convolutions preceding a typical FFN layer. The stem downsamples the input tensor by factor of 4 on each side, and each patch embedding layer downsamples the input tensor by a factor 2. Although recent architectures like ViTamin [12] recommend an overall downsampling factor of only 16, FastViTHD incorporates an additional patch embedding layer compared to FastViT, resulting in an overall downsampling factor of 64× for the input tensor. In each stage, we increase the number of channels by a factor of 2 as done in FastViT and other convolutional and hybrid transformer architectures. This results in a Stage-5 with the widest MLP layers in the architecture, performing self-attention on an input tensor which is downsampled by a factor of 64.

#### B.1. Naive Scaling

In order to scale the model size of FastViT, we simply increased the embedding dimensions per stage to [128, 256, 512, 1024], and set the number of layers per stage to [2, 12, 16, 6]. Patch embedding layers in each stage use squeeze-excite layers and the MLP expansion ratio is set to 3.0, following the design in [83].

### C. Additional Results

We present the performance of FastVLM on text-rich benchmarks under various training settings in Tab. 11. FastVLM surpasses MM1 and Cambrian-1 across a wide range of benchmarks by scaling up pretraining and instruction tuning datasets. This result highlights the quality of visual tokens produced by FastViTHD, as FastVLM is able to achieve these improvements with 2.8× less visual tokens than MM1 and with a vision encoder that is 5.1× smaller.

- Table 10. Breakdown of prefilling latencies for recent methods. The models are grouped based on total number of visual tokens. For models that were difficult to export or unavailable, we mark them as ’-’ in the table. “Vic.” refers to Vicuna [98], “Qw.2” refers to Qwen2 [86] and “Qw.” refers to Qwen [3]. “L-2” refers to LLaMA-2. “L-3” refers to LLaMA-3. “ML.” refers to MobileLLaMA [18, 19]. “DS.” refers to DeepSeek LLM [21]. ∗ For input resolution and visual tokens, we report the highest supported resolution by the respective models as some models like LLaVA-OneVision [45] and MM1 [66] use dynamic input resolution. FastVLM models using dynamic resolution employs a simple 2×2 grid, with tile size set to 1024. For VLMs that use multiple vision encoders, the size of each encoder is listed independently, for TTFT, the latency from each encoder is summed up.

#### C.1. Dynamic Resolution (AnyRes) Results

From Fig. 6, it is evident that VLMs prefer visual encoding with fewer semantic breaks. Variants with more tiles typically underperform compared to those with fewer tiles and a static resolution. To scale up input resolution, we train variants of FastVLM with support for dynamic input resolution, where we use a tile size of 1024×1024 and use a simple 2×2 grid. This enables the model to process a peak input resolution of 2048×2048 using only 4 tiles, unlike models like InternVL2 [16] which uses roughly 36 tiles to process images of resolution 2688×2688. We report performance of FastVLM (R4, R5, R9, R10, R27, R28) with dynamic resolution support on text-rich benchmarks in Tab. 11.

#### C.2. CVBench and MathVista Results

Results in Tab. 12 show that, in comparison to Cambrian1 [78], FastVLM is significantly better on MathVista [60] and competitive on CVBench [78], even though we have a single backbone and significantly fewer tokens. Results on both CVBench and MathVista benchmarks further improve as we scale the SFT dataset by including LLaVAOneVision [45].

We further scale up this dataset by including training splits of the following datasets; AI2D [37], ScienceQA [59], ChartQA [63], COCO [51], DocVQA [65], DVQA [35], GeoQA+ [8], OCRVQA [67], SegmentAnything [39], SynthDoG-EN [38], TextVQA [74] and Visual Genome [40]. The conversational data for the listed datasets is sourced from [15]. The total number of samples in this dataset is 1.1 million and is referred to as “1.1M” in all the tables. We further scale-up instruction tuning dataset using image-based conversational data from Cambrian-7M [78], which amounts to 5.4 million samples. Filtered Cambrian-7M [78] is merged with “1.1M ” dataset to obtain “6.5M” instruction tuning dataset. We

- then append all available single-image instruction tuning data open-sourced by LLaVA-OneVision [45] to “6.5M” to obtain “11.9M” instruction tuning dataset. We then include roughly 0.6M samples from DocMatix [41] dataset to obtain “12.5M” instruction tuning dataset. From Tab. 6, we see further improvements in VLM benchmarks when instruction tuning dataset is scaled, following trends exhibited by image encoders much bigger than FastViTHD. The best performing models are achieved when Stage 2 models are further fine-tuned on the MammothVL instruction tuning dataset [30]. Specifically, we filter the corpus to include only single-image instruction tuning data, resulting in “10.6M” samples.

- D.3. Evaluations

In addition to evaluations listed in Sec. 4, we report performance of FastVLM on ChartQA [63], OCRBench [56] and InfoVQA [64] to compare FastVLM against recent methods on text-rich benchmarks. In Tab. 13, report performance of FastViT model (with architectural interventions) from multiple training runs and compute the standard deviation of metrics reported in Tab. 6. As described in Sec. 4, for ablations we are interested in benchmarks that are quick to evaluate and exhibit lower variance to different initializations. From Tab. 13, GQA, TextVQA, POPE, DocVQA and SeedBench fit the criteria. While VQAv2 also exhibits lower variance it is substantially larger and takes long time to evaluate. The standard deviation across the selected metrics is below 0.5, so we use the average of these metrics as a reliable indicator for our analysis in Sec. 3.

too small, simply using higher input resolution can reduce errors as shown in Tab. 15. Some cases require broader general knowledge to obtain a correct response as seen in Tab. 14, in such cases using a bigger LLM reduces failures. Some cases require reasoning about a higher resolution image, in which case using a bigger LLM can decrease failures as seen in Tab. 16. Some failures result from misjudgment, where correct responses are misclassified by the LLM judge or incorrect labels, we ignore these cases in our analysis.

We analyzed failures across benchmarks and found: In textrich benchmarks (e.g., DocVQA, ChartQA), failures occur when text is too small or precise alignment is needed (e.g., reading tables). In majority of cases where the text is
