Abstract. Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) are an essential format for technical illustration and digital design, offering precise resolution independence and flexible semantic editability. In practice, however, original vector source files are frequently lost or inaccessible, leaving only “flat” rasterized versions (e.g., PNG or JPEG) that are difficult to modify or scale. Manually reconstructing these figures is a prohibitively labor-intensive process, requiring specialized expertise to recover the original geometric intent. To bridge this gap, we propose VFig, a family of Vision–Language Models trained for complex and high-fidelity figure-to-SVG conversion. While this task is inherently data-driven, existing datasets are typically smallscale and lack the complexity of professional diagrams. We address this by introducing VFig-Data, a large-scale dataset of 66K high-quality figure–SVG pairs, curated from a diverse mix of real-world paper figures and procedurally generated diagrams. Recognizing that SVGs are composed of recurring primitives and hierarchical local structures, we introduce a coarse-to-fine training curriculum that begins with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to learn atomic primitives and transitions to reinforcement learning (RL) refinement to optimize global diagram fidelity, layout consistency, and topological edge cases. Finally, we introduce VFig-Bench, a comprehensive evaluation suite with novel metrics designed to measure the structural integrity of complex figures. VFig achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source models and performs on par with GPT-5.2, achieving a VLM-Judge score of 0.829 on VFig-Bench.

### 1 Introduction

Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) serve as a cornerstone of technical illustration and digital design, offering resolution independence, semantic editability, and a text-based structure amenable to both human editing and machine generation, all within a W3C-standard format supported by modern browsers and major graphics editors. From scientific research and engineering to education, design, and media, SVG figures distill complex ideas, processes, and relationships into precise visual forms that shape how concepts are understood and remembered. For instance, widely recognized architectures in AI such as ResNet [9] and Transformers [26] are often recalled through their canonical diagrams. Such figures are often structurally complex, combining nested layouts, heterogeneous primitives, precise alignments, and intricate connectivity that together convey meaning no single element could express alone. Yet in practice, original vector source files are frequently lost or inaccessible, leaving only flat rasterized versions (e.g., PNG or JPEG) that are difficult to modify, scale, or re-purpose. Manually reconstructing these figures is prohibitively labor-intensive, demanding specialized expertise to faithfully recover the original geometric intent, styling, and compositional structure.

Automating the conversion from a rasterized complex image back to editable clean SVG code—bridging the visual and textual modalities—would therefore unlock significant practical value: accelerating revision workflows, lowering the barrier to professional visualization, and enabling faithful reuse across platforms. A central challenge, however, is that this task requires joint reasoning over both visual content (e.g., spatial layouts, styling, and compositional hierarchy) and the structured code needed to faithfully reproduce it. This naturally lends itself to a vision-language modeling formulation, and we therefore propose a VLM-based approach that takes a raster image as input and produces a structured, editable SVG code. An overview of our method is shown in Fig. 1.

- Fig. 1: Overview of VFig. Given complex raster images (top row) as input, VFig generates editable, high-fidelity SVG code (pink box). Rendering the generated SVG (bottom row) produces outputs nearly indistinguishable from the inputs.

Despite growing interest in figure-to-SVG generation, no prior work has systematically studied whether modern machine learning models can produce high-fidelity, editable SVG code for structurally complex figures. Existing approaches span classical contour-tracing methods [24, 27], learning-based techniques [3, 13, 20], and more recent LLM/VLM-based generation methods [21,23,33,34,36]. While these methods have shown promising results, they are predominantly developed and evaluated on relatively simple graphics such as icons or small diagrams. It remains unclear how well they scale to the kind of figures encountered in practice, such as those with multi-panel layouts, dense annotations, hierarchical grouping, and precise connectivity, which are precisely the figures where automated reconstruction would be most valuable.

Complex figure-to-SVG generation poses several concrete technical challenges. First, not all visual content is well-suited for vectorization: natural images, heavy textures, and complex mathematical equations often demand dense low-level primitives that resist clean SVG representation, necessitating careful data curation. Second, as diagram complexity increases, SVG token sequences grow dramatically, making long-horizon generation and syntactic consistency substantially harder. Third, compositional figures, with repeated modules, hierarchical groupings, and precise alignments, are difficult to learn from a cold start compared to isolated icons. Finally, fine-grained geometric and stylistic details are hard to reproduce purely through token prediction without visual feedback. We address these challenges with the following contributions:

Data. We construct VFig-Data, a large-scale dataset of 66K complex figure–SVG pairs curated from real-world paper figures and procedurally generated diagrams. Our pipeline explicitly (1) excludes figures fundamentally unsuitable for faithful vectorization (e.g., natural images or mathematical equations), (2) preserves structural semantics and editability to support compositional learning, and (3) controls sequence length to reduce longhorizon generation instability.

Training. To address the compositional difficulty of complex figures and the limitations of pure next-token supervision, we propose a two-stage training strategy tailored to structured SVG generation. We first apply a coarse-to-fine curriculum during supervised fine-tuning (SFT), stabilizing primitive-level generation before scaling to multi-panel, hierarchical compositions. We then apply reinforcement learning (RL) with renderingaware, structure-focused rewards that provide explicit visual feedback on alignment, grouping, connectivity, and layout.

Evaluation. We introduce VFig-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark built on VFig-Data’s held-out split, specifically targeting complex figures. Unlike prior work that relies on a single evaluation axis, VFig-Bench

[Figure 17]

- Fig. 2: Examples of VFig-Data and academic data. We show the three sources: simple diagrams from academic datasets, complex diagram layouts, and a curated set of basic shapes and arrows to support structured SVG generation.

features a novel coarse-to-fine evaluation protocol that assesses generation quality across three complementary granularities: pixel-level metrics (e.g., LPIPS [38]) for low-level visual fidelity, component-level scores (e.g., rule-based arrow and shape matching) for structural correctness, and image-level judgments (e.g., Gemini [7] and GPT [17]-based evaluation) for holistic compositional quality. This multi-granularity design provides a comprehensive and nuanced picture of model capabilities that no single metric can capture alone.

Experiments. We train a family of VLMs for figure-to-SVG conversion and conduct a systematic empirical study organized around four research questions:(1) How well can current VLMs convert complex figures into faithful, editable SVG code? (2) Does coarse-to-fine curriculum SFT improve learning of compositional figure generation? (3) Does RL-based visual feedback improve structural fidelity and fine-grained detail reproduction? (4) At what granularity of visual feedback, pixel-level reconstruction versus higher-level structural judgment, does RL optimization yield the greatest gains?

Our experiments yield several clear findings: coarse-to-fine curriculum SFT consistently improves compositional stability, RL with visual feedback further enhances geometric fidelity, and structure-aware VLM-based judging signals prove substantially more effective than low-level pixel metrics for optimizing complex diagrams. Notably, VFig achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source models and competitive performance with substantially larger proprietary systems such as GPT-5.2, reaching a VLM-Judge score of 0.829 on VFigBench. This demonstrates that targeted data curation, structured training, and task-specific evaluation can narrow the performance gap with scale. Together, these findings establish a principled foundation for advancing VLM-based complex figure-to-SVG generation.

### 2 VFig-Data

To enable realistic figure-to-SVG generation for complex scientific diagrams, we curate VFig-Data, a large-scale dataset of 66K rigorously filtered image-SVG pairs. Unlike prior SVG datasets that focus predominantly on icons or decorative graphics, VFig-Data targets diagram-centric scientific figures and we visualized representative examples in Fig. 2. To our knowledge, VFig-Data is the first dataset of this scale purpose-built for structured scientific figure generation. In the following, we describe our data generation pipeline (Sec. 2.1) and our rigorous filtering procedure (Sec. 2.2). To further improve performance and generalization, we also incorporate 78K data points from academic SVG datasets after applying a similar filtering process (Sec. 2.3). Lastly, we provide a statistical analysis of the entire training data mixture (Sec. 2.4).

- Fig. 3: Data generation and filtering pipelines. We show the data generation and filtering processes for curated academic figures, complex diagrams created through a VLM-based describe-and-generate pipeline from crawled images, and shapes and arrows produced by LLM-generated templates with randomized elements.

#### 2.1 Data Generation

Specifically, VFig-Data contains two complementary subsets: (1) VFig-Data-Complex-Diagrams: real-world scientific paper figures collected as raster images and converted into structured SVG (Fig. 2, center), and (2) VFig-Data-Shapes-and-Arrows: programmatically generated diagrams featuring diverse shapes, connectors, and spatial layouts (Fig. 2, right). We develop a dedicated data pipeline for each source, detailed below.

VFig-Data-Complex-Diagrams. Scientific papers represent the richest and most diverse source of complex diagrams, encompassing flowcharts, architecture diagrams, process illustrations, and multi-panel figures with varied visual vocabularies. Leveraging this naturally occurring data allows us to capture the full complexity and stylistic diversity of real-world figures, which would be difficult to replicate through synthetic generation alone. However, these figures are predominantly distributed as raster images (PNG/JPG), necessitating their conversion into high-quality, semantically structured SVG code. Directly prompting a VLM to generate SVG in a single pass often yields incomplete structures, imprecise layouts, or path-heavy outputs that lack semantic organization. To address this, we design a two-stage generation pipeline (Fig. 3, center).

In the first step, we prompt a VLM to produce a structured description of the input figure, capturing geometric elements, textual content, spatial layout, and inter-object relationships. This intermediate representation decomposes the figure into semantic components that closely mirror SVG primitives. In the second step, we prompt the VLM again to generate SVG code conditioned on both the original image and the structured description. We empirically find that this two-step approach substantially improves layout accuracy, text rendering, and shape selection compared to single-pass generation. To select the optimal VLM backbone, we qualitatively evaluate over 20 VLMs in an internal sandbox through side-by-side comparisons of rendered outputs. Based on a human preference study, a unified Gemini-3-Pro pipeline—using Gemini-3-Pro for both the description and generation stages—is preferred in 88.7% of pairwise comparisons and is adopted as our final configuration (details in Appendix).

VFig-Data-Shapes-and-Arrows. Despite strong overall performance of above generation pipeline, we observe systematic errors in fine-grained attributes such as arrow styles, fonts, fill patterns, and certain geometric variations. These properties are difficult to reliably infer from raster images alone and are often weakly captured by automatic evaluation metrics.

To address this limitation, we construct VFig-Data-Shapes-and-Arrows, a programmatically generated dataset of diagrams with precise control over visual attributes (Fig. 2, right). Diagrams are synthesized directly in SVG using 19 layout templates and their combinations, where shapes, arrows, fonts, and styles are instantiated with randomized parameters to produce diverse yet structurally valid outputs. Each generated SVG is rendered into a raster image to form paired image–SVG training data. Because the diagrams are constructed programmatically, all visual attributes are recorded as structured metadata, providing precise and noise-free supervision; additional details are provided in Appendix.

Elements A, B, and C correspond to the highlighted code segments, preserving semantic structure while avoiding path-heavy SVGs.

#### 2.2 Data Filtering

To ensure high-quality training data, we apply two rigorous filters: (1) image filtering, which removes figures unsuitable for vectorization, and (2) Code filtering, which discards outputs dominated by free-form paths that cause token explosion due to verbose coordinate definitions. We provide more details about filtering in Appendix. Image Filtering. In image filtering, we remove figures dominated by natural images, screenshots, or math equations (which are better represented in LATEX), as well as plots and tables. We use Gemini-3 Flash (preview) to classify each figure into one of four categories: KEEP, IMAGE, MATH, and PLOT. We retain only figures classified as KEEP (diagram-centric figures) and discard the rest. We apply this filtering to both newly collected arXiv figures and the Paper2Fig [22] figures to obtain clean, diagram-centric samples for VFig-Data-Complex-Diagrams.

Code Filtering. Beyond image-level filtering, we apply SVG code filtering to remove <path>-dominated or structurally noisy outputs and retain figures composed of semantically meaningful primitives. We prioritize reducing <path> elements for two reasons: (1) they often contain extremely long coordinate sequences with excessive floating-point precision, leading to prohibitive token counts under a VLM’s tokenizer; and (2) they frequently bundle semantically distinct elements into monolithic definitions, hindering downstream editability. While recent models [36] demonstrate the ability to process SVG sequences exceeding 10K tokens, we argue that replacing free-form paths with geometric primitives (e.g., <rect>, <circle>) where possible substantially reduces sequence length without sacrificing expressiveness, yielding more efficient and semantically transparent representations.

Concretely, we filter the SVG code using a ratio-based heuristic that retains diagrams dominated by structural primitives while removing path-heavy artistic SVGs. We group SVG elements into three categories: basic shapes (rect, circle, ellipse), connectors (line, polyline), and complex shapes (path, polygon). Let the total number of geometric elements be the sum of these three groups. We enforce two rules: (1) the proportion of basic shapes and connectors must be at least 40% of all geometric elements, and (2) the absolute number of complex shapes must not exceed 50. These rules filter out tracing-style SVGs dominated by long path sequences while preserving diagram-style figures composed of simple geometric primitives. We further apply light cleaning to reduce syntactic noise including removing redundant metadata, standardizing canvas settings, and normalizing coordinate precision without affecting visual fidelity. Corrupted samples with abnormal repeated numeric or character patterns are discarded.

#### 2.3 Academic Data

Besides our own data, we also mix in publicly available SVG diagram resources in our training mixture. Specifically, StarVector [21] introduces SVG-Diagrams, a dataset specifically designed for structured diagram generation. It is constructed by filtering SVG files that contain <text> elements, thereby focusing on layouts composed of discrete primitives such as <rect>, <text>, and arrows rather than free-form artistic paths.

We additionally incorporate SVG diagram data from Molmo2-SynMultiImageQA [4] to further strengthen primitive-aware generation. However, these datasets are relatively limited in scale and domain diversity compared to real-world diagrams.

#### 2.4 Training Mixture & Statistics

- Table 1 summarizes the four data sources used in our model training: two from existing datasets – SVGDiagrams [21] and Molmo2-Diagram (a diagram-focused subset of Molmo2-SynMultiImageQA [4])—and two newly introduced by us – VFig-Data-Complex-Diagrams and VFig-Data-Shapes-and-Arrows. We also define and report metrics that quantify SVG’s complexity and cleanliness: Structural Complexity measures the overall structural burden of an SVG, reflecting how difficult it may be to model long-range layout and compositional structure; Element Complexity captures figure density by counting geometric and text elements (log-scaled), with higher values indicating more objects and annotations; SVG Cleanliness measures the proportion of semantic primitives and connectors (e.g., rect, circle, line) among all geometric elements, where higher is better for editability and learning; Path Dominance quantifies reliance on tracing-style elements (e.g., path, polygon), where lower values indicate less path-heavy, more structured SVG code. Formal definitions of these metrics can be found in Appendix.

### 3 VFig Model

Given an input figure image x ∈ X, the goal is to generate a structured SVG program y ∈ Y that reconstructs the visual content while preserving the semantic and compositional structure of the diagram. Our training data consists of paired figure–SVG examples D = {(xi,yi)}Ni=1, where each input figure is rendered directly from its ground-truth SVG code to ensure exact visual–structural alignment. Given an input figure and a simple prompt, i.e., “Generate the SVG for this figure”, the model is trained to produce the corresponding SVG code. To achieve faithful figure-to-SVG generation, we propose training VFig with supervised fine-tuning (Sec. 3.1) followed by reinforcement learning with visual feedback for structural refinement (Sec. 3.2).

#### 3.1 SFT Training Curriculum

SFT aims to enable the model to generate syntactically valid and structurally plausible SVG programs that capture common diagram patterns, including geometric primitives, text annotations, and hierarchical groupings. Specifically, we fine-tune a VLM with parameters θ to model the conditional distribution pθ(y | x) over SVG programs given an input image. The supervised fine-tuning objective maximizes the likelihood of training data:

LSFT = −E(x,y)∼D [log pθ(y | x)]. (1)

Notably, training directly on complex scientific figures from the outset often leads to unstable convergence and degenerate outputs, as the model must simultaneously learn low-level primitive generation and high-level compositional reasoning. To mitigate this, we adopt a two-stage curriculum strategy: the model is first trained on structurally simpler diagrams (SVG-Diagrams [21], Molmo2-Diagram [4], and VFig-Data-Shapes-and-Arrows) to establish robust primitive-level generation and basic layout understanding, and then fine-tuned on complex scientific figures (VFig-Data-Complex-Diagrams) to develop compositional reasoning and structural fidelity. This progressive training schedule allows the model to build a strong foundation in shape and text rendering before tackling the full complexity of real-world diagrams.

#### 3.2 Reinforcement Learning with Visual Feedback

While SFT enables the model to produce plausible SVG programs, it optimizes token-level likelihood rather than the visual quality of the rendered output—a mismatch that can leave perceptible layout and rendering errors

unaddressed. To close this gap, we introduce a reinforcement learning stage with visual feedback that directly optimizes for visual fidelity and structural correctness. Specifically, we adopt Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) [25], which estimates advantages from group-level comparisons without requiring a separate reward model, making it well suited for our setting where reward signals are derived from rendered image quality.

For each input figure x ∈ D, the model samples multiple SVG programs, each of which is rendered into yˆ and scored by a reward function R(x,yˆ) that measures visual similarity. Programs that fail to produce valid renderings (e.g., due to syntax errors or rendering timeouts) receive zero reward, naturally penalizing malformed outputs. The resulting scalar rewards are used to update the policy via GRPO with KL regularization against the SFT checkpoint to prevent reward hacking and maintain generation stability. Formally, GRPO maximizes the following objective:

θ(·|x) [R(x,yˆ) − β KL(πθ(·|x)∥πref(·|x))], (2) where πref is the frozen SFT policy and β controls the strength of KL.

LGRPO = Ex∼D,yˆ∼π

Reward Designs. To calculate the reward, the predicted SVG is first extracted from the <svg>...</svg> block and rendered into a raster image using CairoSVG 4 at the same resolution as the reference image. A VLM judge (Gemini-3-Flash) then compares the rendered prediction against the ground-truth image and outputs four rubric scores in [0,1]:

- – Presence (rpres). Measures whether all required visual elements (shapes, arrows, labels) are present. This term penalizes missing components and discourages incomplete diagram generation.
- – Layout (rlayout). Evaluates spatial arrangement, alignment, and relative positioning. Scientific diagrams require precise structural placement; this term ensures geometric correctness beyond mere element existence.
- – Connectivity (rconn). Checks whether arrows and lines connect the correct endpoints. This is critical for preserving relational semantics (e.g., source–destination correctness), which pixel similarity metrics often fail to capture.
- – Details (rdet). Assesses text accuracy and fine styling attributes such as font, stroke, and color. This term encourages preservation of fine-grained visual fidelity important for scientific readability.

The final reward is an unweighted average across the four individual rewards: R = 41 (rpres + rlayout + rconn + rdet). We adopt a rubric-based VLM judge to provide high-level rewards instead of using pixel-level distance metrics (e.g., L2, SSIM, LPIPS) because scientific diagrams require structural and semantic fidelity beyond perceptual similarity. For example, pixel-level visual similarity metrics may assign high scores to outputs with very different arrows due to their relatively small areas, whereas rubric-based evaluation captures semantic differences better and aligns with human judgment of diagram fidelity. Empirically, Gemini judge scores exhibit strong Pearson correlation with human judgments on 100 annotated examples (overall r = 0.89; presence r = 0.79; layout r = 0.63; connectivity r = 0.83; details r = 0.87), indicating good alignment with human perception of diagram structure and visual fidelity.

### 4 Experiments

We conduct a systematic empirical study to answer these four research questions: (1) How effectively can current VLMs convert complex figures into faithful, editable SVG code? (2) Does coarse-to-fine curriculum SFT improve compositional figure generation? (3) Can RL with visual feedback improve structural fidelity and fine-grained detail reproduction? (4) Which level of visual feedback—pixel-level reconstruction or higher-level structural judgment—yields the largest gains during RL optimization? In this section, we first detail our experimental setups and discuss our results to these questions.

#### 4.1 Training Setup

SFT. We experiment with recent vision-language models as our backbones, including Qwen3-VL-4B, Qwen3-VL8B [1], Qwen2.5-VL-3B [2], and InternVL3.5-4B [40]. To adapt these models efficiently, we employ LoRA-based parameter-efficient fine-tuning [10], update only the language model parameters while keeping the vision encoder

and multimodal projector frozen. This configuration provides a favorable trade-off between performance and computational efficiency. We use LoRA with rank 64 and train for 3 epochs with a maximum sequence length of 8192 tokens. All models are trained on 5×NVIDIA L40S GPUs. Additional implementation details and ablation settings are provided in the Appendix.

RL. We perform RL with GRPO [25] on the SFT checkpoints. For each prompt, we sample n = 8 candidate SVG responses and compute group-wise normalized advantages from their scalar rewards defined in Sec. 3.2. The policy is initialized from the SFT checkpoint. Similar to SFT, we apply LoRA (rank 64) to the language backbone to enable stable and efficient policy updates. Training follows an actor–rollout–reference configuration with a KL regularizer (coefficient 0.01) to constrain policy drift from the SFT initialization. We also include an entropy bonus (coefficient 0.001) to encourage exploration during optimization. RL training is conducted on 4×NVIDIA L40S GPUs.

#### 4.2 Evaluation Setup

Baselines. We compare our approach against a diverse set of baselines, including proprietary VLMs (Gemini 3 Flash, Gemini 3 Pro [7], and GPT-5.2 [17]) specialized SVG generation VLMs (OmniSVG [36], StarVector [21]) and classical raster-to-vector method VTracer [27].

Benchmark. We evaluate figure-to-SVG generation on three diagram-centric benchmarks. VFig-Bench contains 392 realistic scientific figures held out from VFig-Data-Complex-Diagrams. The Molmo2-Diagrams benchmark consists of 500 diagram samples held out from the Molmo2-Diagram [4]. SVG-Diagrams benchmark includes 474 diagram-oriented SVG examples from the official test split of the StarVector dataset [21]. Together, these benchmarks cover both simple diagrams and complex real-world paper figures.

Metrics. We evaluate figure-to-SVG generation by comparing the rasterized prediction with the ground-truth image. For pixel-level similarity, we report SSIM [29] and LPIPS [38]. We further report VisualSim, defined as the average of cosine similarities between DINO [18], CLIP [19], and SigLIP [37] embeddings of the reference image and rendered prediction, which captures image-level visual similarity. Beyond perceptual similarity, we employ rubric-based VLM judges to score diagram quality following the same rubric used in our RL reward (Sec. 3.2).

We report the overall average score across four dimensions: presence, layout, connectivity, and details. In addition to Gemini-3-Flash, which is also used to provide training rewards, we additionally apply GPT-5.2 as another VLM judge.

We also report svg cleanliness and render rate to measure the generated SVG code’s quality. svg cleanliness measures the proportion of semantic primitives and connectors (e.g., rect, circle, line) among all geometric

- Fig. 5: Qualitative comparison across models. Given the same input raster image, we compare the rendered SVG outputs produced by different methods. Our model more faithfully preserves the structure of the input diagram. P/L/C/D denote the Gemini judge scores for presence, layout, connectivity, and details.

elements, where higher values indicate more structured and editable SVG representations. Render rate is the percentage of generated SVG code that can be successfully rendered into images.

For the programmatically generated benchmark, where ground-truth structural metadata is available, we additionally report a rule-based evaluation score that directly compares predicted SVG elements with the reference specification. The metric evaluates correctness of shapes and arrows (e.g., geometry, connectivity, and style attributes) and aggregates them into a structural fidelity score; full details are provided in Appendix.

#### 4.3 Results

This section answers the research questions outlined in the introduction. The main takeaways are: (1) Current VLMs can render figures but still struggle to produce faithful, editable SVGs: classical raster-to-vector methods achieve high pixel similarity but fail to generate clean primitives, while open-source VLM baselines perform worse in both visual fidelity and structural correctness (Table 2). (2) Coarse-to-fine curriculum SFT improves compositional stability, with two-stage training producing more consistent structures and higher judge scores (Table 4). (3) RL with visual feedback further improves generation quality, consistently outperforming SFT alone across evaluation metrics (Table 2). (4) Structure-aware rewards are more effective than pixel-level objectives: structural rewards improve judge-based metrics, while pixel losses may increase SSIM but degrade structural quality (Table 5).

Table 2 reports performance across the three datasets. Our method achieves the best overall performance among open-source approaches. In particular, Ours (SFT+RL) obtains the best LPIPS, VisualSim, VLMJudge, Clean, and Render scores across all three benchmarks, indicating stronger visual fidelity, structural correctness, and SVG editability. On pixel-level metrics, it also achieves the best SSIM on VFig-Bench and Molmo2-Diagram, while Starvector-8B attains the highest SSIM on SVG-Diagrams. Compared with the supervised baseline Ours (SFT), reinforcement learning further improves performance consistently across all reported metrics on all three datasets. Figure 5 further illustrates qualitative differences between methods.

- Table 3: Backbone. Qwen3-VL consistently outperforms the other backbones by large margins on visual metrics, with the 8B model slightly better than 4B across all metrics.

Average across VFig-Bench + Molmo2-Diagram + SVG-Diagram Models SSIM↑ LPIPS↓ VisualSim↑ VLM-Judge↑ Clean↑ Render↑

Table 4: Curriculum. We note that the two-stage curriculum improves the render success rate by a lot over the one-stage one and slightly increases the VLM-judge score.

#### 4.4 Ablations

SFT Backbone. Table 3 reports results aggregated across the three diagram benchmarks. Overall, Qwen3-VL achieves the strongest performance, with the 8B variant obtaining the best or near-best results across most metrics. Compared with earlier backbones such as InternVL3.5 and Qwen2.5-VL, Qwen3-VL produces more faithful and structurally consistent SVG outputs. While the 8B model generally outperforms the 4B variant, the margin is moderate, making the 4B model a competitive choice when computational efficiency is important. Training curriculum. Table 4 also reports ablation regarding training strategy. We found that the two-stage curriculum consistently improves structural consistency and LLM-based evaluation scores. This suggests that learning primitive-level generation and simple layouts first helps stabilize training before adapting to more complex scientific figures.

RL Rewards. Table 5 reports ablation results for different RL reward designs. Our full reward combines four structural components: presence, layout, connectivity, and details. Removing any component degrades judgebased metrics, with the largest drops observed when removing layout or details, indicating the importance of spatial arrangement and fine-grained structural fidelity.

Adding pixel-level objectives (Full+Pixel) slightly improves pixel similarity but reduces judge-based scores, suggesting misalignment between pixel reconstruction and structural optimization. Restricting RL to a curated subset of difficult samples (Hard Data) also does not improve performance, indicating that diverse training data benefits RL stability.

### 5 Related Work

Tracing-based Vectorization. A line of classical works convert raster images into vector graphics by tracing curves to output compact vector files [6,14,32]. Early systems such as Potrace approximate bitmap contours with smooth Bézier curves and remain a strong baseline for monochrome tracing [24]. More recent tools like VTracer extend this paradigm with color handling and heuristic curve fitting [27]. While efficient and visually faithful, tracing-based methods optimize for contour accuracy rather than diagram structure: they typically produce many unconstrained Bézier paths instead of editable primitives (e.g., boxes, arrows, axes, text), and cannot enforce alignment or other domain constraints required for controllable scientific diagram generation.

Learning-based Vector Graphics Models. Learning-based (non-LLM) approaches model vector graphics directly or rely on differentiable rendering to bridge raster supervision and vector outputs [8,11,15,28]. SVGVAE [15] learns a latent-variable model for SVG generation with sequential decoding. DeepSVG [3] learns a hierarchical generative model over SVG command sequences, enabling structured synthesis and latent-space

editing. Differentiable rasterization frameworks such as DiffVG [13] allow gradients to flow from raster losses to vector parameters, and Im2Vec [20] demonstrates that vector graphics can be synthesized without vector supervision by optimizing primitives through differentiable rendering. Related work such as LIVE [16] improves raster-to-vector fitting via progressive, layer-wise construction. These methods improve flexibility and learnability compared to classical tracers, but often struggle with semantic primitive selection and maintaining global structure in complex SVGs.

LLM/VLM-based SVG Code Generation. LLM/VLM-based SVG Code Generation. Recent work reframes SVG generation as multimodal code synthesis using large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs). StarVector [21] introduces a multimodal LLM trained to generate SVG programs from figures and text, emphasizing semantic primitive usage over pure curve fitting. LLM4SVG [34] improves SVG generation by introducing semantic tokens and better modeling command ordering to reduce ambiguity and hallucination. OmniSVG [36] further proposes a unified multimodal framework that tokenizes SVG commands and coordinates, enabling scalable end-to-end SVG generation across tasks. Related directions include VLM-based prediction of human-readable SVG command sequences [39], diffusion/optimization-based text-to-SVG generation [12, 35], hybrid LLM–diffusion pipelines [30], and text-guided vector icon synthesis [31]. More recently, researchers have explored improving SVG generation through enhanced reasoning and learning signals: Reason-SVG [33] introduces a “Drawing-with-Thought” paradigm in which models generate SVG code together with explicit design rationales, while RLRF [23] improves generation via reinforcement learning from rendering feedback that compares rendered SVG outputs with the input image. These approaches enable instruction-conditioned and semantically structured SVG generation, but introduce new challenges in long-horizon consistency, syntactic validity, and evaluation.

Datasets & Evaluation. Existing datasets [5,21,34,36,41] for SVG generation and figure-to-SVG translation largely focus on icons, emojis, and artistic graphic designs, offering limited coverage of scientific figures and diagrams. Related figure datasets such as Paper2Fig [22] contains around 100K figures scraped from arXiv, including architecture and methodology diagrams with embedded text, boxes, and connecting arrows. However, these data are primarily curated to support text-aware figure reconstruction (i.e., image autoencoding with improved text fidelity), rather than figure-to-SVG translation. As a result, they require substantial filtering and restructuring for SVG-oriented tasks and do not provide paired SVG programs. To address these gaps, we introduce VFig-Data, a large-scale dataset for diverse scientific figure-to-SVG conversion, and VFig-Bench, a unified benchmark that consolidates datasets, tasks, and metrics tailored to scientific diagram understanding and SVG generation. Together, they provide a foundation for training and evaluating SVG models on scientific figures.

### 6 Conclusion

We proposed VFig, a family of vision–language models for complex figure-to-SVG conversion. To enable scalable learning and reliable evaluation, we introduced VFig-Data (66K curated figure–SVG pairs) and VFigBench with structure-aware metrics beyond pixel similarity. Our coarse-to-fine training recipe (SFT followed by rendering-aware RL) improves fidelity and structural correctness across benchmarks, outperforming strong baselines. We will publicly release the models, data, and evaluation tools to support future work on editable scientific figure generation.

### A VFig-Data

This section provides additional details on the construction of the VFig dataset, including: (i) figure collection from arXiv documents and programmatically generated diagrams; (ii) the image filtering pipeline applied to curate high-quality samples; (iii) the definition of the SVG Structural Complexity Metrics used to characterize structural properties of the dataset; and (iv) the rule-based evaluation for VFig-Data-Shapes-and-Arrows dataset.

#### A.1 Arxiv Data

To complement our synthetic and model-generated sources with realistic scientific figures, we curate an in-thewild corpus from two pipelines: (i) figures adapted from the Paper2Fig dataset [22], and (ii) a large-scale crawl of recent arXiv papers.

For the large-scale acquisition of recent research, we developed an automated pipeline to curate scientific figures from arXiv papers published after January 2025. By leveraging the arXiv API, we systematically queried and processed a total of 259,073 documents. To ensure the collected diagrams align with the target distribution of our benchmark, we restricted the crawl to specific computer science and systems-oriented disciplines.

For each selected paper, we extracted referenced figure assets from the LATEX source by identifying \includegraphics

occurrences. We prioritized high-quality formats (PDF, PNG, JPG/JPEG) and discarded unsupported or missing references. For figures provided as embedded PDFs, we rasterized them using PyMuPDF to ensure a unified image representation. Following the image-level filtering procedure described in Sec. 2.2, we retained 45k highquality figures.

#### A.2 VFig-Data-Complex-Diagrams Generation

To obtain the best model selection pipeline for SVG generation, we developed a web sandbox5 for qualitative comparison for all models from the Gemini, GPT, and Anthropic families. From this initial screening, we identified two competitive candidates for deeper evaluation: Gemini 3 Pro → Gemini 3 Pro, and Gemini 3 Pro → GPT-5.1. In both pipelines, the first stage generates a detailed textual description of the input image, and the second stage converts that description into SVG code. To compare these, we conducted an internal human evaluation survey across 332 tasks, collecting 1088 responses from 5 annotators. Annotators identified the superior pipeline for a given sample or chose "both good" or "both bad" and flagged issues across four categories: arrows not to scale, overlapping content, missing content, and rendering failures for the winning inference(s). As shown in Figure 6, the most common failure modes were overlapping content and arrows not to scale, while outright rendering failures were rare. Based on this evaluation, the Gemini 3 Pro → Gemini 3 Pro pipeline was preferred in 88.7% of decisive responses, compared to 11.3% for Gemini 3 Pro → GPT-5.1, and was adopted as our generation backbone. All evaluated examples and results are publicly accessible.6 Representative examples of cases where each pipeline produced superior outputs are shown below (Figure 7 and 8).

[Figure 104]

Fig. 6: Distribution of annotated issues across 332 evaluated samples.

The prompts used for each stage are as follows: Prompt: Description Stage

Please provide an extremely detailed description of this image. Describe every visual element, including shapes, colors, positions, sizes, text content, styles, patterns, gradients, shadows, borders, and any other visual characteristics. Be as thorough as possible, as this description will be used to recreate the image as an SVG.

#### Prompt: SVG Generation Stage

You are a technical SVG code generator. Your task is to convert the attached image into SVG markup that reconstructs all visual elements from the original image. Return only the SVG code, with no explanations, markdown, or additional text. The output should start with <svg> and end with </svg>. Use appropriate SVG elements such as path, rect, circle, and text, and specify a proper viewBox. Ensure that text does not overflow its container, lines do not overlap other elements, and the layout preserves sufficient spacing for readability. Preserve the original colors, structure, and text content, and ensure that arrows are drawn to scale with those in the input image.

#### A.3 VFig-Data-Shapes-and-Arrows Generation

Each sample is generated in four sequential steps: selecting a layout, placing shapes, assigning visual styles, and routing connections. The completed SVG is then rasterized into a PNG, and all 10 attributes per shape and 6 per arrow are recorded in a paired JSON metadata file for our rule-based evaluation.

Layout Selection. Shape positions are seeded by one of 19 layout templates designed to mimic human-made diagrams and avoid outputs with no structure. Each template encodes a unique set of shape positions along with connection hints specifying which shapes should be linked. Randomized jitter is applied to all shape positions to avoid rigid and similar layouts and additional arrows may be generated as discussed below. For additional variance, with probability 0.3, two templates are combined by splitting the canvas in half and applying one to each side, with a small number of cross-connections added between them

Shape Placement. The generator supports 18 shape types: 12 flat shapes (circle, rectangle, square, ellipse, diamond, hexagon, parallelogram, trapezoid, blob, wave-rect, cloud, text-label) and 6 pseudo-3D shapes (cylinder, prism, cube, 3d-diamond, 3d-hexagon, 3d-trapezoid). Each diagram draws from a palette of 2–3 randomly selected types, with a bias against placing the same type consecutively to mimic human-made diagrams. Shape sizes are randomized within a fixed range. Candidate positions are validated using Axis-Aligned Bounding Box (AABB) collision detection based on bounding box to prevent shape overlap, while enforcing a minimum centerto-center separation between shapes. If a position fails, alternatives are tried at increasing radii; shapes that

cannot be placed are skipped. With probability 0.15, a flat shape is rendered as a stack of 2–4 layered copies, each offset and progressively darkened to suggest depth.

Visual Style Assignment. Each shape is assigned one of 7 fill styles—solid, hatching, dots, crosshatch, horizontal-lines, linear gradient, or radial gradient—implemented as SVG pattern or gradient definitions, with parameters randomized per shape. Each diagram also samples a single border style (solid, dashed, dotted, or dash-dot), stroke width, and with probability 0.6, rounded corners with a randomized radius. Fill colors are drawn from a palette of light colors; strokes from dark colors. Arrow colors are selected per diagram (1–3 distinct colors). Labels come from a domain-specific word bank with word-level uniqueness enforced per diagram, rendered in 1–2 font families selected from a set of 8.

Connection Routing. Given n placed shapes, the number of directed edges c is drawn from a randomized range [nrℓ, nrh], where rℓ and rh are the lower and upper connection density ratios, each sampled per diagram:

c ∼ U(⌊nrℓ⌋, ⌊nrh⌋), rℓ ∼ U(0.4,0.6), rh ∼ U(0.6,0.8).

Template hints are consumed first; random pairs fill the remainder. Each ordered pair appears at most once; bidirectional pairs are offset sideways so both arrowheads remain visible. Each arrow independently samples a stroke width, arrowhead size, and line pattern (solid, dashed, or dotted), and is drawn as a straight line (60%) or quadratic Bezier curve (40%). Arrow endpoints attach at the exact shape boundary via ray-casting from the shape center: analytically for circles and ellipses, and via parametric ray segment intersection for polygons and

- 3D shapes. Curved arrows use a quadratic Bezier with a perpendicularly offset control point, we ensure paths don’t interesect an intermediate shape to avoid confusion when running inference.

#### A.4 Image Filtering

We provide additional details for the image filtering stage used to construct the VFig dataset. Specifically, we employ a classifier using Gemini-3-Flash to automatically filter figures extracted from scientific documents, retaining only structured diagram-style figures suitable for SVG generation. The filtering prompt is given below.

[Figure 108]

[Figure 109]

Fig. 8: Examples where the Gemini-3-Pro → GPT-5.1 pipeline produced superior SVG outputs.

#### Prompt: Figure Filtering Classifier

You are a highly precise automated figure-filtering classifier. Return exactly one word from: IMAGE, PLOT, MATH, KEEP. Do not output any additional text. Goal. Keep only figures that are structured SVG-style diagrams used for systems, pipelines, architectures, networks, or flowcharts. Filter out all other figure types (plots, tables, screenshots, photos, simulations, textures, memes, anatomy charts, etc.). Apply the following rules in order. The first matching rule determines the label.

- 1) PLOT Return PLOT if the figure primarily presents data or results, including:

- – line, bar, or scatter plots; histograms; box or violin plots
- – heatmaps, confusion matrices, correlation matrices
- – charts with axes, ticks, legends, or color bars
- – geographic or data maps
- – tables or spreadsheet-style layouts

- 2) IMAGE Return IMAGE if the figure is primarily illustrative or image-like content, including:

- – photographs or natural images
- – screenshots of software interfaces or terminals
- – simulation outputs or 3D-rendered scenes
- – qualitative grids of many image panels
- – textures, gradients, or raster patterns
- – memes, emojis, cartoons, or comics
- – infographic-style posters or anatomy diagrams

Small illustrative photo insets are allowed only if the overall figure remains a structured diagram.

- 3) MATH Return MATH if the figure is dominated by mathematical notation, including multiple equations, integrals, summations, matrices, or proof-like derivations. If the figure is a structured diagram containing only small mathematical annotations, return KEEP instead.
- 4) KEEP Return KEEP only if the figure is primarily a structured diagram typically drawn using SVG primitives in research papers, including:

- – flowcharts, pipelines, block diagrams, architecture diagrams
- – diagrams composed mainly of text, boxes, arrows, and icons
- – coordinate schematics with axes or reference grids
- – diagrams containing small mathematical annotations
- – diagrams with a few small illustrative photo insets

#### A.5 SVG Structural Complexity Metrics

To quantitatively characterize the structural properties of SVG datasets, we define a set of interpretable metrics that measure geometric complexity and semantic organization. These metrics are designed to correlate with sequence modeling difficulty while remaining simple and reproducible.

Given an SVG file, elements are counted in a case-insensitive manner and grouped into four categories: (i) basic primitives (rect, circle, ellipse), (ii) connectors (line, polyline), (iii) complex shapes (path, polygon), and (iv) text (text).

We denote

- B = #(basic primitives), (3) K = #(connectors), (4)
- C = #(complex shapes), (5) T = #(text elements), (6) N = B + K + C, (7)

where N counts geometric elements only (excluding text). A small constant ϵ (e.g., 10−9) is used to avoid division by zero when necessary. Element Complexity (EC). Element Complexity measures the overall geometric and labeling burden of a figure:

EC = log (1 + N + T). (8)

Higher EC indicates denser figures with more drawable objects and annotations. The logarithmic scaling stabilizes the metric for large figures and reduces sensitivity to extreme outliers. Semantic Cleanliness (Clean). Semantic Cleanliness measures the proportion of semantic primitives and connectors relative to path-based tracing:

B + K N

C N

. (9)

= 1 −

Clean =

Values close to 1 indicate structured, editable SVGs composed primarily of semantic primitives and connectors, while lower values indicate path-dominated representations typical of tracing-based SVGs. Path Dominance (PD). For completeness, we also report Path Dominance:

C N

= 1 − Clean. (10) PD captures the extent to which an SVG relies on complex tracing-style elements.

PD =

Tracing-based SVGs typically exhibit higher element complexity and higher path dominance, which increases sequence length and reduces structural interpretability. In contrast, semantically structured SVG representations emphasize primitives and connectors, yielding higher cleanliness and improved controllability for sequence modeling and editing tasks.

#### A.6 Rule-Based Benchmark for VFig-Data-Shapes-and-Arrows.

Since our VFig-Data-Shapes-and-Arrows dataset includes structured metadata describing element attributes and relationships (Section 2.1), we evaluate generated SVGs directly against this ground-truth specification. For each sample we compute R = (RS + RA)/2, where

RS: Shapes are matched to ground-truth metadata by label, then scored across nine visual attributes: shape type, fill and stroke color, fill and border style, font, aspect ratio, and relative spatial position.

[Figure 110]

[Figure 111]

[Figure 112]

[Figure 113]

Fig. 9: Examples illustrating the structural complexity metrics. For each SVG diagram we report element counts (B, K, C, T) and the derived metrics EC, Clean, and PD. Structured diagrams typically exhibit higher cleanliness and lower path dominance.

- Table 6: Rule-based evaluation on VFig-Data-Shapes-and-Arrows (500 samples). All scores in [0, 1]; higher is better. RS and RA are shape and arrow composites after extra-element penalty; R is their mean.

‡OmniSVG is evaluated on the original transparent-background SVG inputs as in the main paper. Here the inputs use white backgrounds, causing many outputs to be rejected as empty_image, so no file is saved. § 497 of 500 StarVector outputs cannot be parsed as valid SVG; the model is therefore excluded from the main comparison.

RA: Arrows are matched by endpoint proximity to their expected source and destination shapes, then scored across seven attributes: connectivity, arrowhead presence and size, curvature, and color.

Each metric produces a score in [0,1], where higher is better. All color comparisons use the ℓ2 distance in RGB space normalized by the diameter of the RGB cube, mapping any color pair to [0,1]. We provide detailed definitions for each metric below.

Shape attributes: Label (Lbl). Measures text-label correctness. A score of 1.0 is assigned for an exact match, with partial credit

proportional to word overlap and 0.0 for no overlap.

Type (Typ). Evaluates whether the generated SVG element type (e.g., rect, ellipse, path, g) matches the expected type. Accepted tags receive 1.0, plausible substitutes receive 0.3–0.4, and incorrect elements receive 0.0.

Fill color (FC). Measures fill color accuracy using normalized RGB distance. Ground-truth colors are read from the JSON metadata rather than the SVG directly to avoid ambiguities from blended or patterned fills.

Fill style (FS). Evaluates the fill pattern (solid, dots, crosshatch, hatching, or gradient). The generated pattern is inferred from the SVG <defs> section. Exact matches score 1.0; mismatched patterned styles score 0.5; solid vs. patterned mismatches score 0.0.

Stroke color (SC). Border color accuracy measured using the same normalized RGB distance as fill color. Border style (BS). Evaluates the stroke dash pattern (solid, dashed, dotted, or dash-dot) using the stroke-dasharray

attribute. Exact matches score 1.0; different non-solid patterns score 0.5; solid vs. non-solid mismatches score

- 0.0. Position (Pos). Measures spatial layout using anchor-relative offsets, making the score invariant to global

translation and scale differences between the generated and ground-truth canvases.

Font (Fnt). Checks the font family, mapped to a class (serif, sans-serif, monospace). Exact name matches score 1.0, same-class matches score 0.5, and mismatches score 0.0.

Aspect ratio (AR). Measures width-to-height ratio accuracy. Ratios within 20% of the ground truth score

- 1.0, with the score decaying linearly to 0.0 at a 3× deviation. Arrow attributes: Source / destination (Src, Dst). Evaluates whether arrow endpoints connect to the correct shapes. Endpoints

are matched to the nearest shape bounding box within 100px, and the matched label is compared to the groundtruth connection. The reversed orientation is also considered and the better match kept. Binary scoring: 1.0 for correct, 0.0 otherwise.

Head (Hd). Checks for the presence of an arrowhead using the marker-end attribute or a polygon sibling in the same group. If the ground-truth arrowhead is visually occluded by another shape, missing arrowheads are not penalized.

Head size (Sz). Evaluates arrowhead size relative to stroke width. Both dimensions are normalized by stroke width before comparison. Scores are assigned in four tiers, ranging from 1.0 (within 30%) to 0.1 (more than

- 2.5× deviation). Curve (Cv). Determines whether arrow curvature matches the ground truth (straight or curved) by detecting

Bézier or arc commands in the SVG path. Binary scoring: 1.0 for a match, 0.0 otherwise.

Color (Col). Measures arrow stroke color accuracy using normalized RGB distance, with CSS inheritance resolved from ancestor elements and style definitions.

Overlap (Ovl). Penalizes arrows whose endpoints fall inside shapes they are not supposed to connect to. Scores are 1.0 for no violations, 0.4 for one incorrect endpoint, and 0.0 for two or more violations.

#### A.7 Standalone Rule-Based Evaluation and Benchmarks

The evaluation in Table 6 relies on structured JSON metadata bundled with VFig-Data-Shapes-and-Arrows, which provides ground-truth labels, colors, and layout information directly. For real-world SVGs where no such metadata exists, we instead extract equivalent ground-truth attributes directly from the ground truth SVG file. This standalone approach is necessarily noisier, however validation on VFig-Data-Shapes-and-Arrows shows negligible differences from the JSON-based evaluation across all models and metrics, with mean absolute gaps of at most 0.003 on RS, 0.001 on RA, and 0.002 on R overall, confirming that standalone attribute extraction is a reliable proxy for the JSON ground truth.

We then use this standalone rule-based evaluation to benchmark models on external datasets: arXiv figures (arXiv) and diagrams generated by Molmo (Molmo). The actual metrics and their weighting is unchanged, however we are using new methods for deriving the values from the ground truth SVG instead of using the JSON metadata generated with the dataset. Table 7 reports composite scores for all models evaluated on these benchmarks.

It is worth noting that this rule-based approach depends on accurately extracting visual attributes from generated SVG markup, which can both under- and over-estimate true visual quality. Models using unconventional but valid element structures may be penalized unfairly, while models producing invisible or malformed elements may receive undeserved credit. Scores are therefore best interpreted as an approximation of fidelity rather than an exact measure. By using supersets of valid SVG generations across all models, a variety of evaluation datasets, and fine-tuning detection attribute extraction algorithms to input formats, we mitigate these drawbacks.

Across all three external benchmarks, RL is the strongest open-source model, leading on R, RS, and RA on all evaluation datasets, and coming close to the closed-source models on Molmo. Gemini-3-Pro and GPT-5.2 perform on par overall. OmniSVG scores zero on all shape metrics due to output being rendered with raw paths instead of shape SVG elements. Qwen3-VL has high parse failure rates and poor fill and stroke scores across benchmarks but achieves reasonable arrow scores.

In per-metric tables we see shape fidelity (RS) is the harder sub-task for all models. Font is a consistent weak point, with scores rarely exceeding 0.27, as models default to generic system fonts regardless of the ground-truth family. Fill style is similarly low for fine-tuned models, suggesting that training on structural accuracy comes at the cost of visual fidelity.

Arrow scores (RA) are generally strong, particularly on Molmo where the top models exceed 0.80. Source and destination matching is reliable across models, indicating that connectivity is well learned. Head size is a consistent weak point, with models frequently over- or under-scaling arrowheads relative to stroke width.

More detailed per-metric breakdowns of model performance on each dataset using this standalone evaluation are given in Tables 8, 9, and 10.

#### B.1 Training Setup

We describe the training configurations for both supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). SFT Training Configuration. Table 11 summarizes the main hyperparameters used in SFT. We adopt Qwen3VL-4B-Instruct as the backbone and perform parameter-efficient fine-tuning using LoRA with rank 64 applied to language model layers only, while keeping the vision encoder and projector frozen. The maximum sequence length is set to 8192 tokens, and input images are resized to at most 262,144 pixels (512 × 512). Training is conducted with a learning rate of 2 × 10−5 using the cosine scheduler with a warmup ratio of 0.1. We use a per-device batch size of 1 with gradient accumulation of 16 and train for 3 epochs using bf16 precision.

Across different backbones, the wall-clock training time varies depending on model size and training strategy. For the single-stage SFT setup, training takes approximately 3d20h for Qwen3-VL-8B, 1d03h for Qwen2.5-VL-

- 3B, and 1d14h for InternVL3.5-4B, while the Qwen3-VL-4B run was trained for approximately 5 days. For the two-stage training strategy, stage 1 and stage 2 are trained sequentially. Specifically, Qwen3-VL-8B requires 2d9h for stage 1 and 2d10h for stage 2, Qwen2.5-VL-3B requires 23h and 24h respectively, and InternVL3.5-4B requires

- 1d07h and 22h. The Qwen3-VL-4B stage 1 run was trained for approximately 5 days, and stage 2 requires about
- 2d20h. All experiments are conducted on 5×L40S GPUs unless otherwise specified; the Qwen3-VL-4B stage 2 run uses 8×L40S GPUs. RL Training Configuration. We initialize RL training from the two-stage SFT checkpoint of Qwen3-VL-

- 4B-Instruct and optimize the policy using GRPO. Due to compute and time constraints, we conduct RL only on the Qwen3-VL-4B backbone. Similar to SFT, we apply LoRA with rank 64 to the language model layers while keeping the vision tower frozen. Table 12 summarizes the main hyperparameters used in RL training. We train on the combined RL dataset with a train batch size of 64 and validation batch size of 64, using up to 50 validation samples for periodic evaluation. The maximum prompt length and response length are set to 9000 and 8500 tokens, respectively, and the rollout engine uses a maximum model length of 17,500 tokens. We optimize the policy with a learning rate of 9 × 10−6, cosine learning-rate decay, and a warmup ratio of 0.03 in bf16 precision. For policy optimization, we use a mini-batch size of 16 and a micro-batch size of 1 per GPU.

During rollout, we sample n = 8 candidate responses for each prompt to compute group-relative advantages. We further apply a KL regularization term with coefficient 0.01 and an entropy bonus with coefficient 0.001 to stabilize optimization and encourage exploration. RL training is performed on 4×L40S GPUs for approximately 30 hours. The reward is computed using our custom rubric-based reward function described in the main text.

#### B.2 Inference Setup

During inference, we generate SVG code with a maximum generation length of 8192 tokens. Given an input figure, the model receives the prompt “Convert this figure into valid SVG code.” together with the image, and produces the SVG program autoregressively. For our model and baselines without prescribed decoding settings, we use deterministic greedy decoding (do_sample=False). For OmniSVG-4B and Starvector-8B, we follow the default decoding parameters recommended in their official implementations. We use greedy decoding by default because SVG generation is a structured program synthesis task where small token-level errors can easily break the XML syntax or produce invalid code. Selecting the most probable token at each step generally improves structural stability compared to stochastic sampling. To ensure valid outputs, we further extract the content between the <svg> and </svg> tags from the generated text.

### C Additional Ablations

This section presents additional ablation studies for both SFT and RL training. Specifically, we analyze: (i) SFT design choices, including backbone selection, training curricula, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning configurations; and (ii) RL design choices, including reward decomposition and SFT initialization.

#### C.1 SFT Ablation

Tables 13 and 14 analyze the effect of backbone choice, training curriculum, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning configurations.

Table 11: SFT training configuration

- Table 13 provides the full per-dataset results for different SFT backbones and training curricula. While the

main paper reports aggregated results, this table reveals several dataset-specific behaviors. From Table 13, we observe a consistent trend that newer Qwen3-VL backbones outperform earlier VLMs across all datasets. In particular, Qwen3-VL achieves the strongest results on semantic metrics such as VisualSim and VLM-Judge, indicating improved alignment between generated SVG programs and diagram semantics. Increasing the model size from 4B to 8B provides additional gains, although the improvement is moderate across most metrics. Two-stage training further improves structural reliability and semantic alignment on the more compositionally complex datasets, suggesting that separating primitive-heavy diagram pretraining from realistic figure finetuning helps the model better capture hierarchical diagram structure. Based on these observations, we adopt Qwen3-VL-4B with two-stage SFT as the default backbone for subsequent RL experiments.

- Table 14 examines parameter-efficient fine-tuning configurations on Qwen2.5-VL-3B. Increasing the LoRA

rank generally improves semantic alignment metrics, with rank 64 achieving the best overall performance on VFig-Bench and Molmo2-Diagram, particularly in VisualSim and VLM-judge. However, lower ranks remain competitive on certain datasets, indicating that moderate ranks already capture much of the task adaptation.

We further compare different SFT target modules while fixing the LoRA rank to 64. Adapting the language model alone consistently yields the strongest or most balanced results across datasets, outperforming or matching configurations that additionally tune the projector or vision encoder. These results suggest that most taskspecific adaptation occurs in the language generation component responsible for producing structured SVG programs, while modifying the vision backbone or multimodal projector provides limited additional benefit in this setting.

#### C.2 RL Ablation

Tables 15 and 16 provide additional ablations for RL, covering both reward design and SFT initialization. Table 15 reports the full per-dataset breakdown of the reward ablation results. Consistent with the main paper, the full reward achieves the strongest judge-based performance across datasets, confirming the benefit of jointly optimizing presence, layout, connectivity, and details. The per-dataset view further shows that the relative importance of reward components varies across benchmarks. On VFig-Bench and SVG-Diagram, removing layout or details leads to clearer drops in VLM-Judge, supporting the intuition that these datasets require stronger spatial reasoning and fine-grained structural fidelity. Removing connectivity also hurts performance, although the degradation is generally smaller than removing layout or details. On Molmo2-Diagram, the differences across reward variants are more moderate, suggesting that this benchmark is comparatively more regular and less sensitive to reward decomposition. We also observe the same trade-off as in the main paper: adding pixel-level objectives improves SSIM/LPIPS on some datasets, but does not translate into better judge-based scores, indicating that pixel reconstruction is not always aligned with structural correctness.

Table 16 further analyzes two factors under the same RL framework: the choice of SFT initialization and the backbone model size. In the initialization ablation, we compare RL starting from one-stage and two-stage SFT checkpoints of Qwen3-VL-4B. Overall, both initializations benefit from RL, while the two-stage SFT initialization yields stronger semantic and structural performance on VFig-Bench and SVG-Diagram, achieving higher SSIM, VisualSim, and VLM-Judge, together with lower LPIPS. This suggests that the hierarchical training curriculum provides a better starting point for subsequent reward optimization, especially on benchmarks with more complex layout and element relationships. On Molmo2-Diagram, the pattern is more mixed: the two-stage initialization still achieves slightly stronger VisualSim and VLM-Judge, whereas the one-stage initialization attains better SSIM, LPIPS, Clean, and Render. This indicates that RL initialized from the one-stage checkpoint can still produce competitive visual fidelity and code quality on Molmo2-Diagram, but the two-stage initialization remains preferable when prioritizing semantic alignment and judge-based structural quality.

The model size ablation compares Qwen3-VL-4B and Qwen3-VL-8B under the same two-stage SFT initialization. Increasing the backbone size to 8B consistently improves VisualSim and VLM-Judge across all three datasets, and also gives the best SSIM and LPIPS on Molmo2-Diagram and SVG-Diagram. These gains suggest that a larger backbone improves semantic fidelity and structural alignment under RL. At the same time, the 4B model remains competitive on several code-level metrics: it attains higher Clean scores on all three datasets, matches the 8B model in Render on VFig-Bench, and achieves a slightly higher Render score on SVG-Diagram. On VFig-Bench, the 4B model also retains slightly better SSIM and LPIPS. Taken together, these results indicate a trade-off between perceptual or semantic quality and code cleanliness: the 8B model is generally stronger when optimizing for visual and judge-based quality, while the 4B model remains a more efficient choice and can produce cleaner SVG code. This supports our use of Qwen3-VL-4B with two-stage SFT as the default RL setting in the main paper, as it provides a favorable balance between structural fidelity, code quality, and computational efficiency.

### D Human Evaluation

To complement the VFig-Bench results in Sec. 4, we additionally conduct a human evaluation of figure-toSVG generation quality. While the main paper reports automatic metrics, including rubric-based VLM judging, direct human comparison offers a valuable perspective on how generation quality is perceived by human evaluators.

Evaluation setup. We compare four models: Gemini 3 Pro, GPT-5.2, VFig, and Qwen3-VL-4B. We run inference on a held-out set of scientific figure images scraped from arXiv using the same scraping and filtering pipeline described in the main paper. These images are not included in the VFig-Data training set.

We evaluate model outputs via pairwise human comparison. For each trial, an annotator is presented with a ground-truth figure alongside two SVG reconstructions produced by two randomly sampled models. The annotator is asked to judge which reconstruction more faithfully reproduces the original figure. Figure 12 illustrates the evaluation interface used in each trial. The available choices are:

- – A is better
- – B is better
- – Both are good (both reconstructions are acceptable)
- – Both are bad (neither reconstruction is acceptable)

This protocol captures not only relative preference between the two outputs, but also cases where both outputs are acceptable or both fail to faithfully reproduce the target figure. Comparisons were conducted by the authors, and model identities were hidden from annotators during evaluation.

Metrics. From the annotation results, we report three complementary summaries: (1) bootstrap-averaged Elo ratings, where both good and both bad outcomes are treated as ties; (2) a quality-aware summary reporting win rate, loss rate, both-good rate, both-bad rate, good rate (Win + Both Good), and decisive win rate (Win / (Win + Loss)); and (3) a pairwise comparison table reporting head-to-head outcomes for each model pair. Together, these metrics provide both a global ranking and a fine-grained view of human-perceived figure fidelity.

Results. Results are shown in Tables 17, 18, and 19. Gemini 3 Pro achieves the strongest overall human preference, followed by GPT 5.2, with VFig ranking third and clearly ahead of Qwen3-VL-4B. This ordering is consistent across all three summaries.

In the Elo ranking (Table 17), VFig scores 1473.8, surpassing Qwen3-VL-4B by a substantial margin, though it remains below GPT 5.2 and Gemini 3 Pro. In the quality-aware summary (Table 18), VFig achieves a 34.5% win rate and 44.4% good rate, compared to only 1.2% and 1.3% for Qwen3-VL-4B respectively.

Pairwise comparisons (Table 19) confirm the same pattern. Against Qwen3-VL-4B, VFig wins 81.6% of trials versus 2.0%, indicating a clear human preference for VFig’s reconstructions. Against GPT 5.2, VFig wins 17.4% of trials versus 53.2%, though a 16.9% both-good rate suggests that VFig produces competitive reconstructions on a non-trivial subset of examples.

These trends are consistent with the benchmark results reported in the main paper on VFig-Bench. Overall, the human evaluation confirms that VFig closes a substantial portion of the quality gap over smaller opensource baselines, while leaving room for improvement compared with the strongest proprietary systems. Figure 11 visualizes decisive pairwise win fractions with ties excluded.

### E Additional Qualitative Results

We provide additional qualitative results on all three evaluation sources in VFig-Bench, Molmo2-Diagram, and SVG-Diagram. Figures 13, 14, and 15 show representative examples generated by VFig on the three benchmarks, respectively. All examples are drawn from the test sets.

Overall, these examples highlight both the strengths and limitations of our model. On the positive side, VFig preserves the global diagram structure and layout well, so the rendered outputs often appear visually similar to the input figures. In particular, the model is generally effective at maintaining the high-level organization of objects and their spatial relationships.

On the VFig-Bench examples (Figure 13), our model significantly improves rendering success compared with the base Qwen3-VL-4B-Instruct. The base model frequently produces invalid or non-renderable SVG outputs, whereas VFig produces valid SVG programs for most inputs and generates diagrams that more closely resemble the original figures. In contrast, models such as StarVector-8B and OmniSVG struggle to handle these complex

scientific diagrams, often producing repetition in SVG elements, noisy primitives, or outright rendering failures. VFig therefore substantially improves robustness for complex figure reconstruction. At the same time, strong closed-source models such as Gemini3-Flash achieve very high visual fidelity on this benchmark, suggesting that further improvements are still possible.

On Molmo2-Diagram (Figure 14) and SVG-Diagram (Figure 15), we observe a similar overall trend: compared with open-source baselines, VFig more consistently produces valid SVG outputs and better preserves the global structure, layout, and major element relationships of the input images. These results are notable because both benchmarks differ from the complex scientific figures in VFig-Bench. In particular, Molmo2-Diagram contains many stylized and more cartoon-like diagrams, while SVG-Diagram includes sparse geometric graphics and, in some cases, images that are not canonical diagrams. Despite this distribution shift, VFig still reconstructs visually faithful outputs in many cases and remains robust across a broad range of diagram styles.

At the same time, the qualitative examples also highlight benchmark-specific behavior.On Molmo2-Diagram, VFig generally preserves high-level layout, grouping, and major visual structure well across a diverse range of examples, including line plots, simple object illustrations, and table-like summary graphics. On SVG-Diagram, it is often effective at maintaining relative positions, edge directions, and simple topology, and it can also handle some non-diagram graphics reasonably well. Strong closed-source models such as Gemini3-Flash still recover finer text, styling, and local details more accurately. We also note that StarVector-8B performs worse in our qualitative comparison than what may be expected from its original paper. In our evaluation, we follow the default decoding parameters provided in the official StarVector repository, which differ from the inference configuration described in the paper. This difference in decoding setup, along with possible differences in prompting, may partially explain the discrepancy relative to the results reported in the original work.

### F Failure Cases and Limitations

Across the three benchmarks, several common failure patterns can be observed. Errors are often observed in thin lines, arrows, small text-like elements, and other precise local structures. The model may also fail to reproduce exact colors or subtle stylistic details. Figures 16, 17, and 18 present representative failure cases across the three benchmarks.

Failure cases. On the VFig-Bench examples (Figure 16), failures are primarily associated with fine-grained geometric details. In particular, the Gemini detail metric is consistently the lowest among the four evaluation dimensions, indicating that local visual fidelity remains the main limitation of the model. Common errors include inaccurate arrowheads, distorted thin connectors, and incorrect rendering of small geometric components. Diagrams containing 3D shapes or perspective-like objects are especially challenging, often resulting in incorrect

geometry or missing structural elements. These results suggest that while the model captures global layout and object relationships well, it still struggles to reproduce precise local visual structures.

On the Molmo2-Diagram and SVG-Diagram examples (Figure 17 and Figure 18), we observe both shared and benchmark-specific failure patterns. Similar to VFig-Bench, many errors remain concentrated in fine-grained local details, such as thin lines, arrowheads, small annotations, and other precise visual structures. Even when the overall layout and major object relationships are largely preserved, these local inaccuracies can noticeably reduce visual fidelity.

These two benchmarks also expose a broader range of challenging inputs beyond canonical diagrams. In Molmo2-Diagram, failure cases often appear on more stylized examples and visually simplified graphics. In SVG-Diagram, the model can struggle on sparse geometric graphics as well as inputs that resemble logos, icons, simple object drawings, or chart-like visuals. In such cases, VFig may preserve only the coarse structure while simplifying shapes, missing small components, or distorting local geometry and styling. Overall, these examples suggest that the model’s generalization across diverse graphic styles and element types remains limited, especially when the inputs deviate from the structured diagram distributions emphasized during training.

Possible causes of failure. Several factors may contribute to the failure cases discussed above. First, our final reward design is based on the empirical observation in the main paper that the fully VLM-based reward performs better than the variants we tested with additional pixel-level objectives. However, this does not imply that pixel-level supervision is inherently unhelpful. In our current experiments, we only explored a limited set of pixel-level reward variants, namely equal-weight combinations of Gemini-based reward with L2, Canny-based L2, and SSIM-style image similarity terms. It remains possible that different types of pixel-level rewards, or different weighting ratios between structural and pixel-level objectives, could better improve fine-grained visual fidelity without sacrificing judge-based quality.

Second, our reward relies heavily on Gemini as a visual judge. Although Gemini-based judgment correlates well with human evaluation in our experiments, it is still an imperfect supervisory signal. Its preferences may not always align with human perception on every example, especially for subtle stylistic details, local geometry, or borderline rendering cases. Moreover, our current formulation assigns equal weights to the four rubric components—presence, layout, connectivity, and details. This equal-weight design is simple and effective in practice, but it is not necessarily the best approximation to human perceptual preferences: human judgments of figure quality may not correspond to a uniform average over these four aspects. Likewise, the specific judge prompt and rubric design may influence which errors are emphasized during training, and there may be additional dimensions of quality not fully captured by the current decomposition. Exploring alternative component weights, revised judge prompts, or richer reward dimensions could therefore further improve alignment between reward optimization and human judgments.

Third, our training data is primarily designed for complex diagram reconstruction rather than broad vector graphic generation. As a result, the data contains limited coverage of examples such as icons, sketches, simple object drawings, logos, and other non-canonical graphics. This mismatch is consistent with the qualitative failures observed on Molmo2-Diagram and SVG-Diagram, where some difficult examples fall outside the core distribution emphasized during training. Together, these observations suggest that further improvements may require both richer reward design and broader training data coverage beyond structured scientific diagrams.

###### Fig. 11: Pairwise win fractions in human evaluation with ties excluded. Each cell (A, B) reports the fraction of decisive comparisons in which model A is preferred over model B, excluding “both good” and “both bad” cases. Warmer colors indicate stronger pairwise preference. The visualization highlights that VFig consistently outperforms Qwen3-VL-4B and remains competitive with stronger proprietary baselines, while Gemini 3 Pro achieves the strongest overall pairwise preference.
