### Abstract

The evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly relies on other LLMs acting as judges. However, current evaluation paradigms typically yield a single score or ranking, answering which model is better but not why. While essential for benchmarking, these top-level scores obscure the specific, actionable reasons behind a model’s performance. To bridge this gap, we introduce CLEAR, an interactive, open-source package for LLM-based error analysis. CLEAR first generates per-instance textual feedback, then it creates a set of systemlevel error issues, and quantifies the prevalence of each identified issue. Our package also provides users with an interactive dashboard that allows for a comprehensive error analysis through aggregate visualizations, applies interactive filters to isolate specific issues or score ranges, and drills down to the individual instances that exemplify a particular behavioral pattern. We demonstrate CLEAR analysis for RAG and Math benchmarks, and showcase its utility through a user case study.

### 1 Introduction

The evaluation of generative AI systems is rapidly adopting the LLM-as-a-Judge (LLMaJ) paradigm (Zheng et al., 2023), where automatic evaluations by LLMs complement or even replace human annotators. LLM-based judges are commonly applied to rate or score the quality of LLM responses (Liu et al., 2023), or to choose a preferred response out of multiple candidates.

Aggregating these judgments over many examples provides AI developers with a robust assessment of their system, as well as systematic comparison and ranking of different systems or models (Gera et al., 2025). However, these scores or ratings

alone provide little insight into the model’s behavior. AI developers still rely on tedious, manual error analysis to identify recurring issues, understand the current limitations of their system and effectively plan and prioritize the next iteration of improvements.

In this work, we introduce CLEAR, a novel interactive tool for AI developers, designed to reduce the overhead of manual error analysis. Our approach utilizes an LLMaJ for generating textual feedback, and conducts discovery of recurring issues via Key Points Analysis (KPA) (Bar-Haim et al., 2020a). This method allows us to provide structured, textual feedback that characterizes and quantifies a model’s recurring weaknesses and issues across a whole dataset. These insights may guide further improvements, such as prompt engineering, model fine-tuning, or choosing a different LLM.

The CLEAR pipeline is illustrated in Figure 1. It starts with per-instance judgments, which include both a numeric score and textual feedback. It then employs a KPA module to categorize these individual critiques into a concise set of automaticallydiscovered issues. Each identified issue is mapped back to its matching judgments, which provides quantification for its prevalence, and allows the user to drill down from an issue to its specific examples. Lastly, we provide a user interface that allows for easy and dynamic exploration of issues within the data.

To demonstrate our system’s capabilities, we ran our system on several RAG (contextual questionanswering) and math benchmarks. We analyzed responses from several systems using different LLM Judges and KPA implementations. To further demonstrate our system usability for real-world AI developers, we also conducted a user study. Its results confirm the usefulness of CLEAR, and its potential value for reducing the time and effort required for error analysis.

- Figure 1: The CLEAR Framework. (a) Pipeline- Given a dataset (D) and a target system (s), the system generates

responses (R). A judge (J) provides per-instance textual feedback and a score ({ji}Ni=1). A Key Point Analysis module (K) extracts recurring issues and maps them to the individual ji’s. The discovered issues can be explored via the UI (b).

Our work makes the following contributions:

efficiency, and because the focus is on identifying shortcomings, only feedback associated with sn < 1 is considered during issue generation. Each tn is then linked to one or more relevant issues from this set. We explore two distinct implementations for this aggregation module, denoted K:

- 1. We propose a novel setup for generating automated system-level issues by summarizing and structuring instance-level feedback.
- 2. We present CLEAR, an open-source demo tool that implements our proposed approach, and an interactive UI, which together provide an accessible way for researchers and developers to gain deeper insights into their models’ behaviors.
- 3. We demonstrate the system on multiple domains, and conduct a user study to confirm its effectiveness.

Key Point Analysis (KPA): We adopt a classical KPA pipeline (Bar-Haim et al., 2020a,b), which is well-suited for texts containing short sentences, such as arguments or product reviews. To improve compatibility, we first break down each tn into a brief and well-formed sentence using an LLM. We then apply the KPA method to cluster the sentences and construct a set of issues over them. This clustering allows for mapping each judgment to the issues its sentences express.

### 2 Method

LLM-Based KPA: As an alternative approach, we propose LLM-Based KPA. We start by summarizing each critique tn into a shorter, normalized form via an LLM call. We then prompt an LLM with a batch of these summaries to identify highlevel recurring issues, and again to remove duplication and consolidate the final lists of issues. Finally, each tn is mapped to the derived issue set via a matching prompt. This process requires ∼ 2N LLM calls. Implementation details are provided in Appendix E.

CLEAR is designed to produce system-level feedback by analyzing a model’s behavior across a dataset. The full setup, illustrated in Figure 1, takes as input a dataset of instructions and a target system, and outputs a concise, structured, and quantified summary of the system’s recurring issues.

Formally, we assume a dataset D = {xn}Nn=1 consisting of N instructions, and a target system s. The system generates a corresponding set of responses R = {rn}Nn=1, where each rn = s(xn). Our framework then proceeds in two primary stages:

### 3 CLEAR Framework

An LLM-based judge J is prompted to evaluate each pair (xn,rn). For each instance, J returns a tuple jn = (tn,sn), where tn is a natural language critique and sn is a numeric quality score. These instance-level judgments capture localized failures or strengths observed by the judge. We note that our setup is reference-less, yet when a reference is available, it can be used as context for the judge.

#### 3.1 Pipeline

To support easy integration and usability, we provide CLEAR as a Python package available on PyPI. The package implements an end-to-end workflow: it generates model responses, evaluates them using an LLM judge, and performs key point analysis to identify recurring issues. Each component in the pipeline can be used independently or in combination, allowing users to customize the workflow to their specific needs or preferences.

The second stage clusters recurring patterns across the textual feedbacks {tn}Nn=1 into a set of concise, interpretable issues {im}Mm=1. For

(e/f) Model Behavior and Instance-Level View offer detailed, example-level insights to facilitate fine-grained error analysis and model diagnosis.

Moreover, the CLEAR pipeline is designed to be highly configurable. It supports multiple inference API providers for generating predictions or, alternatively, allows running the evaluation step independently if predictions are already available. In cases where judgments have been obtained separately, the pipeline can directly execute the final evaluation step (K step).

Evaluation Modes. To accommodate different preferences for issue discovery, CLEAR supports three evaluation modes: (1) General: issues are discovered dynamically using a general-purpose evaluation prompt, enabling broad, exploratory assessment without requiring data-specific prior knowledge; (2) Task-specific: users provide specific issues as evaluation criteria, guiding the judge while allowing for additional discoveries, and (3)

Static a predefined list of issues supplied by the user is given to the judge as the sole evaluation criteria and mapped directly to evaluation texts, without any dynamic discovery.

Code Example CLEAR can be installed via PyPI:

##### • • •

$ pip install clear -eval

Once installed, the full analysis can be executed with a single CLI command:

##### • • •

$ run-clear -eval -analysis -config_path=<path_to_config >

Or with the next three lines of Python code:

##### • • •

from clear_eval.analysis_runner

import run_clear_eval_analysis config_path = <path -to-config > run_clear_eval_analysis(config_path

)

where <path_to_config> is the path to a YAML file containing the basic configuration options, such as the selected judge and provider, path to input data, path to the results folder, and other optional parameters.

Once processing is complete, the Streamlit interface can be launched using the CLI command below. The results ZIP file saved to the specified output directory can then be manually loaded through the app.

##### • • •

$ run-clear -eval -dashboard

#### 3.2 UI

To support intuitive and effective exploration of model errors, CLEAR includes a visual analytics interface designed for both researchers and practitioners. The user interface (Figure 2) provides multiple synchronized views that together offer a comprehensive understanding of model behavior, error patterns, and their distribution.

The interface is composed of the following key components:

Issues View. The Issues View (Figure 2b) displays an overview of all the issues identified by the system. Each issue is listed along with its frequency and percentage in the dataset. This helps users identify dominant failure patterns at a glance. It also helps the user understand the severity of the presented issues.

Filtering Mechanism. The filtering panel (Figure 2c) enables users to narrow down the dataset based on a specific combination of issue types or score range. We allow the union or intersection of issues or their negation. This is essential for targeted exploration—for example, isolating only high-scoring answers with logical errors, or filtering for responses that demonstrate extractiveness issues. The panel offers dynamic control, and any

applied filters immediately update the rest of the views.

Comparison View. The Comparison View (Figure 2d) visualizes how issue frequencies change when filtering is applied. This comparison allows users to better understand the connection between different issues and, issues and score range.

Model Behavior and Instance-Level View. The bottom row of the interface (Figure 2e, f) focuses on instance-level analysis. Users can drill down into specific examples, inspect the original instruction and response, the judge’s textual feedback, and the list of issues it was mapped to. This direct link between abstract issues and concrete examples can help users understand how different issues effect their system behavior.

Together, these views make CLEAR a tool for analyzing LLM output beyond scalar metrics. The interface supports both broad patterns and finegrained inspection, helping practitioners uncover failure trends, identify brittle behavior, and better understand how model responses fail in practice.

### 4 CLEAR: Case Study

#### 4.1 Setup

To study our method’s behavior, we utilize three datasets: GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021) for math word problems, and two retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) datasets: TechQA (Castelli et al., 2019) and DelucionQA (Sadat et al., 2023), based on the processing of RAGBench (Friel et al., 2024). We run evaluations over four open systems: Mixtral 8x7B (Jiang et al., 2024), LLaMA-3.1 8B (Grattafiori et al., 2024), Granite-3.3 8B (Granite Team, 2024), and Phi-4 (Abdin et al., 2024).

We generate responses for each dataset using these systems and apply our pipeline to assess them. For the judgment component, we employ two strong models in a reference-less setting with general and task-specific modes. As a high-quality closed-source judge, we use GPT-4o (OpenAI et al., 2024), and as an open-source alternative, we use LLaMA-3.3 70B. The per-instance feedback generated by these judges is passed through two versions of the K module: the IBM watsonx® Key Point Analysis (KPA) implementation1, and our LLM-Based KPA using both GPT-4o and LLaMA3.3 70B. This full pipeline produces, for each sys-

#### 4.2 Results

Actionable Insights. Table 1 presents CLEAR results of Mixtral 8x7B evaluated on GSM8K with a task-specific mode. The results reveal that Mixtral 8x7B most prominent weaknesses stem from calculation-related errors. Issues also include incorrect application of mathematical concepts and difficulties in handling units or conversions. These issues can help detect whether a model’s failures stem from reasoning gaps, execution errors, or both.

Importantly, this insight is actionable: developers may choose to augment training data with synthetic examples focusing on numeric reasoning (Yehudai et al., 2024), while users might compensate by pairing the model with external tools like calculators (Qin et al., 2023).

Data Dependent Issues. In the upper part of Table 2 we present the CLEAR results from evaluating Mixtral 8x7B (with J: GPT-4o) on TechQA with a general mode. Issues include missing context, lack of specificity in technical content, and hallucinated or fabricated information—a well-known failure mode of LLMs in RAG settings. Notably, CLEAR demonstrates the ability to adapt issue discovery to both the task and the dataset. For example, the extracted issues explicitly reflect TechQA’s demand for accurate, domain-specific technical details, illustrating how the system tailors feedback to the characteristics of each benchmark.

System Impact. To study how CLEAR behaves across different systems, we analyze results on TechQA for Mixtral 8x7B and Phi-4 (see Table 2). Firstly, we observe that the two systems produce different sets of issues, highlighting that CLEAR provides system-specific diagnostic feedback. For example, Mixtral 8x7B exhibits unique problems such as “Omission of relevant links or references” and “Failure to provide actionable insights or solutions,” which are not observed for Phi-4.

Secondly, we find that the overall proportion of flagged instances is lower for Phi-4, 48.1% for Mixtral 8x7B versus 23.4% for Phi-4. This aligns with the models’ overall quality as reported in the literature: Phi-4 achieves an 84.8 MMLU score (Hendrycks et al., 2021) and a 1257 Elo score on Chatbot Arena (Chiang et al., 2024), compared to Mixtral 8x7B’s 1194 MMLU and 1194 Elo scores. These findings suggest that CLEAR can support high-level system comparisons, in addition to offering fine-grained diagnostic feedback.

Impact of Evaluation Modes. We also compare the use of task-specific and general evaluation modes. Our findings show that the task-specific mode increases CLEAR’s sensitivity to issues closely tied to the task. In contrast, the general mode tends to reveal a broader range of more nuanced or unanticipated problems. For example, on RAG datasets, the task-specific prompt helped to expose more faithfulness-related issues, such as “Generates unsupported or speculative information”, that were

missed by the general prompt. On the other hand, the general mode discovered more novel issues like “Incomplete or abrupt ending of the response”(See appendix C for a full comparison).

Impact of KPA method. Finally, we quantitatively assess the three implementations of the K module for key point analysis. Our results indicate that LLM-based KPA tends to produce issues that are more synthesized and less extractive than the traditional KPA approach. Among the models evaluated, GPT-4o produced more accurate and specific issue types compared to LLaMA-3.3 and Watsonx’s implementation (see Appendix B).

#### 4.3 User study

To evaluate the usefulness and usability of CLEAR for users, we conducted a user study with 12 AI practitioners and researchers. Participants were asked to use the tool on the three datasets, explore the interface, and provide feedback via a structured questionnaire (On a Likert scale) and free-form comments. The assessed dimensions included the usefulness of the tool, comparison to their current practices, and their trust in the tool. (see App. D for a detailed description of the participants, instructions, and questions).

Results. The results indicate that users found CLEAR valuable for surface-level analysis. Specifically, participants appreciated the automation of error detection (noting that 75% currently rely on manual inspection for their use cases), the visual exploration interface, and the potential to detect issues they would have overlooked, with an average rating of 4.33 on a Likert scale. The system was seen as actionable, with 74% of participants reporting they would take or consider taking action based on the output, time-saving, and better than existing practices, with both aspects receiving average scores of 4.25. It was especially valued for identifying common failure modes at scale, with an average score of 4.16.

Despite the generally positive reception, users pointed out areas for improvement. Several responses expressed uncertainty regarding the trustworthiness, 3.83 score, and specificity of the surfaced issues. Some found the descriptions to be vague or had difficulty understanding which errors were most critical. Users also requested features such as severity annotations, clearer categories, automatic summaries, and better highlighting within the textual feedback.

### 5 Related Work

Existing error analysis tools map model errors and abilities by inspecting dataset instances, such as EvalTree’s (Zeng et al., 2025) capability hierarchies or Qualeval’s (Murahari et al., 2023) data attributes. Other methods are interactive, like Erudite (Wu et al., 2019), which requires user labels for clustering errors, or use specialized models like MisattributionLLM (Xu et al., 2025) to score known error types.

Crucially, all these methods depend on labeled data, restricting them to specific tasks. Moreover, as these works probe for weaknesses or skills based on dataset features rather than model-specific behavior, they are likely to miss idiosyncratic model failure modes.

### 6 Conclusion and Future work

We presented CLEAR, a novel framework and interactive tool for automating error analysis of generative AI systems. By leveraging LLMaJ evaluations and Key Point Analysis, CLEAR extracts structured, system-level feedback from instance-level critiques. This enables AI developers to move beyond scalar metrics and surface recurring, actionable failure patterns with minimal manual overhead.

Our experiments across math and RAG datasets demonstrate that CLEAR adapts to different tasks and models, revealing both common and systemspecific issues. The tool offers flexibility in evaluation modes, supports multiple judges and KPA configurations, and includes an intuitive visual interface for deep exploration of model behavior. Our user study confirms the tool’s value for practitioners, highlighting its ability to save time, provide new insights, and improve analysis workflows, though it also points to areas for further enhancement.

Looking ahead, we plan to improve the specificity and clarity of the discovered issues, incorporate severity scoring and prioritization mechanisms, and explore methods for increasing user trust and interpretability. Additionally, we aim to integrate interactive feedback loops that allow users to refine or correct discovered issues.

CLEAR is publicly available, and we hope it will serve the community as a stepping stone toward more transparent, efficient, and insightful evaluation of generative models.

### A Limitations

Our framework’s effectiveness is fundamentally dependent on the quality of its constituent models. The analysis pipeline inherits the biases and potential inaccuracies of both the underlying LLMas-a-Judge (J) and the Key Point Analysis (K) module.

Dependence on Judge Quality The discovered issues are only as reliable as the initial critiques from the judge model. Biases in the judge (e.g., self-bias, length/style bias) or their failure to identify subtle errors directly compromise the quality and validity of the final, aggregated issues.

Scalability and Cost The LLM-based KPA approach, while effective, can be computationally expensive, requiring approximately ∼ 2N LLM calls for a dataset of size N. However, we apply the LLM-based KPA only to instances with low initial evaluation scores, making the cost dependent on the target system’s quality. Nevertheless, this overhead may present a practical limitation for large-scale analyses.

Lack of Causality Our tool identifies and quantifies recurring error patterns but does not diagnose their root cause. For instance, it can highlight frequent factual inaccuracies but cannot distinguish if this stems from knowledge deficits, retrieval failures, or flawed reasoning.

### B Method Comparison

Table 3 presents a qualitative comparison of the key points generated by the three KPA implementations: Watsonx-KPA, LLM-based KPA with LLaMA-3, and LLM-based KPA with GPT-4o. While all three aim to identify recurring systemlevel issues, they differ in terms of abstraction level, phrasing style, and the generality of the resulting key points. Below, we describe two central dimensions of variation we observed across the methods.

Extractive vs. Synthesized Styles. The Watsonx-KPA method produces highly extractive and granular key points, often lifted nearly verbatim from the original feedback. As a result, its issues tend to be overly specific (e.g., “The calculation in step 7 is incorrect”) or tied to particular instance structures. While this precision can surface concrete issues, it reduces generalizability and often results in a long list of narrowly scoped problems. In contrast, LLM-based KPA—especially

with GPT-4o—generates more abstracted and synthesized issue types. These key points aggregate multiple occurrences of related errors into broader categories, such as “Failure to fully consider or correctly interpret all given information”, which promote better generalization across examples and systems.

Issue Granularity and Clarity. LLM-based methods also differ in their balance between abstraction and clarity. The LLaMA-3-based KPA sometimes produces long, compound key points with broad scopes (e.g., “Failure to account for all relevant variables, conditions, or scenarios”), which may reduce readability and introduce redundancy. GPT-4o, on the other hand, tends to produce concise and well-structured key points, striking a balance between informativeness and clarity (e.g.,

“Incorrect handling of units or conversions”). In contrast, Watsonx’s output can feel fragmented or repetitive due to its instance-tethered phrasing, often leading to multiple key points covering overlapping aspects of the same underlying issue.

### C Impact of evaluation mode

Table 4 shows the full list of discovered issues for mixtral 8x7b over the TechQA benchmark, using the general vs. the task-specific evaluation mode, as discussed in paragraph Impact of Evaluation Modes under section §4.2.

### D User Study Details

Among the 12 participants, 7 are application developers, 3 are business analysts, and 1 is a model developer.

To set the context for the study, we began with a brief overview of the tool, followed by step-by-step instructions (see Figure 3).

The questions included a 1-5 Likert-scale, multiple-choice, and open-ended formats, divided into three sections to assess different aspects of the tool:

- 1. Usefulness - This section explores how helpful the tool was in understanding model errors, saving time, or influencing debugging or development decisions (Figure 4).
- 2. Comparative value - This section compares the tool to your current approach—manual inspection or existing tools—and helps identify areas where it adds (or lacks) value (Figure 5).

3. Trust & reliability- This section assesses how much you trust the tool’s outputs and whether it gives you confidence in your understanding of model behavior (Figure 6).

### E Implementation Details

Setup For response generations, all models were prompted with default parameters. For all evaluation stages, inference was performed with temperature 0. The system was set to produce between 3 and 15 key points for each analysis. Issue synthesis was performed using up to 150 evaluation summaries with non perfect scores. All prompts are provided in the Git Repo.
