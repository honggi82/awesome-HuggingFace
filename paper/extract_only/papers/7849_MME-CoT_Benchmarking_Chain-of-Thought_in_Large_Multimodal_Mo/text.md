Answering questions with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has significantly enhanced the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet its impact on Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) still lacks a systematic assessment and in-depth investigation. In this paper, we introduce MMECoT, a specialized benchmark evaluating the CoT reasoning performance of LMMs, spanning six domains: math, science, OCR, logic, space-time, and general scenes. As the first comprehensive study in this area, we propose a thorough evaluation suite incorporating three novel metrics that assess the reasoning quality, robustness, and efficiency at a fine-grained level. Leveraging curated high-quality data and a unique evaluation strategy, we conduct an in-depth analysis of state-of-theart LMMs, uncovering several key insights: 1) Models with reflection mechanism demonstrate a superior CoT quality, with Kimi k1.5 outperforming GPT-4o and demonstrating the highest quality results; 2) CoT prompting often degrades LMM performance on perception-heavy tasks, suggesting a potentially harmful overthinking behavior; and 3) Although the CoT quality is high, LMMs with reflection exhibit significant inefficiency in both normal response and self-correction phases. We hope MME-CoT serves as a foundation for advancing multimodal reasoning in LMMs.

###### 1. Introduction

The emergence of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) (Wei et al., 2022) in Large Language Models (LLMs) has demonstrated promising advances in reasoning capabilities, exemplified

by the recent OpenAI o1 (OpenAI, 2024a) and DeepSeekR1 (Guo et al., 2025a). By engaging in a more deliberate, stepwise reasoning process before reaching a final answer, this methodology presents an effective solution in tackling complex scenarios.

Figure 2: An Overview of MME-CoT. Our benchmark contains a comprehensive CoT evaluation suite with three novel aspects and a meticulously curated dataset encompassing six categories.

In parallel, the multimodal extensions of LLMs, termed Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), have demonstrated remarkable proficiency across diverse visual domains, e.g., general image recognition (Zhang et al., 2023; Zhu et al., 2023; OpenAI, 2023; Zhang et al., 2024a), temporal video understanding (Li et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023), and 3D geometry perception (Guo et al., 2024b; Xu et al., 2023; Guo et al., 2023; Jia et al., 2024). However, to what extent and how much CoT reasoning can benefit multimodal challenges still remains an open question. Although some previous efforts (Zhang et al., 2024c; Yu et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2024d; Guo et al., 2025b) have been made to evaluate the CoT capabilities of LMMs, their examination is insuffi-

ciently systematic and thorough, limiting our understanding of multimodal reasoning and its further development.

To bridge this gap, we propose MME-CoT, a comprehensive and specialized benchmark for evaluating the CoT reasoning skills within LMMs (Figure 2). Our benchmark spans six fundamental domains: math, science, OCR, logic, space-time, and general scenes, encompassing a broad range of CoT-relevant scenarios. Unlike the simplistic metrics used in previous studies, MME-CoT introduces a rigorous evaluation framework that delves into the fine-grained CoT process of LMMs, assessing reasoning quality, robustness, and efficiency. Specifically, we address three critical research questions as follows:

- 1. Is each intermediate CoT step logically valid and faithful without hallucination? The outcome-oriented evaluation paradigm, where most current benchmark adapts, omits the scenario where the model reaches the correct answer through flawed logic or random guess. This causes an illusion of inflated reasoning capabilities in the model. To delve into the reasoning process, we introduce two interpretable metrics to evaluate the Quality of CoT: 1) Recall, which quantifies reasoning informativeness by measuring the proportion of ground-truth solution steps appearing in the response;

2) Precision, which measures faithfulness by evaluating how many of the generated steps are accurate.

- 2. Does CoT interfere with perception tasks, and to what extent does it enhance reasoning tasks? While existing studies primarily focus on the performance improvements CoT brings to reasoning tasks, they often overlook whether CoT could inadvertently disrupt the model’s ability to solve perception tasks that require minimal reasoning. To this end, we present the first investigation into the Robustness of CoT in LMMs. Our benchmark incorporates two task categories (perception and reasoning), and employs two distinct prompting strategies (‘direct answer’ and ‘step-by-step’) to assess two metrics: 1) Stability, which examines whether CoT negatively impacts the model’s performance on direct perception tasks; 2) Efficacy, which measures the extent to which CoT enhances the model’s performance on complex reasoning tasks.
- 3. How can we assess the efficiency of CoT in a long reasoning process? Recent o1-like models have distinguished themselves by employing excessively long CoT and reflection steps. This raises a critical trade-off question: does this approach strike an optimal balance between accuracy and computational cost? To investigate this, we present the first study on the Efficiency of CoT in LMMs. We evaluate efficiency using two key metrics: 1) Relevance Rate, which assesses the proportion of generated content that contributes to answering the question. 2) Reflection Quality, which analyzes whether each reflection step drives the question towards correctness.

Through our systematic evaluation and analysis, we discover that the fine-grained reflection capability greatly enhances the CoT quality, e.g., QVQ achieves F1 Score of 62.0%, largely surpassing Qwen2-VL-72B by 6.8%. Kimi k1.5 beats GPT-4o and achieves the best quality. As for the robustness, we surprisingly find that most models are interfered with by CoT on the perception tasks, implying a harmful overthinking behavior. The worst case happens in InternVL2.5-8B, where we witness a 6.8% degradation

when applying CoT on the perception tasks. This significantly impedes the applicability of models using CoT reasoning as a default practice. Moreover, for CoT efficiency, we notice that not all steps within the long CoT are related to answering the question, and the model could be distracted by the image content, especially when handling general scenes, space-time, and OCR tasks. Around 30% to 40% of reflection steps fail to help answer questions, pointing out critical issues of current models’ reflection capabilities.

The contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:

- • The MME-CoT benchmark is curated, covering a comprehensive scope of six multimodal reasoning scenarios. The data collection and annotation process undergoes rigorous human verification, aiming to provide the community with a high-quality evaluation dataset for multimodal reasoning.
- • We identify critical issues in existing benchmarks, and introduce a thorough evaluation suite specialized for multimodal CoT reasoning, which meticulously examines the reasoning quality, robustness, and efficiency.
- • We conduct extensive experiments and analysis on state-of-the-art LMMs with reasoning capabilities. We summarize our observations and insights, hoping to inspire future advancements of reasoning performance.

###### 2. Dataset Curation

###### 2.1. Data Composition and Categorization.

MME-CoT composes 6 major domains with 17 subcategories, as visualized in Fig. 3. Different from textual reasoning questions, the extra visual input significantly enriches the scope of the visual reasoning questions. With the image input, the model needs to frequently visit the image for relevant information according to current reasoning progress. Describing the image area of interest becomes a crucial part of the CoT process. Thus, in addition to complex problems demanding rigorous logic, commonsense scenarios also pose a challenging reasoning problem, as shown in the general scenes in Fig. 2. To maintain focus on the reasoning process, we exclude questions that require complex domain-specific theorems or specialized knowledge.

In addition, to evaluate CoT robustness detailed in Section 3.2, we incorporate a variety of perception tasks along with the reasoning tasks in the benchmark. The reasoning tasks contain questions that demand multi-step logical inference, while the perception tasks consist of questions that primarily test visual recognition abilities or require very minimal reasoning. Existing benchmarks often conflate these two types of tasks, with perception and reasoning questions frequently appearing within the same categories.

###### Table 1: Key Statistics of MME-COT.

Figure 3: Category and Subcategory Distribution of MME-CoT.

To address this, we implement a two-stage classification approach combining both model-based and human assessment. Initially, we leverage LMMs to guide the preliminary categorization by comparing their performance with and without CoT prompting. We employ GPT-4o (OpenAI, 2024b) and Qwen2-VL-7B (Wang et al., 2024b) to answer questions using both direct and CoT approaches. Superior performance with CoT indicates a reasoning-dominant subcategory, while comparable or inferior CoT performance suggests either perception-focused content or insufficient model reasoning capabilities. The results are shown in Appendix B.2. Subsequently, expert annotators review individual questions to finalize their classification. In total, MME-CoT contains 1,130 questions with 3,865 key step annotation. The detailed statistics of data compositions are shown in Table 1. Please refer to Appendix B for more details about the distribution of data sources.

annotators are required to provide all possible methods. For reference captions, we also ask annotators to verify and correct the details.

###### 3. CoT Evaluation Strategy

Existing benchmarks only focus on evaluating the final answer of the questions, leaving the whole chain of thoughts unvisited. We argue that the CoT process reflects reasoning capability from multiple aspects, serving as a crucial medium to understand LMM’s thinking pattern and deficiency. Here, we present the first holistic CoT evaluation suite to facilitate a comprehensive understanding of the LMMs’ reasoning abilities. We detail the evaluation of correctness in Section 3.1, stability and efficacy in Section 3.2, and reflection quality in Section 3.3.

###### 3.1. CoT Quality Evaluation

###### 2.2. Data Annotation and Review

Existing methods typically rely on state-of-the-art LLMs or LMMs to directly evaluate Chain-of-Thought reasoning based on self-defined criteria, using only the final answer as a reference (Hao et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2024c). We identify two primary issues with the strategy. First, the scoring process only attends to the logical validity of each step, omitting the helpfulness evaluation. Second, there is a large number of complex visual reasoning questions that even the scoring model cannot solve. It is unreasonable for the scoring model to judge another model’s reasoning process on these questions without knowing the ground truth solution process. Therefore, building upon our annotated key steps and reference image captions, we leverage two interpretable metrics to evaluate the CoT correctness: recall and precision (Figure 5). The two metrics respectively attend to the two aspects of the CoT correctness: informativeness and accuracy. We denote the key steps as S = C ∪ I, where C = {c1,...,cM} includes M key inference conclusions

To facilitate CoT evaluation, we provide key steps annotation and reference image captions for all the reasoning questions. Key steps are defined as those that must be done to reach the correct answer. For efficient annotation, we first employ GPT-4o to generate the answer rationale and image captions. For the rationale, we provide both questions and ground truth answers to the model, which yields more accurate rationales compared to question-only prompting. Annotators are then asked to provide key intermediate steps with the help of GPT-4o’s responses. For cases where GPT-4o fails to generate reasonable rationales, annotators develop solutions independently. The intermediate steps fall into two categories: inference conclusion and image caption. Note that the final answer is also included as a concluding inference. All the steps are reduced to the simplest form, retaining only core conclusions and relevant visual element descriptions. Notably, for problems with multiple solutions,

- Triangle CDE is a right triangle with angle CDE = 45°. Triangle EFG is a right triangle with angle EFG = 45°. Triangle EGB is a right triangle with angle EGB = 45°.

- 2. **Use the 45-45-90 Triangle Theorem:**

- - In a 45-45-90 triangle, the sides are in the ratio 1:1:√2.
- - Since DE = EF = 1 m, the hypotenuse EG is 1√2 = √2 m.

- - Since BD = EB + BG, we need to find EB and BG.
- - From the Pythagorean theorem, we have EB² + BG² = 4.
- - Since EB = BG (both are the hypotenuses of the 45-45-90 triangles),

we can write 2EB² = 4.

Figure 4: Illustration of Step Partition. We instruct GPT-4o to divide each step into three categories: image caption, background information, or logical inference. The step partition result is later used to perform step-wise reasoning evaluation. We focus on evaluating the image caption and logical inference steps, which are the keys to visual reasoning.

Image Caption 均匀箭头 + 宽⼀些

and I = {i1,...,iN} includes N key image captions. Recall. We prompt GPT-4o (OpenAI, 2024) to determine whether each key step occurs in the model’s CoT response. Then we calculate the ratio of the matched key steps Smatched against all the annotated key steps:

image caption, and background information. The logical inference step draws an intermediate or final conclusion based on the previously obtained information. The image caption step depicts elements of interest in the image. The background information step states external knowledge or question information. Visual reasoning can be primarily characterized as an interleaved sequence of image captions and logical inferences, so we focus on measuring precision for these two key step types. We assess the correctness of logical inference steps (CP) and image caption steps (IP) using two criteria: 1. If the step exists in S, the step is correct. 2. If the step is logically correct or faithfully depicts the image based on the annotations, the step is also correct. Thus, we compute precision as:

where Sk denotes the kth method of the problem. Intuitively, recall measures how many informative steps are reached by the model. From another perspective, this metric also strictly examines the process’s rigorousness toward reaching the correct answer, eliminating the probability of random guessing. For questions with multiple methods, we compute the recall on the most matched method.

###### 3.2. CoT Robustness Evaluation

direct prompt asks the model to directly provide the final answer, while the CoT prompt instructs the model to perform step-by-step reasoning and finally give the answer. To directly compare the performance difference caused by these two prompts, we conduct the direct evaluation, which only judges the correctness of the final answer, i.e., accuracy. We instruct GPT-4o mini (OpenAI, 2024) to extract the final answer, and then compare it with the ground truth answer, following the two-step procedure introduced in (Zhang et al., 2024c).

Here, we perform the first investigation on the robustness of CoT in visual reasoning. The effectiveness of CoT on reasoning tasks has been verified in many works (Wei et al., 2022; OpenAI, 2024a). However, how CoT impacts visual perception tasks or tasks requiring minimal reasoning still remains unknown. Despite the neglect, this question bears great importance. In real-world applications, what task is given is unknown in advance. Whether the model should perform CoT to solve the task is difficult to determine. In fact, there exists no golden standard to determine which question can benefit from CoT so far (Sprague et al., 2024). Instead of trying to define this criterion, we examine the performance of CoT across all kinds of tasks, both reasoning and perception. We argue that an ideal CoT process should assist in reasoning and not interfere with pure perception. Therefore, it can be applied for any tasks. Based on this, we propose to evaluate two metrics of CoT: stability and efficacy (Figure 6). We leverage two kinds of prompts: the direct prompt (DIR) and the CoT prompt (COT). The

Stability. We define the performance difference of the two prompts on the perception tasks P as the stability score:

Stability = AccPCOT − AccPDIR. (6)

Intuitively, applying the CoT prompt to perception tasks should not degrade performance compared with the direct prompt. Thus, a model with stable CoT should be not less than 0. Otherwise, the model’s thinking process demonstrates inconsistency and harm. The overthinking process pushes over the original correct judgment.

... So I've got this geometry problem here. Let me try to understand what's going on. There's a circle with center O, and there are points A, B, C, D, and E connected in some way. The problem gives me that T equals 80, and the minor arc AB is T/4 degrees. Also, there are angles OAC and OBD given as 10 degrees and 5 degrees, respectively. I need to find the measure of angle AEB.

First, I need to interpret the diagram based on the labels. It seems like E is outside the circle, and lines EC and ED intersect the circle at points C and D, respectively. Points A and B are on the circle, and O is the center.

Given that T = 80, so T/4 = 20 degrees. That means the minor arc AB is 20 degrees. Now, since O is the center, OA and OB are radii of the circle, so they are equal in length.

The stability score measures whether CoT interferes with perception, while the efficacy score assesses the performance gain of CoT on reasoning tasks.

Reflection Quality. The superior reasoning ability could be largely attributed to the reflection and verification process. However, our analysis reveals that not all reflective steps contribute meaningfully to finding correct answers. We identify distinct failure patterns in the reflection process. Some reflective steps mislead the reasoning by introducing new errors or incorrect assumptions, while others are redundant, simply echoing previous conclusions without contributing new insights. To account for failure reflection scenarios, we propose to measure the validity of the reflection. We define a valid reflection as either correctly pointing out the previous mistakes or verifying the previous conclusion with a new insight. Otherwise, the reflection only slows down the reasoning. To instruct GPT-4o to determine all the valid reflection steps R, we list a set of common indicators of the start of the reflection, such as “Wait” and “Alternatively”, and illustrate the definition of valid reflection. For all the valid reflection steps Rvalid, the reflection quality is computed as:

###### 4.1. Experiment Setup

Evaluation Models. We select top-performing LMMs for comprehensive CoT evaluation. We test earlier models such as LLaVA-OneVision (7B, 72B) (Li et al., 2024a), Qwen2-VL (7B, 72B) (Qwen Team, 2024), MiniCPM-V2.6 (Yao et al., 2024b), and InternVL2.5 (8B) (Chen et al., 2024b), which are not trained for the reasoning capability. We also include GPT-4o (OpenAI, 2024b) as a strong baseline model. Besides, we test recent models targeting reasoning, including LLaVA-CoT (11B) (Xu et al., 2024), Mulberry (8B) (Yao et al., 2024a), InternVL2.5-MPO (8B, 78B) (Wang et al., 2024c). Finally, we evaluate LMMs with reflection capabilities, including both closed-source models like Kimi k1.5 (Team et al., 2025) and open-source implementations such as QVQ-72B (Team, 2024) and Virgo72B (Du et al., 2025).

Note that we sample 150 questions from MME-COT to evaluate Kimi k1.5, due to the access limitations. The sample comprises 115 reasoning and 35 perception questions.

###### 4. Experiments

In this section, we conduct a systematic evaluation of stateof-the-art models on MME-COT. We first detail the experiment setup in Section 4.1. Then in Section 4.2, we report the quantitative results and provide valuable insights derived from our analysis.

Implementation Details. We define the CoT prompt as: Please generate a step-by-step answer, include all your intermediate reasoning process, and provide the final answer at the end. and the direct prompt as: Please directly provide the final answer without any other output. We only calculate recall of image observation and logical inference on questions where key inference conclusion or image observation exists. We employ GPT-4o mini for the direct evaluation and GPT-4o for all other criteria. For hyperparameters, we follow the settings in VLMEvalKit (Duan et al., 2024).

###### 4.2. Quantitative Results

We conduct extensive experiments on various LMMs with our proposed CoT evaluation suite. The main results are presented in Table 2 and Table 3. We begin by analyzing the overall performance and then highlight key findings.

Overall Results. In Table 2, we present the overall performance of three CoT evaluation perspectives with specific metrics. To provide a comprehensive understanding, we report precision, recall, and relevance for both logical inference and image caption steps. For robustness, we provide the direct evaluation result on the perception and reasoning tasks, with either CoT or direct prompt. We employ the average value of the stability and efficacy as the final robustness metric. Notably, we define the reflection quality as 100 on models incapable of reflection.

For CoT quality, Kimi k1.5 achieves the highest F1 score. Open-source models with larger sizes consistently demonstrate better performance, highlighting the scalability of LMMs. Notably, Qwen2-VL-72B outperforms all other open-source models without reflection, even surpassing InternVL2.5-78B-MPO, which is specifically enhanced for reasoning. Analysis reveals that GPT-4o achieves superior performance across all recall metrics, while Kimi k1.5 demonstrates the highest scores in precision evaluations. For CoT robustness, Mulberry obtains the highest average score. However, when we look into its output, we find it still generates lengthy rationales despite receiving a direct prompt. Even worse, the direct prompt seems to be an out-of-distribution input for Mulberry, frequently leading to nonsensical outputs. Further analysis of other models’ predictions reveals that LLaVA-CoT, Virgo, QVQ, and Kimi k1.5 similarly neglect the direct prompt, instead generating extended rationales before answering. Consequently, their robustness scores may be misleading. Once again, GPT-4o

achieves the highest robustness score. Among open-source models, only InternVL2.5-MPO, in both its 8B and 78B variants, attains a positive robustness score. Finally, for CoT efficiency, InternVL2.5-8B obtains the maximum relevance of 98.4%, suggesting its consistent focus on questions.

Now, we summarize our key observations as follows:

Models with reflection largely benefit CoT quality. As shown in Table 2, the F1 scores of the two models with reflection capability most closely approach GPT-4o. After specifically fine-tuning for the reasoning capabilities from Qwen2-VL-72B, QVQ surpasses its base model by 5.8%. Notably, although QVQ generates longer CoT sequences than Qwen2-VL-72B, QVQ’s precision still exceeds Qwen2VL-72B by 2.9%, indicating superior accuracy in each reasoning step. Kimi k1.5 also surpasses the previous state-ofthe-art model GPT-4o, obtaining the highest CoT quality.

Long CoT does not necessarily cover key steps. Despite high precision in long CoT models, the informativeness of each step is not guaranteed. We observe that the recall trend among GPT-4o, QVQ, and Virgo does not align with their CoT Rea. performance (i.e., their final answer accuracy on the reasoning tasks under the CoT prompt). Specifically, while both Virgo and QVQ outperform GPT-4o in direct evaluation, they lag behind in recall. This suggests that long CoT models sometimes reach correct answers while skipping intermediate steps, which contradicts the principle of stepwise reasoning and warrants further investigation.

CoT impairs perception task performance in most models. Surprisingly, most models exhibit negative stability scores, indicating that CoT interferes with perception tasks. The most significant degradation occurs in InternVL2.58B, where performance drops by 6.8%. This reveals inconsistency and potential overthinking in current models,

presenting a significant barrier to adopting CoT as the default answering strategy. Among models that provide direct answers, only LLaVA-OV-72B and InternVL2.5-8B-MPO achieve a modest positive score of 0.3%.

Interference 1.8%

Repetition 4.9%

Ineffective Reflection 76.0%

More parameters enable models to grasp reasoning better. We find that models with larger parameter counts tend to achieve higher efficacy scores. This pattern is evident across LLaVA-OV, InternVL2.5-MPO, and Qwen2-VL. For instance, while Qwen2-VL-7B shows a 4.8% decrease in performance when applying CoT to reasoning tasks, its larger counterpart, Qwen2-VL-72B, demonstrates a 2.4% improvement. This discrepancy suggests that models with more parameters could better grasp the reasoning ability under the same training paradigm.

Incompleteness 17.3%

Figure 8: Distribution of Reflection Error Types. We identify four types of error: ineffective reflection, incompleteness, repetition, and interference.

Long CoT models may be more susceptible to distraction. Long CoT models may demonstrate lower relevance scores compared to other models. They frequently generate content unrelated to solving the given question, corresponding to their relatively low recall scores compared to direct evaluation, like QVQ. Although a few models with short CoT, like Mulberry and LLaVA-OV-7B, also obtain a low relevance rate, we find that it is because these models may keep repeating words when dealing with specific type of questions, resulting in irrelevant judgment. The fine-grained metric reveals that models tend to lose focus when describing images, often producing exhaustive captions regardless of their relevance to the question. From Table 3, we find that this phenomenon prevails in general scenes, space-time, and OCR tasks. This behavior can significantly slow inference by generating substantial irrelevant content. Teaching long CoT models to focus on question-critical elements represents a promising direction for future research.

ductive reflection. These patterns are illustrated in Fig. 10 and their distribution is shown in Fig. 8.

The four major error types are:

- • Ineffective Reflection. The model arrives at an incorrect conclusion and, upon reflecting, continues to make incorrect adjustments. This is the most common error type and is also witnessed most frequently.
- • Incompleteness. The model proposes new analytical approaches but does not execute them, only stopping at the initial thought. The reflection slows down the inference process without bringing any gain.
- • Repetition. The model restates previous content or methods without introducing new insights, leading to inefficient reasoning.
- • Interference. The model initially reaches a correct conclusion but, through reflection, introduces errors.

Reflection often fails to help. While reflection is a key feature of long CoT models for answer verification, both QVQ and Virgo achieve reflection quality scores of only about 60%, indicating that approximately 40% of reflection attempts fail to contribute meaningfully to answer accuracy. Even for the closed-source model Kimi k1.5, over 25% reflection steps are also invalid. This substantial failure rate compromises efficiency by potentially introducing unnecessary or distracting steps before reaching correct solutions. Future research should explore methods to reduce these ineffective reflections to improve both efficiency and quality.

Understanding and mitigating these errors is crucial for improving the reliability of LMM reflection mechanisms. The analysis provides the opportunity to focus on solving specific error types to enhance the overall reflection quality.

###### 5. Conclusion

In this paper, we have introduced MME-CoT, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate Chain-of-Thought reasoning in Large Multimodal Models. Our dataset comprises six categories to cover most scenarios of visual reasoning tasks. To gain a thorough understanding of the reasoning process, we design a novel CoT evaluation suite with three metrics. Our systematic evaluation obtains useful insights into the issues within the current state-of-the-art Large Multimodal Models. We identify critical flaws in all the tested

###### 4.3. Error Analysis

In this section, we analyze error patterns in the LMM reflection process. An effective reflection should either correct previous mistakes or validate correct conclusions through new insights. We examined 200 model predictions from QVQ and identified four distinct error types that hinder pro-

open-source models. As the field continues to evolve, MMECoT stands as a valuable tool for measuring progress and identifying areas for improvement in the development of more sophisticated multimodal AI systems.

###### Impact Statement

This paper presents work whose goal is to advance the field of Computer Vision and Machine Learning. There are many potential societal consequences of our work, none of which we feel must be specifically highlighted here.

###### A. Related Work

- A.1. Large Multimodal Models

The field of multimodal (Radford et al., 2021; Li et al., 2022; OpenAI, 2023; 2024b) AI has experienced extraordinary growth, particularly through the development of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) (Liu et al., 2023; Zhu et al., 2023; Lin et al., 2023; Qwen Team, 2024). These models build upon the achievements of Large Language Models (LLMs) (Touvron et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2024) and advanced vision models (Radford et al., 2021), expanding their capabilities to process multiple kinds of visual input (Li et al., 2024b; Guo et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023).

Closed-source models, such as OpenAI’s GPT-4o (OpenAI, 2024b), have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in visual understanding and reasoning. However, their closed-source nature creates barriers to widespread adoption and further development by the broader research community. In response, significant progress has been made in developing open-source alternatives. Early approaches like LLaVA (Liu et al., 2023), LLaMA-Adapter (Zhang et al., 2024b), and MiniGPT-4 (Zhu

- et al., 2023) established a foundation by combining frozen CLIP models for image encoding with LLMs, enabling multimodal instruction tuning. Subsequent developments through projects such as InternVL2 (Chen et al., 2024c), Qwen2-VL (Qwen Team, 2024), SPHINX (Gao et al., 2024; Lin et al., 2023), and MiniCPM-V (Yao et al., 2024b) have expanded these capabilities by incorporating more diverse visual instruction datasets and broadening application scenarios.

Recently, with the introduction of o1 (OpenAI, 2024a), the field of LMMs has also focused on enhancing the reasoning capability. (Wang et al., 2024d) introduces mixed preference optimization with automatically constructed data. (Yao et al., 2024a) proposes to leverage collective knowledge from multiple models to identify effective reasoning paths. Besides, several works (Team, 2024; Du et al., 2025) have demonstrated the ability to replicate behaviors similar to o1 models, particularly regarding multi-step CoT reasoning with iterative self-reflection and verification processes.

A.2. Reasoning Evaluation

Several methods have been developed to evaluate reasoning in natural language processing, including ROSCOE (Golovneva et al., 2022) and ReCEval (Prasad et al., 2023), which assess reasoning chains across multiple dimensions such as correctness and informativeness. However, these approaches are limited to text-only scenarios and do not address the unique challenges present in visual reasoning tasks. Furthermore, the emergence of long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has introduced additional considerations, such as output efficiency and reflection quality, which existing evaluation methods do not adequately address.

On the other hand, various multimodal benchmarks have been developed to assess reasoning abilities across specific domains. Current exploration of visual reasoning predominantly focuses on the mathematics (Zhang et al., 2024d; Peng

- et al., 2024) domains. MathVista (Lu et al., 2023) provides a comprehensive collection of mathematical problems that assess mathematical and logical reasoning abilities. Building on this, MathVerse (Zhang et al., 2024c) introduces a new benchmark by eliminating redundant textual information to evaluate whether LMMs can accurately interpret graphical representations. OlympiadBench (He et al., 2024) further raises the complexity bar by incorporating challenging Olympiad-level mathematics and physics problems. Despite these advances in specialized domains, broader applications such as general-scene reasoning remain relatively unexplored. Recent developments have begun to expand beyond purely scientific reasoning. For instance, M³CoT (Chen et al., 2024a) and SciVerse (Guo et al., 2024a) incorporate commonsense tasks alongside scientific reasoning and knowledge-based assessment in the multimodal benchmark. However, most existing benchmarks focus solely on evaluating final answers while overlooking the intermediate steps, thus providing limited insights into the process through which models arrive at their conclusions.

Looking back at the images, the street appears to be horizontal in the aerial view, with the yellow car moving from left to right. Therefore, the sequence should be first image (left), second image (middle), third image (right). Since none of the options match this sequence, the answer must be B. none of the choices provided. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects a different perspective. Wait, maybe the street is not horizontal but vertical. If the street is vertical, with the yellow car moving from top to bottom, then the sequence would be first image (top), third image (middle), second image (bottom). Again, none of the options match this sequence.

= 151 days. Now, to find the average monthly weight gain, perhaps I need to consider the average per month based on the number of days.

But that seems unnecessary. Since the weight was measured at the beginning and the end, using months as the time unit should be sufficient.

Alternatively, maybe the problem wants the average daily weight gain, and then convert it to monthly gain. 6.4 kg / 151 days = approximately 0.0424 kg per day.

[Figure 242]

Repeated Reasoning

[Figure 243]

- 0.0424 kg/day * 30 days/month = approximately 1.27 kg/month. That's roughly 1.27 kg per month, which is close to my earlier calculation of
- 1.28 kg per month.

... If angle 1 is 140°, then perhaps there's a triangle involved where the sum of angles is 180°. Let me see: if I have a triangle with angles 40°, 35°, and angle 3 (let's say), then angle 3 would be 180° - 40° - 35° = 105°. If angle 1 is corresponding to angle 3, then it should also be 105°, but according to my earlier calculation, angle 1 is 140°.

Correct Answer

Reflection

... Let’s consider that f(n,k) is a combinatorial number, and since it‘s related to binomial coefficients, perhaps I can use Lucas’ theorem to determine when f(n,k) is divisible by a prime p. Lucas‘ theorem states that C(m,p^e) ≡ C(m_p, e_p) mod p, where m_p and e_p are the digits in base p of m and e. However, applying Lucas' theorem directly to f(n,k) is complicated due to the circular adjacency constraints.

[Figure 249]

Wrong Answer

Hmm, there's inconsistency here. Maybe I need to approach this differently. If angle between lines "a" and "b" is 180° - 40° = 140°, then angle 1, being corresponding to that angle, should also be 140°.

###### Prediction:

To find the length of DE in the image provided, we need to carefully analyze the two given triangles: triangle ABC and triangle DEF. The problem involves using the concept of **similar triangles** since the triangles share the same angles, which makes their corresponding sides proportional. ### Step 1: Confirm the similarity of the triangles From the diagram: 1. Both triangle ABC and triangle DEF have a 90 degrees angle (right triangles). 2. The pink arcs indicate that one of the other angles in triangle ABC is equal to one of the angles in triangle DEF. 3. Since the angles of a triangle add up to 180degrees, the third angles must also be equal. This means triangle ABC sim triangle DEF (the two triangles are similar). ### Step 2: Use the property of similar triangles For similar triangles, the sides are proportional. That is: \[ \frac{AB}{DE} = \frac{BC}{EF} = \frac{AC}{DF}. \] From the diagram: - In triangle ABC : - AB = 45 BC = 15 - In triangle DEF: - EF = 3 - DF = x We must find DE, so we will use the side ratio: \[ \frac{AB}{DE} = \frac{BC}{EF}. \] ### Step 3: Substitute known values Substituting the values into the proportion: \[ \frac{45}{DE} = \frac{15}{3}. \] Simplify the ratio on the right-hand side: \[ \frac{45}{DE} = 5. \] ### Step 4: Solve for DE Rearrange the equation to solve for DE: \[ DE = \frac{45}{5}. \] Simplify: \[ DE = 9. \] ### Final Answer: The length of DE is: 9.

Answer: D. 9

QVQ-72B-Preview:

###### Prediction:

So, I've got this geometry problem here, and I need to find the length of DE. Let's see what information is given. There are two triangles: one is ADE, and the other is ABC. From the diagram, it looks like triangle ADE is similar to triangle ABC because they have corresponding angles that are equal. Specifically, angle D in triangle ADE corresponds to angle A in triangle ABC, angle E in triangle ADE corresponds to angle B in triangle ABC, and angle F in triangle ADE corresponds to angle C in triangle ABC. Wait, actually, looking closer, triangle ADE is similar to triangle ABC, with angle D corresponding to angle A, angle E corresponding to angle B, and angle F corresponding to angle C. But in the diagram, it's labeled as points D, E, F for triangle ADE, and points A, B, C for triangle ABC. Hmm, maybe I need to be careful with the labeling. Let's look at the coordinates or the labels again. In triangle ADE, points are D, E, F, and in triangle ABC, points are A, B, C. There's a side labeled FE with length 3, and sides BC and DE are to be compared. Wait, no. In triangle ADE, sides are DE, DF, and EF, with EF being 3 units. In triangle ABC, sides are AB, BC, and AC, with BC being 15 units and AB being 45 units. There's also an angle in triangle ABC that's 90 degrees, specifically angle C is 90 degrees, since there's a red square at point C, which typically denotes a right angle. So, triangle ABC is a right-angled triangle with right angle at C, AB is 45 units, and BC is 15 units. Now, since triangle ADE is similar to triangle ABC, their corresponding sides are proportional. First, I need to identify which sides correspond to each other. Given that angle F in triangle ADE corresponds to angle C in triangle ABC, and angle C is the right angle, so angle F must also be the right angle in triangle ADE. Wait, but in triangle ADE, angles D, E, and F are all acute in the diagram, so maybe that's not the case. Actually, perhaps I misread the diagram. Let's assume that triangle ADE is similar to triangle ABC, with angle at A being common to both. But in the diagram, it seems like triangle ADE is positioned with point A at the origin, and triangle ABC is another triangle with point A shared. Wait, perhaps point A is the common vertex. Let me try to rephrase the problem based on the diagram description. Points D, E, F form a triangle with EF = 3 units. Points A, B, C form another triangle with BC = 15 units and AB = 45 units, and angle at C is 90 degrees. There's a line from A to C, and another line from A to E. Wait, maybe I need to consider the similarity ratio between the two triangles. Since triangle ADE is similar to triangle ABC, the ratio of their corresponding sides should be equal. Let’s denote the lengths: Let DE = x (which is what we need to find) EF = 3 units In triangle ABC, BC = 15 units, AB = 45 units, and angle C = 90 degrees. Wait, but in triangle ADE, which sides correspond to which sides in triangle ABC? If angle at D corresponds to angle at A, angle at E corresponds to angle at B, and angle at F corresponds to angle at C, then: DE corresponds to AB, DF corresponds to AC, and EF corresponds to BC. Therefore, the ratio of corresponding sides is DE / AB = DF / AC = EF / BC. But we don't know the length of DF or AC. Wait, perhaps I need to find another way. Since triangle ABC is a right-angled triangle with right angle at C, and sides BC = 15 and AB = 45, I can find AC using the Pythagorean theorem. In triangle ABC: AB² = AC² + BC² 45² = AC² + 15² 2025 = AC² + 225 AC² = 2025 225 = 1800 AC = sqrt(1800) = sqrt(100*18) = 10*sqrt(18) = 10*3*sqrt(2) = 30*sqrt(2) So, AC = 30*sqrt(2) Now, since triangle ADE is similar to triangle ABC, with DE corresponding to AB, DF corresponding to AC, and EF corresponding to BC. Therefore, the ratio DE / AB = DF / AC = EF / BC We can write: x / 45 = DF / (30*sqrt(2)) = 3 / 15 Simplify 3 / 15: that's 1 / 5 So, x / 45 = 1 / 5 Therefore, x = 45 * (1 / 5) = 9 So, DE = 9 units Therefore, the correct choice is D:9 **Final Answer**: D.

###### Prediction:

To determine which object (Object 1 or Object 2) is healthier based on their appearance in the image, let's follow a systematic approach and analyze the information step by step. ### Step 1: **Understand the context** The focus of the question is to assess healthiness specifically based on appearance. This means we cannot consider factors like portion size, preparation method, or nutritional values that aren't visible in the image. ### Step 2: **Examine Object 1 (orange rectangle)** - Object 1 is a bowl of what appears to be a seafood dish, possibly containing shellfish (such as mussels, clams, or shrimp), and some visible vegetables like tomatoes. - Observations: - Seafood is generally considered healthy as it can be low in saturated fat and rich in nutrients like omega-3 fatty acids, vitamins, and minerals. - The inclusion of vegetables (tomatoes in this case) adds to its nutritional value, providing vitamins and fiber. - However, we cannot tell the exact cooking method used. If it’s fried or cooked with excessive oil, cream, or butter, it might reduce its healthiness. ### Step 3: **Examine Object 2 (blue rectangle)** - Object 2 appears to be a plate of fried or sautéed meat or poultry. - Observations: - From the appearance, it seems that the food in Object 2 is fried or cooked in oil, which may increase its saturated fat content. - There are no visible vegetables or fruits in the dish, which makes it likely less balanced in terms of nutrients compared to Object 1. - Additionally, fried foods are generally considered less healthy when consumed in excess due to their high calorie and fat content. ### Step 4: **Compare the two objects**- Based on appearance, Object 1 likely contains lean proteins from seafood and includes vegetables, which makes it a more nutrient-dense option. - Object 2 seems heavier on oils or fats due to the fried presentation and lacks visible vegetables or a balance of food groups. - We are relying on visible attributes, and thus, there is some uncertainty since we don’t have information about portion size, seasoning (e.g., salt), or preparation (e.g., sauces). ### Step 5: **Consider the limitations of appearance** - It’s important to note that determining healthiness solely based on appearance has limitations. Cooking methods, hidden ingredients, and the full nutritional profile are not always evident. ### Final Answer:**A. Object 1** appears healthier based on visible factors, such as the inclusion of seafood and vegetables. However, this is a visual assessment and may not reflect exact healthiness. If the ambiguity of appearance is prioritized, the answer could alternatively be **D. It's impossible to determine healthiness based on appearance alone.**

QVQ-72B-Preview:

###### Prediction:

Alright, I've got this question here. There are two objects, each within a colored rectangle: one in orange and one in blue. The task is to determine which one is healthier. The options are A. Object 1 (orange rectangle), B. Object 2 (blue rectangle), C. Both are equally healthy, or D. It's impossible to determine based on appearance alone. First, I need to understand what's in each rectangle. Object 1 is in the orange rectangle. From the description, it sounds like a breakfast setup. There's a plate with what appears to be yogurt topped with fruits like bananas, strawberries, and possibly blueberries, along with some granola. There's also a glass of iced tea, a mug of coffee, and some roasted potatoes in the background. Object 2 is in the blue rectangle. It's a plate of roasted potatoes. So, the comparison is between a fruit and granola yogurt bowl and a plate of roasted potatoes. Now, I need to assess which of these is healthier. Let's consider the nutrients each provides. The yogurt bowl with fruits and granola: - Yogurt is a good source of protein and calcium. - Bananas provide potassium and vitamin C. - Strawberries and blueberries are rich in antioxidants and vitamin C. - Granola can vary, but it often contains oats, which are high in fiber, and possibly nuts or seeds for healthy fats and additional protein. The roasted potatoes: Potatoes are a source of carbohydrates, vitamin C, and potassium. - How they're roasted matters: if it's with minimal oil and seasoning, they can be quite healthy. However, if they're deeply fried or cooked with a lot of fat, they might be higher in unhealthy fats. Given that, the yogurt bowl seems to offer a more balanced meal with a combination of protein, carbohydrates, fiber, and vitamins from the fruits and granola. The roasted potatoes, while they can be part of a healthy diet, especially if prepared healthily, don't provide as diverse a range of nutrients as the yogurt bowl. Moreover, depending on the preparation, the potatoes might be higher in calories from fat compared to the yogurt bowl. But, to be fair, if the potatoes are roasted with very little oil, they could still be quite healthy. However, in general, the yogurt bowl with fruits and granola is likely to be a healthier choice due to its nutrient density and diversity. Therefore, my answer would be A. Object 1. But I should consider if there's any way that the potatoes could be healthier in some scenarios. For example, if the granola is high in sugar or if the portion sizes are not considered, the potatoes might be a better option in those specific cases. But, based on the visual information provided, the yogurt bowl looks well-balanced and nutritious. So, I think A. Object 1 is the correct answer. **Final Answer** A.

###### Prediction:

Alright, I've got this question here. It says, "How many puppies are sticking out their tongues in each image?" And there are two images provided. Okay, so I need to look at both images and count how many puppies are sticking out their tongues in each one. First, let's look at the first image. There's a corgi puppy sitting on an orange blanket against a wooden background with some decorative metalwork. The puppy has a tri-color coat—white, black, and tan—and it's wearing a black collar. Its tongue is not sticking out. So, in this image, the number of puppies with their tongues out is zero. Now, moving on to the second image. This one features another corgi puppy, this time against a purple fabric background. This puppy also has a tri-color coat and is looking directly at the camera. I need to check if its tongue is sticking out. Hmm, from what I can see, the puppy's mouth is closed, and there's no tongue visible. So, again, zero puppies with their tongues out in this image. Wait a minute, the question says "each image," and there are two images. So, for each image, I need to count the number of puppies sticking out their tongues. In both images, there's only one puppy, and neither of them is sticking out their tongue. So, for both images, the count is zero. But let's double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing. In the first image, the puppy is clearly not showing its tongue. In the second image, similarly, no tongue is visible. So, I think it's safe to say that in each image, there are zero puppies sticking out their tongues. Looking back at the options provided: A . Zero, B. Two, C. Three, D. None of the choices provided, E. Four. Since in each image, the number is zero, and there are two images, but the question specifies "in each image," so the answer should be A. Zero. Wait, but maybe there's a trick here. Maybe "each image" refers to all images combined. But no, the question specifically says "in each image," so I think it's asking for the number per image, not in total across all images. So, my final answer is A. Zero. Final Answer: A. 0

Prediction:

Now, triangle FBD has a right angle at B, so B is somewhere on FD, I think. Wait, no, FD is the bottom side of the rectangle. But if FBD is a triangle with vertices at F, B, and D, and it's right-angled at B, then B must be one of the endpoints, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe B is not on FD. Similarly, triangle AEC is right-angled at E, and E is on FD, perhaps. Wait, maybe I need to think differently. Since AC = 200 and CD = 50, and the triangles are congruent right-angled triangles, perhaps the legs of these triangles are equal in length. Let’s denote the legs of the right-angled triangles. Let’s say, for triangle FBD, FB and BD are the legs, and for triangle AEC, AE and EC are the legs. Given that the triangles are congruent, FB = EC and BD = AE. But since both triangles are right-angled and congruent, their corresponding sides must be equal. Wait, but I need to find the area of the shaded region, which is the overlapping area of these two triangles. Maybe I should find the area of one triangle and then double it, and then subtract the non-overlapping parts. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the area of the intersection directly. Let me try to find the equations of the lines that form the triangles to find their intersection points.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Evaluate relevancy independent of correctness. As long as the step is trying to get to a solution, it is considered relevant. Logical fallacy, knowledge mistake, inconsistent with previous steps, or other mistakes do not affect relevance. A logically wrong step can be relevant if the reasoning attempts to address the question.

The following behaviour is considered as relevant:

- i. The step is planning, summarizing, thinking, verifying, calculating, or confirming an intermediate/final conclusion helpful to get a solution.
- ii. The step is summarizing or reflecting on previously reached conclusion relevant to get a solution.
- iii. Repeating the information in the question or give the final answer.
- iv. A relevant image depiction should be in one of following situation:

- 1. help to obtain a conclusion helpful to solve the question later;
- 2. help to identify certain patterns in the image later;
- 3. directly contributes to the answer

- v. Depicting or analyzing the options of the question is also relevant.
- vi. Repeating previous relevant steps are also considered relevant. The following behaviour is considered as irrelevant:

- i. Depicting image information that does not related to what is asking in the question. Example: The question asks how many cars are present in all the images. If the step focuses on other visual elements like the road or building, the step is considered as irrelevant.
