### Abstract

To survive and thrive in complex environments, humans have evolved sophisticated self-improvement mechanisms through environment exploration, hierarchical abstraction of experiences into reuseable skills, and collaborative construction of an ever-growing skill repertoire. Despite recent advancements, autonomous web agents still lack crucial self-improvement capabilities, struggling with procedural knowledge abstraction, skill refinement, and skill composition. In this work, we introduce SKILLWEAVER, a skill-centric framework that enables agents to self-improve by autonomously synthesizing reusable skills as APIs. Given a new website, the agent autonomously discovers skills, executes them for practice, and distills practice experiences into robust APIs. Iterative exploration continuously expands a library of lightweight, plug-and-play APIs, significantly enhancing the agent’s capabilities. Experiments on WebArena and real-world websites demonstrate the efficacy of SKILLWEAVER, achieving relative success rate improvements of 31.8% and 39.8%, respectively. Additionally, APIs synthesized by strong agents substantially enhance weaker agents through transferable skills, yielding improvements of up to 54.3% on WebArena. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of honing diverse website interactions into APIs, which can be seamlessly shared among various web agents.1

### 1 Introduction

AI agents based on large language models (LLMs) that can browse the web (Deng et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2024a; Zheng et al., 2024) or use computers (Xie et al., 2024) like humans are rapidly rising as a new frontier of AI research and application. Despite these promising opportunities, digital environments present substantial challenges due to their inherent complexity and diversity. Website environments are highly intricate, consisting of numerous interactive elements that create large action spaces. An even greater challenge lies in developing generalist web agents capable of generalizing to out-of-distribution task types and adapting to novel websites. Existing efforts have attempted to train web agents using large-scale trajectory datasets collected across diverse websites and task types (Li et al., 2024; Pahuja et al., 2025). However, these agents often struggle with overfitting to specific website structures and task distributions (Li et al., 2024; Zheng et al., 2024), reducing their ability to handle previously unseen environments effectively.

As an integral feat of human intelligence, self-improvement presents a promising solution to these challenges. Imagine a user visiting ‘yelp.com’ for the first time. In the beginning, she may not be familiar with the layout and functionalities provided by the website, so she

Figure 1: An overview of the SKILLWEAVER framework. The Skill Proposal module (Stage I) identifies novel skills to practice based on observations of the environment and available APIs in the skill library. For each proposed skill, the agent executes it to generate trajectories, which are later evaluated by the reward model. If successful, the trajectory is utilized to synthesize an API (Stage II). To ensure robustness, the synthesized API undergoes testing with automatically generated test cases and debugging within the Skill Honing module (Stage III).

would explore the website and think about what tasks can be done. As she does more tasks on the website (e.g., searching for restaurants with various filters), common routines become memorized procedural knowledge (e.g., searching for high-end Korean restaurants entails three steps: type ‘Korean’ in the top search bar, click the ‘Search’ button shaped like a magnifier, and click the ‘$$$$’ button on the search result page). Such routines abstracted from experiences essentially become high-level actions or skills that can be effortlessly summoned and carried out instead of re-learning things on the fly; they can even be composed into more complex routines, e.g., making a reservation at a restaurant involves first finding it. Similarly, through self-improvement, agents can build conceptual maps of the website environment, accumulate procedural knowledge as skills, compose simple skills into more complex ones, and leverage these learned skills to enhance their decision-making processes.

A few recent studies have tried to capture some facets of humans’ self-improvement capability. Traditional methods typically store skills implicitly through action trajectories, primarily leveraging them as demonstrations for in-context learning (Murty et al., 2024b) or fine-tuning (Murty et al., 2024a; Su et al., 2025; Pahuja et al., 2025). Although these trajectory-based approaches can be effective, they struggle to explicitly abstract reusable procedural knowledge, resulting in heavy training demands and limited generalization to new websites and tasks. Furthermore, continuously updating models with new trajectories introduces significant concerns such as catastrophic forgetting and sensitivity to website changes. Additionally, storing and sharing extensive memory-intensive trajectory data also poses practical challenges for knowledge transfer among agents.2 Efforts like Agent Workflow Memory (Wang et al., 2024e) and ICAL (Sarch et al., 2024) take this a step further by generating abstract, reusable routines. However, its natural language-based routines pose challenges for formal verification and precise composition into new workflows. Both methods also focus on online learning with access to test queries or offline learning requiring high-quality annotated demonstrations. Instead, we focus on more challenging autonomous exploration where agents propose novel tasks without external supervision.

To this end, we propose SKILLWEAVER, a skill-centric framework that enables web agents to autonomously self-improve by exploring website environments and synthesizing reusable, structured skills (§ 2). Our framework leverages the ability of LLMs to iteratively curate APIs based on feedback from the interactive environment (Wang et al., 2023a; 2024d). Specifically, SKILLWEAVER comprises a three-stage pipeline (Figure 1): (1) systematic exploration of website environments to identify potential skills, (2) practicing and converting these skills

2For example, screenshot and HTML files consume approximately 0.3 GB per trajectory with an average of 7.3 actions in Mind2Web (Deng et al., 2023), making them hard to transfer on the fly.

into robust, reusable APIs, and (3) testing and debugging to ensure API reliability during inference.

Results on WebArena (Zhou et al., 2024a) demonstrate substantial performance improvements after equipping web agents with APIs synthesized by SKILLWEAVER. We observe relative gains in success rate from 25% to 38% with just 160 iterations of the three-stage pipeline. Further experiments with weaker agents revealed even more dramatic improvements, ranging from 40% to 130%. These results underscore two insights: (1) synthesized APIs can substantially enhance agent performance, and (2) weaker agents particularly benefit from APIs generated by more powerful counterparts, effectively distilling advanced knowledge into plug-and-play modules. To further validate the practicality of our method, we conduct experiments on real-world websites using tasks sampled from Online-Mind2Web (Xue et al., 2025; Deng et al., 2023). SKILLWEAVER achieved a 39.8% relative improvement in success rate, demonstrating its effectiveness in complex, dynamic web environments.

### 2 SkillWeaver

Our objective is to develop a framework that enables web agents to autonomously discover skills and construct a continuously expanding skill library in the form of APIs. In our work, “API” refers to a Python function containing Playwright code for a browser automation, rather than a (for example) REST API that handles HTTP requests. As illustrated in Figure 1, the exploration pipeline consists of three key modules: (1) Skill Proposal: Identifying new skills (e.g., a short description such as “Identify pill using pill identifier”) for the agent to practice, facilitating the continuous discovery of relevant functionalities; (2) Skill Synthesis: Practicing the proposed skills and converting practiced trajectories into reusable Python functions, encapsulating learned behaviors into structured APIs; (3) Skill Honing: Testing and debugging the synthesized APIs using feedback from the environment and the reward model to ensure reliability.

#### 2.1 Stage I: Skill Proposal

Website environments encompass numerous underlying functionalities that require systematic exploration. LLMs have been employed as automatic curriculum (Tajwar et al., 2025) for exploring open-ended environments, like Minecraft (Wang et al., 2023a; Du et al., 2023), TextWorld (Song et al., 2024a), and household settings (Du et al., 2023). Similarly, we leverage LLMs as an automatic curriculum for discovering website functionalities, leveraging their internet-scale knowledge and HTML interpretation capabilities. To facilitate the understanding of website environments, we provide LLMs with detailed webpage observations, including screenshots, website names, URLs, and accessibility trees. Accessibility trees are particularly useful for understanding less familiar websites, such as CMS in WebArena, because they provide comprehensive structural and functional information.

In contrast to existing approaches (Zhou et al., 2024b; Murty et al., 2024b;a; Song et al., 2024a), we emphasize skill diversity by explicitly prompting LLMs to propose novel and reusable skills beyond the current skill repertoire. To ensure efficient exploration and high success rates in subsequent skill practice and API synthesis stages, we specifically target short-horizon, reusable skills that can be completed within a single API call. Our approach follows a curriculum progression from simple to complex skill compositions. The LLM is instructed to propose the following three types of tasks (Prompts in Appendix § A.1):

Procedural Tasks. Procedural tasks require a sequence of atomic actions to achieve higherlevel process automation objectives. Each procedural task corresponds to a workflow comprising actions that can be generalized to complete similar tasks. For example, the task identifying pills based on imprint and color involves a workflow where values are entered into textboxes, followed by clicking a submit button to finalize the search operation.

Navigational Tasks. Navigational tasks involve systematically exploring various sections or pages within a website. Through these tasks, agents can construct conceptual maps that capture the functionality of various webpages within the website. Examples include

navigating to the ”customer reviews” section on a product management website and accessing individual user profiles.

Information-Seeking Tasks. Information-seeking tasks involve scraping detailed data from webpages (e.g., extracting all commits from a GitHub repository). Enumerating all available items on webpages, such as comprehensive lists of reviews or faculty members, is typically challenging and requires extensive, repetitive actions. To address this challenge, generating specialized scraping APIs enables agents to efficiently retrieve all relevant information.

#### 2.2 Stage II: Skill Synthesis

This module aims at automatically generating robust and reusable APIs, consisting of the following three components: Skill Practice, Reward Model, and API Synthesis. A critical challenge in this process is ensuring the robustness of the generated APIs, as each individual module may introduce errors. We address this challenge through curriculum progressionadvancing from simple to complex skill compositions—which improves accuracy since modules perform better on simpler tasks requiring fewer steps. Additionally, the subsequent Skill Honing module (Stage III) validates APIs through unit testing and debugging to ensure reliability.

Skill Practice. Given a task proposed in Stage I, the agent takes actions to complete it. For procedural and navigational tasks, we leverage a base agent to generate actions to repeatedly attempt to complete tasks. The agent repeatedly attempts to complete the tasks proposed in the previous section, using the reward model to determine successful completion. For information-seeking tasks, we synthesize data extraction code to gather target information from webpages, incorporating any necessary navigation steps, such as retrieving historical orders or customer information.

Reward Model. LLMs have demonstrated effectiveness as evaluators of correctness, both for answer accuracy (Zheng et al., 2023) and for determining whether action sequences successfully complete task instructions (Pan et al., 2024; Zhuge et al., 2024). We prompt an LLM to provide reward signals indicating task completion success with the following observations in the context: (1) Task description, (2) Action trajectory comprising a sequence of actions with screenshots and corresponding descriptions, (3) Environmental feedback, including code execution outcomes and observable website changes. Further details can be

- found in Appendix § A.5.

API Synthesis. This module encapsulates the agent’s actions from successful trajectories into a reusable and generalized API. This is performed by creating a string representation of each of the state-action pairs in the trajectory and prompting the language model to generate a Python implementation. We statically analyze the function for common generation mistakes, as described in Appendix § A.6, and if any are detected, we prompt the model to generate the function again. As illustrated in Figure 2, each API includes a Python implementation (including a function signature, docstring, and code body), where the docstring particularly contains a usage log recording previous executions of the function and a description of the prerequisite state

of the website for the function to execute without errors.

#### 2.3 Stage III: Skill Honing

Despite significant efforts within the above modules to ensure the robustness of the synthesized API, it is not always guaranteed. To address this limitation, we integrate a stage to test and debug synthesized APIs. For APIs requiring no extra parameters except the by default Playwright page instance, we execute the API directly as a standalone unit test. For APIs requiring additional parameters, we leverage the LLM to generate appropriate parameter values that serve as comprehensive test cases.

### 3 Experiments

We conducted experiments on both WebArena (Zhou et al., 2024a) and real-world live websites to evaluate our agent. WebArena is a widely used benchmark for web agent evaluation, providing a diverse set of websites designed to simulate real-world web interactions. Real-world websites further demonstrate the performance of our method in more diverse, dynamic, and complex website environments. We perform exploration on each website environment separately to derive the API library, as described in Section § 3.4.

#### 3.1 WebArena

WebArena is a self-hostable, sandboxed web environment designed for developing and evaluating web agents. It simulates real-world websites across five common application domains: e-commerce (Shopping), social forums (Reddit), collaborative software development (Gitlab), content management (CMS), and navigation (Map). This benchmark includes a total of 812 tasks, each with automated evaluation metrics based on functional correctness. WebArena provides a stable testing environment with reliable automatic evaluation, making it a good platform for demonstrating the efficacy of our agent and analyzing various aspects of our approach. Further details on the WebArena benchmark used in our evaluation can be found in Appendix § B.

Human-Crafted APIs. The self-hosted WebArena sandbox environment grants access to its source code and administrative access for the simulated websites. This enables us to extract APIs that adhere to standardized protocols (e.g., REST) from the official documentation within the source code as well as from external sources (Song et al., 2024a). We further leverage these human-crafted official APIs to compare them against the APIs synthesized by SKILLWEAVER, demonstrating the quality of the generated APIs.

#### 3.2 Real-World Websites

Real-world websites present greater complexity and richness than simulated environments. To demonstrate the practicality and efficacy of our approach in real-world environments, we conduct evaluations on live websites. Specifically, we use Online-Mind2Web (Xue et al., 2025; Deng et al., 2023), a benchmark specifically designed for evaluating web agents on live websites. This benchmark encompasses 300 tasks across 136 popular websites spanning diverse domains. The tasks represent realistic scenarios commonly encountered in daily web interactions, as proposed by human annotators. Considering the cost of exploration on all the websites, we only consider websites with a sufficient number of tasks that can be accessed by Playwright. We end up with 4 websites that have at least 8 tasks to run online evaluations (Zheng et al., 2024; Yoran et al., 2024; He et al., 2024) and include 57 tasks, listed in Appendix § C. To ensure the validity of evaluation, we manually evaluate the success of agent trajectories. Specifically, we verify whether the actions fulfill all requirements posed by the task and whether retrieved information matches the target for information-seeking tasks.

#### 3.3 Agent Implementation

By default, we use GPT-4o3 with a temperature of 0.3. Following the default WebArena evaluation settings, we set the maximum number of steps per iteration to 10.

Baseline Agent. We implement a web agent with only browsing actions based on CodeAct (Wang et al., 2024b), which leverages an LLM to generate Python code using the Playwright browser automation library to interact with web environments through simple atomic actions such as click, type, and scroll. The observation space consists of webpage screenshots, an accessibility tree, and the execution results from previous actions, such as exceptions.

Agent with Skills. To demonstrate the performance improvements gained from APIs, we extend the action space of the baseline agent by incorporating synthesized skills, enabling the agent to execute API calls. We leverage this agent to evaluate the performance improvements from both APIs synthesized by SKILLWEAVER and human-crafted APIs (Song et al., 2024b) from WebArena’s official documentation. Given the extensive number of synthesized APIs, we introduce an API selection module that filters only relevant APIs from the API library. This module also removes APIs that do not satisfy pre-conditions. The prompt and skill serialization format can be found in Appendix § A.8.

Weaker Agent. To evaluate whether the synthesized APIs can plug and play in weaker agents, we implement a weaker variant by replacing GPT-4o with GPT-4o-mini4 while maintaining the same agent design.

#### 3.4 Exploration

During the exploration stage, we employ the agent described above to practice skills. Each website undergoes an exploration process consisting of 160 iterations with GPT-4o, where an iteration is defined as either attempting a proposed skill or testing an existing skill. Within each iteration, the agent proposes either a procedural or navigational task at the starting webpage. It can also propose an information-seeking task at the ending webpage after completing the procedural or navigational task in the previous iteration. During exploration, the agent can access APIs synthesized in the previous exploration steps after skill selection to compose more complex APIs.

### 4 Results and Analysis

#### 4.1 Experimental Results

WebArena Results. Our experiments on WebArena demonstrate consistent performance improvements with the integration of synthesized APIs. As illustrated in Table 1, we observe a substantial relative improvement in success rate, 39.8% on average, for the baseline agent with GPT-4o and an even larger improvement of 54.3% with GPT-4o-mini across the evaluated websites.

When compared to AutoEval (Pan et al., 2024), which leverages an LLM-based reward model to guide inference-time exploration, SKILLWEAVER achieves higher average success rates and exhibits better or comparable performance across all domains, with the exception of the Shopping environment. The reason behind this exception is the inherent requirements for more extensive interaction with such websites for partially observable information, like dynamic product search results and product details. In comparison with SteP (Sodhi et al., 2024), which incorporates the external memory of domain-specific human-written workflows, SKILLWEAVER achieves better performance on CMS and Map environments, showing the promising quality of agent synthesized APIs even comparing with manually crafted workflows designed by human experts.

Live Website Results. As shown in Table 2, integrating synthesized APIs leads to an average relative improvement of 39.8% in success rate across four websites. For the Car website, while the final success rate remained unchanged after incorporating synthesized APIs, we observed that in four out of nine tasks, the synthesized APIs successfully guided the agent to the final state required for task completion. However, the agent still encountered failures during the final steps that demanded strong environment understanding and visual reasoning.

#### 4.2 Analysis

Generalization across Website. Generalization across diverse websites, particularly less common websites, remains a significant challenge. SKILLWEAVER presents a new angle to this challenge by integrating website-specific skills and knowledge through external memory in synthesized skill files. SKILLWEAVER is able to encapsulate skills and knowledge on website environments into code files containing accumulated skills.

To demonstrate the viability of such generalization, we don’t include any website specific in the agent and adapt the agent to different websites by purely integrating synthesized API libraries generated during pre-hoc website explorations. As shown in both Table 1 and Table 2, our agent is not only able to achieve stable performance improvements across all 5 WebArena websites but also in the 4 real-world live websites that are more complex and noisy.

Generalization across Agents. A critical feature of the skill repertoire is its ability to generalize across different web agents. Once the exploration process is completed, the synthesized API library can be reused to expand and enhance the action space of other agents capable of API calling. We conduct a comparative experiment by replacing the backbone language model with GPT-4o-mini without any other modification to the agent.

According to the results in Table 1, after switching the language model to GPT-4o-mini, the performance of the baseline agent is substantially weaker than other agents based on GPT-4o. However, upon integration with our synthesized APIs, the agent based on GPT4o-mini demonstrates remarkable relative success rate improvements ranging from 40% to 133% across five websites. Notably, this agent even achieves a better average success rate compared to the WebArena agent based on GPT-4o, particularly in the Map, Shopping, and

Reddit websites. These results highlight the transferability of our synthesized APIs as a plug-and-play module to enhance agents.

As the base agents become stronger, particularly those capable of more sophisticated inference-time search (e.g., Operator), the potential of SKILLWEAVER can be further unleashed. While current agents can accomplish challenging tasks through trial-anderror (Song et al., 2024a) and search over webpages Koh et al. (2024), certain complex skills remain beyond their capabilities. For example, as illustrated in Appendix D.2.3, the task request quote for multiple listings requires repeated, sequential, successful searches for specific vehicles, followed by separate quote requests. This process demands both long-range planning and back-tracing capabilities, which present significant challenges for existing agents. As agents grow stronger, SKILLWEAVER will enable the synthesis of increasingly sophisticated and complex skills.

Comparison with Human-Crafted APIs. We further conducted a comparison of the performance of agent with synthesized skills with the human-crafted APIs extracted from the official documentation and outsourcing websites (Song et al., 2024a). Based on the level of API support, websites are classified into three categories: low, medium, and high.

As shown in Figure 3, the performance of the synthesized APIs is comparable with human-crafted APIs on websites with low API support, such as Reddit, and those with medium API support, like Shopping. This result suggests that our exploration process is capable of generating APIs with quality that is comparable to or even superior to manually crafted APIs found in official documentation. On websites with high API support, such as GitLab and Maps, the performance of the synthesized APIs is not as good.

#### 4.3 Case Studies

Emergence of Compositional APIs. After a certain number of exploration iterations, we observe that the pipeline begins to generate compositional APIs that call multiple simpler APIs. An example is shown in § D.3. This API is responsible for applying multiple filters to search results that involves sequentially calling another API to close a webpage overlay, followed by two additional APIs to refine the search. This emergent behavior indicates an increasing level of abstraction and efficiency in SKILLWEAVER ’s ability to synthesize and integrate discovered skills.

Limitation in Skill Use. LLMs like GPT-4o are still not robust enough at API calling, and that hurts API-augmented agents like ours, even with human-crafted APIs. This challenge is even greater for weaker LLMs such as GPT-4o-mini, as illustrated in Table 1. We identify two primary categories of failures: (1) failure to identify the appropriate API and (2) generating wrong parameters. For example, SKILLWEAVER synthesized APIs to augment agents to search recipes in Cookpad.com. As demonstrated in Appendix D.2.4, the LLM is not able to identify the search recipes by cuisine type(’hamburger’) API to finish the task ”Save a hamburger recipe”. In Appendix D.2.5, the LLM successfully identifies the right API search recipes by ingredients(page, ’ingredients’) to complete the task ”Browse recipes for gluten-free chocolate chip cookies that can be made without nuts”. However, it generates the wrong keyword ’chocolate chip, -nuts’ instead of ’chocolate chip without nuts’, leading to empty search results.

### 5 Related Work

Web Agents. Automated web agents have recently emerged as a critical research direction with the vision of automating workflows in the internet. Substantial progress in web agents has been achieved by leveraging powerful LLMs alongside diverse prompting strategies to automate the prediction of web page actions (Zheng et al., 2024; Furuta et al., 2024; Zhou et al., 2024a; Yao et al., 2022). Given inputs like HTML content, accessibility trees, and screenshots, LLM-based approaches use in-context examples, skill usage, and the ReAct framework (Yao et al., 2023) to improve action prediction. These models can be further enhanced with action–coordinate pair data for better grounding (Cheng et al., 2024; Gou et al., 2024; You et al., 2024), learning from multiple web agent trajectories to improve multi-step reasoning and planning (Lai et al., 2024; Shaw et al., 2023; Deng et al., 2023), or training the agent to directly output pixel coordinates (Hong et al., 2024). Another line of work uses planning. Tree search agent (Koh et al., 2024) performs a best-first tree search using an LLM as a heuristic, and AgentQ (Putta et al., 2024) and WebPilot (Zhang et al., 2024) employ Monte Carlo Tree Search. The World-model-augmented web agent (Chae et al., 2024) and WebDreamer (Gu et al., 2024b) integrate LLM-based world models to anticipate the outcomes of its actions.

Tool Use and Synthesis. With the great potentials exhibited by tool-augmented LMs (Schick et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2024c), many works explore using LLMs to make tools across math reasoning (Cai et al., 2024; Qian et al., 2023; Yuan et al., 2024a), theorem proving (Wang et al., 2024a), structured data analysis (Lu et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2024d), and digital agent automation (Wang et al., 2023a; Gu et al., 2024a; Song et al., 2024b). However, existing methods rely on a set of existing training examples to determine tool correctness (Yuan et al., 2024a), or user input queries to bootstrap the tool-making system (Wang et al., 2024d). Our work does not necessitate annotated data and enables agents to gather experiences by self-exploring the environment while synthesizing more skills.

Self-Improvement. Many works explore collecting trajectories through experience, rating the success with a reward model, and using the results for policy training (Patel et al., 2024; Huang et al., 2023; Madaan et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023b; Singh et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2024; Yuan et al., 2024b). These approaches can be broadly categorized into parametric and non-parametric approaches. Parametric training with exploration trajectories has been investigated using various strategies, such as supervised fine-tuning (e.g., WebGUM (Furuta et al., 2024), Patel et al. (2024), and ScribeAgent (Shen et al., 2024)) and reinforcement learning–style optimization (e.g., ETO (Song et al., 2024a) and PAE (Zhou et al., 2024b)). Non-parametric methods typically transform exploration trajectories into reusable APIs or workflows that can be composed into more complex skills, like Voyager (Wang et al., 2023a) an LLM-based lifelong learning agent that continually explores the Minecraft environment. Friday (Wu et al., 2024) also investigates self-improvement on operating systems through exploration with pre-defined learning objectives. For web agents, the collected trajectories can be used as examples for in-context learning (Murty et al., 2024b), provide targets for fine-tuning (Furuta et al., 2024; Patel et al., 2024; Song et al., 2024a), and be distilled into text instructions to reproduce the desired behavior (workflows) (Wang et al., 2024e). Our work focuses on enabling web agents to continuously expand their skill repertoire by autonomously exploring website environments and distilling successful trajectories into reusable skills represented as Python APIs. These APIs are created to enable the agent to operate more efficiently during subsequent exploration and task execution.

### 6 Conclusion

Web agents aim to automate browsing tasks to enhance human productivity across diverse digital environments. A key challenge lies in adapting to real-world websites characterized by high diversity and complexity. Inspired by the self-improvement mechanism of humans, we propose SKILLWEAVER, a skill-centric framework that enables web agents to autonomously self-improve through exploration and API synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate substantial performance improvements, with relative success rate gains of 31.8% on WebArena benchmark and 39.8% on real-world websites. Notably, weaker agents

equipped with skills from more powerful counterparts showed improvements of up to 54.3%, demonstrating effective knowledge distillation through lightweight, transferable modules. Our findings point to a promising future where web agents can learn to improve themselves without parameter tuning by evolving a collective skill base.

### Ethics Statement

Generalist web agents hold the potential to automate routine web tasks, enhance user experiences, and promote web accessibility, safety concerns related to their real-world deployment are also critical. These concerns span privacy issues, such as access to users’ personal profiles, and sensitive operations, such as financial transactions or application form submissions. During online evaluation, we noticed the possibility of these web agents generating harmful actions on the web, and we manually validated the safety of all the actions before execution. Exploration on live website may lead to potential safety concerns about trigger harmful actions. In case the agent is being used on a live website, we add safety instructions which guardrail the agent away from actions that could potentially have side effects or that would otherwise be disadvantageous to explore, such as creating accounts or interacting with human users. It is critical for further research to thoroughly assess and mitigate the safety risks associated with web agents, ensuring they are safeguarded against producing and executing harmful actions. The code will also be released solely for research purposes, with the goal of making the web more accessible via language technologies under an OPEN-RAIL license. We are strongly against any potentially harmful use of the data or technology by any party.

### A Prompts

#### A.1 Skill Proposal

In case the agent is being used on a live website, we add safety instructions which bias the agent away from actions that could potentially have side effects or that would otherwise be disadvantageous to explore, such as creating accounts or interacting with human users.

Proposing Tasks to Explore

System: You propose tasks that would make good ’tools’ for external users of a website. User: You are a 'web agent ' who is learning how to use a website . You

write ” s k i l l s ” ( shortcuts ) for common website tasks , by proposing Python functions that would automate these tasks . You have already proposed the following s k i l l s : <proposed> {procedural knowledge} </proposed> You have built up the following knowledge about the website ( in

addition to the current screenshot ) :

<semantic knowledge> {semantic knowledge} </semantic knowledge>

Now please come up with something new to learn how to do on this website . The website is structured according to the following a c c e s s i b i l i t y

tree hierarchy :

<ax tree> { ax tree } </ax tree>

Do not interact with the Advanced Reporting tab i f you are using Magento . Do not interact with login/logout/user accounts on any s i t e .

I f you ' re on OpenStreetMap , don ' t interact with community features . Write a l i s t of useful s k i l l s /shortcuts that you would want to have

built into a website as Python functions . Write the name in natural language format . Do not use ”* id ” as a parameter in your s k i l l . Again , your goal is to generate functions that would be useful ” shortcuts ” for users of the website , so you should p r i o r i t i z e generating s k i l l s that compress a couple interactions into a single function c a l l . Additionally ,

being shortcuts , they should be for actions that a hypothetical user might r e a l i s t i c a l l y want to do . Then , estimate :

- (1) how useful they are (5 being d i f f i c u l t and frequency , 1 being t r i v i a l or uncommon) ,
- (2) the expected number of clicking/typing actions required to complete the s k i l l . ( calculate this by writing the l i s t of steps

and counting AFTERWARDS) Prefer to generate s k i l l s that are creating , modifying , or f i l t e r i n g /querying data on the website , as these tend to be more

useful . Do not generate s k i l l s simply to perform single clicks . { safety instructions }

Then , calculate the sum of these ratings for each s k i l l . Finally , select the s k i l l with the highest rating . Write your ratings in `step by step reasoning `. Then , write your s k i l l choice in `proposed skill `.

- A.2 Code Generation Agent Context Representation

- A.2.1 States as Accessibility Trees

We represent the state as a tuple containing an screenshot of the page, a title, a URL, and an accessibility tree hierarchy. These are serialized by concatenating clean string representations of each of these properties. We represent each node in the accessibility hierarchy as a line containing (1) indentation representing the depth in the tree, (2) the accessible role, (3) the accessible name of the element, in quotation marks, and finally (4) any other accessibility tree information (represented as aria- attributes in the DOM.)

- A.2.2 Prompts Substrings in square brackets ([]) are omitted if not applicable.

Code Agent Context Representation

- <state 0> URL: {relative url} { state accessibility tree string } </state>

<reasoning> {step by step reasoning} </reasoning> <code> {action source} </code> [<stdout> {stdout} </stdout>] [<result> {return value} </result>] [<warnings> {warnings} </warnings>] [<recovery> {recovered exception} </recovery>, ...] [<exception> {unrecoverable exception} </exception>]

- <state 1> URL: {relative url}

{ state accessibility tree string } </state>

...

<state N> URL: {relative url}

{ state accessibility tree string } </state> <terminate with result> {result} </terminate with result>

#### A.3 Code Generation Agent Error Detection

This is the prompt template used if we detect any errors in the agent’s code. We use the following error messages:

- 1. A function named act not provided: Function name must be ’act’
- 2. The function act does not contain a single argument, page: Function must take exactly one argument: ‘page‘.
- 3. The function function is disabled: Function ‘fnname‘ is disabled. Please use another function.
- 4. Incorrect or buggy Playwright functions: Please use the ‘page.get by ...().f()‘ functions instead of the ‘page.f(selector)‘ functions. where f ∈ {click, fill, type}.

- 5. Use of CSS selectors instead of accessibility tree selectors: Please use Accessibility Tree-centric selectors, like ‘page.get by role()‘, ‘.nth()‘, instead of the CSS-style selectors like ‘.locator()‘ or ‘.query selector()‘.

- 6. Blank response: You did not provide any Python code, but you also did not provide a result for ‘terminate with result‘. Please provide one or the other.

- 7. Type errors: Type Error: {error}

##### A.4 Action Synthesis Code Agent Action Generation You generate Playwright code to interact with websites. Words of wisdom:

- • If you want to click a generic button (e.g., that belongs to an element), use the full .get by role() path to the element (e.g., .get by role("group", name="Test Item").get by role("button", name="Go") instead of .get by role("button", name="Go"), as this is ambiguous).

- • Write exceptionally correct Python code.
- • You love to take advantage of functions in the knowledge base whenever possible. You use them via Python function calls. It is required to use the knowledge base function corresponding to an action if it exists.

- • Use relative goto when you can.

You are currently on a webpage titled {title repr}, with the URL {url repr}. Consider the following Accessibility Tree. The accessibility tree is formatted like this:

[role] ["name"] [properties] {{ [child1]

}}; [role] ["name"] [properties]; // no children

Here is an example:

<example> article "Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory Opens Its Gates" {{

link "Share";

}}; article "Hogwarts Begins Accepting Applicants for Class of 2029" {{

link "Share";

}}; </example>

To select the first link, you can do (because name = case-insensitive substring match unless exact=True is supplied):

first link = page.get by role(” article ”, name=”Willy Wonka”).get by role(”link”, name=” Share”)

Here is another example:

<example> article {{

header "How can I install CUDA on Ubuntu 22?"; link "Share";

}}; article {{

header "How do I install Docker?"; link "Share";

}}; </example>

To select the first link, you can do: page.get by role(” article ”). filter (has=page.get by role(”header”, ”How can I install

CUDA”)).get by role(”link”, name=”Share”)

Here, the .filter() is necessary to ensure that we select the correct article. This is especially important in cases where the parent element doesn’t include relevant criteria for identifying a child element. Tips about this tree:

- • If you see a node as a child of an iframe, you must use page.frame(name=...), and then access the node (via .get by role() or similar).

- • Some elements will require interaction via .select option(). They will be labeled as such. This is because they are HTML <select> elements, and thus cannot be interacted with via clicks.

You also have this library of Python functions available to you. Think carefully about whether you think these can be used in your code. If you conclude that you can use a function, then simply call it. These functions are all available as global variables.

<functions> {functions} </functions>

Additionally, you have collected the following knowledge about the website:

<semantic_knowledge> {semantic_knowledge} </semantic_knowledge>

Please think step by step and determine if further action needs to be taken. {step specific instructions} If further action needs to be taken, provide a code snippet to interact with the page. Use Playwright and complete the following Python function declaration:

async def act(page):

...

If you have no more actions to perform, leave the python code field blank and set the terminate with result field of your response to a non-empty string. Your previous actions are:

<previous_actions> {previous_actions} </previous_actions>

Here is the current website state:

<webpage_accessibility_tree> {ax_tree} </webpage_accessibility_tree>

Your previous actions have already executed. So your act() function should only represent NEW actions you want to take from here. IMPORTANT: DO NOT CHANGE LANGUAGE SETTINGS! Keep everything in English, even if you are in exploration mode.

Additionally, if you click a link that you expect will take you away from the current page, make that the last action in act(). Don’t write selectors that follow page navigations because you can’t predict what they will be.

Your task is {task}.

Make sure to continue from the current state of the UI—not necessarily the initial state. For example, if a dropdown is open, you do not need to open it again, and things like that. If it appears that the website is in a loading state, you may call await asyncio.sleep(5) to wait for the page to load.

{additional_instructions}

#### A.5 Success Checking

Responses to this were generated using Structured Outputs, as a dictionary with the keys step by step reasoning, a string, and success, a Boolean.

Success Verification

Please observe the following action log of someone using a computer. They were trying to do the following task: task. Given this log and the screenshot of their screen at the end of their attempt, please conclude whether they were successful. Trajectory: {trajectory string}

#### A.6 Persisting Attempt to Knowledge Base Persisting Attempt to Knowledge Base

You are learning how to use a website. In addition to maintaining a semantic base of knowledge, you are also building a procedural knowledge base. You should update your knowledge base with Python functions to automate what you are able to do successfully. These Python functions are written using the Playwright API. Write 'skills ', which are Python code snippets representing logical procedures to perform the task you just completed. Try to make this logical procedure represent the general case of your task, rather than a specific case. Make sure to carefully document the behavior of these skills , especially any behavior that you observe that is unexpected

and useful to know for future users. Any examples of what happened after you called the skill will be useful. If you got feedback on whether your results were successful

or unsuccessful, make sure to document this feedback as well, and any suggestions to improve performance.

You may be given either a single task attempt and success evaluation, or multiple task attempts and aggregate results. If a task attempt was successful, you may create a skill to simplify the task. If a task attempt uses a skill , but is ultimately unsuccessful, then you may want to improve the documentation for that skill's Python

function, to ensure that the skill can be used correctly in the future. If you used an existing function and the result was unexpected, make sure to update the documentation for that function to ensure that it can be used correctly in the future.

Unexpected results should be documented if they occur. You may also want to provide examples of successful usage too.

**Reasoning Template** − Make sure that you take a step back and think about the general procedure you used to

complete the task. − Make sure that you explicitly describe the changes that should be made to the function documentation.

**Overall Format** − You will be given either an empty knowledge base, or a knowledge base with existing

function declarations. − In your response, write declarations for new functions or update existing functions. − If you want to update an existing function, then you must have the function name of the

new implementation be an exact match − Do not write ”test ” or ”explore ” functions, nor functions that ”verify” that a previous skill was completed successfully.

**Function Declaration** − You should write a detailed docstring for the function (with triple quotes), describing

what it does and how to use it. − Make sure that any unexpected behavior is documented. − Make sure that the observed behavior and mechanics are carefully documented.

− Make sure your function begins with a `page.goto(”/...”)` call , which sets the initial

state of the page so that the function can be called correctly . Use a relative URL. − In your docstring, you must include a ”usage log” which describes the different times

you've used the function and what happened. − Use `page` as the first argument of your function. − Do not use `dict` as a type for any parameter. − Avoid using `* id` or `* url` parameters, because these are not human−readable. For

example: − `item name` is preferred over `item id` − `post url` is preferred over `post url` − Exception to this rule: If one of the input fields on the page requires you to input a

URL. − However, you should not do this if you are just going to `page.goto(item url)` in your code. − We will check your code for such parameters! − Make sure your code is correct, do not use any over complicated Python features (e.g. nested functions, and such). − Make sure your function is async because you use `await`. Your top level function should be the asynchronous one. Do not use any nested functions!!! − Do not use a global try−catch statement, if the only thing it does is print or reraise the error. Only catch exceptions that you can truly recover from. − Do not ``overfit” your function name to a specific set of task parameters. Instead, try to generalize your parameters.

**Selectors** − Note that by default, most string matching in the Playwright API is case−insensitive

and only searches for substring matches. If you want an exact match, you can pass the `exact=True` flag. − Do not overfit to selectors that include numbers in them (e.g. number of notifications, etc. should be replaced by a regex) In this case, put `import re` *inside* the method body.

For example, `page.get by role(name=”Hello”)` will match <div>Hello</div> and <div

>Hello world</div>.

As another example, `page.get by role(name=”See reviews (194)”)` will match <button>

See reviews (194)</button> but not <button>See reviews (12)</button>. If you instead do `page.get by role(name=re.compile(r”See reviews (\d+)”))`, it will

match both of them.

**Error Handling** − When you encounter exceptions, do not just ”print” the error − you should either recover

from the exception or reraise it .

**Misc** − Do not include actions to close cookie banners, because these will not be necessary

during future function calls .

If it appears that the task was not completed successfully, don't write a function. You don't want to assume what a good function will look like if you were unsuccessful.

#### A.7 Scraping Prompts

##### Determining Whether Scraping is Needed

The programmer is to write information seeking APIs for webpage. Please help evaluating whether we need information seeking APIs for the current webpage. For the webpage, I will provide:

- 1. Screenshot of the webpage interface
- 2. A summary of the page content and functionality Please analyze whether information seeking APIs should be implemented for this page.

Consider: − Whether the webpage is important for information seeking and the user's needs. − Whether user need to get data from the webpage. − Data retrieval needs.

Here are some examples of information seeking tasks: − get all orders in all pages − get all users − retrieve all products − obtain all reviews − get all repositories of user

The website content summary: {WEBSITE CONTENT SUMMARY} Response format: − If APIs are needed: Return 'Yes'. List each required API with its purpose. − If APIs are not needed: Return 'No'. Brief explanation why

##### Generating Scraping API

You are a professional website API programmer. I need you to create runnable Playwright−based APIs based on the following requirements :

I will give you a task description, and you will need to create a Playwright script that accomplishes the task.

The script should be written in PythonThe script should be asynchronous and should be written in a way that is easy to read and understand. The script should be runnable and should not contain any syntax errors.

Please just provide the code in a code block. Do not include any additional text or

comments. Task Description: {TASK DESCRIPTION}. Example of desired output format: ```python async def navigate to set status (page: Page):

await page.click ('[ data−qa−selector=”user menu”]') await page.click (' button:has−text(”Set status”) ')

###### ```

- 1. The input parameter for the API must include `page`, which is a Playwright `Page` object.

- 1. You are already on the correct page, do not need to navigate to another page.
- 2. Do not include the browser object.
- 3. Do not define the browser in the API code.

- 2. Please just provide the code in a code block. Do not include any additional text or comments. Do not include Usage. Just return the API code that should be inside the function.
- 3. Code: − Always explicitly handle async/await chaining. When calling async methods that

return objects with other async methods. Ensure each async operation in the chain is properly awaited. Use parentheses to clearly show the await order when chaining

− Common patterns to watch for: − WRONG: result = await obj.async method().another async method() − CORRECT: temp = await obj.async method() result = await temp.

another async method() OR: result = await (await obj.async method()). another async method()

− For browser automation libraries (like Playwright/Puppeteer): − Element selection methods (query selector, query selector all ) are async − Element properties/methods (inner text, text content, click ) are often async − Always await both the selector and the property access

- 4. If the task is about information seeking, please make sure the information is as comprehensive as possible.
- 5. Please review your generated code specifically checking for: − Missing await statements − Proper async method chaining − Correct handling of async property access
- 6. Code requirements:

- 1. Do not include ```await page.wait for selector(' selector ') ``` in the code. It always BUG.

- 2. Make sure the element selector is correct and precise.
- 3. If the page already contains information regarding the task, do not use page.goto() to navigate to the page.
- 4. If you need to navigate to a page, use page.goto() with the relative URL.
- 5. Please only return fixed API code. Do not include any other code like main().

- 7. HTML Content (truncated if too long): {HTML CONTENT}

##### Verifying Scraping Result

You are a verification system that checks if the code execution result matches the task requirements.

Task Description: {TASK DESCRIPTION}

Code Execution Result: {RESULT}

Please analyze whether the result matches the task requirements. Think about:

- 1. Does the result contain required information based on the task description?
- 2. Does the content make sense given the HTML context?

Compare the extracted data with the content visible in the HTML to ensure accuracy and completeness.

Answer ”is correct” if the result meets all requirements. If not, provide specific suggestions for improvement.

Current HTML Content (for reference): {HTML CONTENT}

##### Fixing Code for Incorrect Scraping Result

You are a Python debugging expert specializing in web automation with Playwright. Given the following code, error, and HTML context, analyze the issue and provide a fixed version.

## Instructions

- 1. Analyze the HTML structure to understand the page elements and locate what the task requires.
- 2. Identify the cause of the error in the code
- 3. Consider common Playwright issues like: − Selector timing issues
- 4. Provide a complete fixed version of the code
- 5. The HTML content provided is a truncated version of the webpage structure, because of constraints on the context window size.
- 6. The input parameter for the API must include `page`, which is a Playwright `Page` object.

- 1. Do not include the browser object.
- 2. Do not define the browser in the API code.

- 7. Do not need goto() method because the page already contains the necessary information.
- 8. Do not include ```await page.wait for selector(' selector ') ``` in the code. It always BUG.

Please return ONLY the fixed code without any explanation or markdown formatting

within the code block. The code should be a complete, runnable solution that includes all necessary imports. Please only return fixed API code. Do not include any other code like main().

## Task Description {TASK DESCRIPTION}

## Original Code

```python {CODE} ```

## Error Information ``` {ERROR INFO} ```

## Current Webpage HTML Structure ```html {HTML CONTENT} ```

- A.8 Skill Retrieval Retrieving Skills from Knowledge Base

You are provided a list of Python functions representing action shortcuts that can be

taken on a website (in addition to the basic actions like click , type, hover, select option , etc .) You identify which functions could be useful for completing a given task. You do this by breaking the task down into steps and seeing if any functions may be

useful.

You are given the following list of functions/shortcuts: <functions> {function space} </functions>

Your task is {repr task}. For each of the listed functions, please determine (explicitly ) whether they are useful

for the task. Then, provide a list of the function names that may be useful to the agent.

The agent is then prompted to generate a Structured Outputs dictionary with the keys step by step reasoning (string) and function names (list of strings). These functions are then injected into the prompt, formatted as the following:

Format for Functions Placed in Prompt

# Skill : {signature} {docstring}

Where signature is the Python code signature of the function (extracted by taking the substring of the function’s source up until the first close-parentheses), and docstring is the (un-indented) docstring from the function’s body, as parsed by Python’s ast module.

### D Example APIs

#### D.1 Success Cases

We find that APIs are able to successfully automate multiple atomic actions and represent them as a single action with richer input parameters. Here are some positive examples.

#### D.1.1 Correctly-Implemented Skills

Here is an skill that was implemented on the shopping website. It automatically performs the checkout process with the items currently in the cart.

express checkout

|async def express_checkout(page): """ Perform an express checkout for the items currently in the cart. Args:<br><br>page: The Playwright page object to perform actions on. Usage Log:<br><br>- Successfully completed express checkout , resulting in an order confirmation page with order number 000000191.<br><br>- Initial attempts failed due to a timeout error when clicking 'Proceed to Checkout '. Resolved by ensuring items were in the cart. Note:<br>- Ensure that the cart is pre -filled with the desired items before calling this function.<br><br>- The function assumes that the 'Proceed to Checkout' button is visible and clickable from the cart page.<br><br>- The function navigates through the checkout process by clicking 'Next' on the Shipping page and 'Place Order' on the Review & Payments page.<br><br>- If the 'Place Order' button is not immediately visible , a delay is included to allow dynamic elements to load. """ import asyncio<br><br><br>await page.goto("/") await page.get_by_role("link", name="My Cart").click() await asyncio.sleep(5) await page.get_by_role("button", name="Proceed to Checkout"). click() await asyncio.sleep(5) await page.get_by_role("button", name="Next").click() await asyncio.sleep(5) await page.get_by_role("button", name="Place Order").click() await asyncio.sleep(5)<br><br>|
|---|

Here is a skill that was learned for the shopping website that represents applying a discount code to the items in the cart.

express checkout

async def apply_discount_code(page, discount_code): """ Apply a discount code during the checkout process.

Args: page: The Playwright page object to perform actions on. discount_code (str): The discount code to apply.

Usage Log:

- - Attempted to apply 'DISCOUNT10', but it was invalid. Ensure valid discount codes are used.

Note:

[Figure 14]

[Figure 15]

Figure 4: Express Checkout API execution, before (left) and after (right).

- - The function navigates to the checkout page to ensure the correct initial state.

- - Handles invalid discount codes by checking for error messages or lack of discount application.

""" await page.goto("/checkout/#payment") await page.get_by_role("tabpanel", name="Apply Discount Code").get_by_role(

"textbox", name="Enter discount code" ).fill(discount_code) await page.get_by_role("tabpanel", name="Apply Discount Code").get_by_role(

"button", name="Apply Discount" ).click()

#### D.1.2 Debugging Process Fixing a Skill’s Implementation

Here, we demonstrate that the agent is capable of fixing DOM resolution errors, by making specific tweaks to problematic sections of code. After the following trajectory, the agent makes a patch to the knowledge base.

Error Encountered for delete merged branches

<state 0> URL: /byteblaze/accessible−html−content−patterns/−/merge requests/14 [Omitted] </state 0> <reasoning>

- 1. I need to delete merged branches in the specified project 'byteblaze/accessible−html− content−patterns'.
- 2. I can utilize the `delete merged branches` function which is predefined to handle this operation effectively in the GitLab UI.

[Figure 16]

[Figure 17]

- Figure 5: Apply Discount Code API execution. Before, the agent is on a random page (left), and after, the agent successfully navigates to the shopping cart and enters a discount code, WELCOME10 (right).

3. Since the page indicates that I am already within the correct project context, I can

proceed directly with invoking the function using the provided project path. </reasoning> <code>

|async def act(page): # Call the function to delete merged branches await delete_merged_branches(page , "byteblaze/accessible -html content -patterns")<br><br>|
|---|

</code> We found a bug in one of the APIs, and were able to make the following recoveries. For

each RECOVERY comment, follow the instructions.

<reasoning> The page currently displays a dialog that asks for confirmation to delete all merged

Here is the fix the agent made: removing the ambiguous DOM selector for “textbox”, and replacing it with one that first selects the dialog window that contains the textbox, and then the textbox element within it.

#### D.2 Failure Cases and Limitations

We observe some failure cases, which seem to be caused by gaps in LLM reasoning capabilities for certain situations.

#### D.2.1 Criteria for Verifying Success

Because our criteria for a function to be “verified” was to have it be called without producing an exception, we found that occasionally, malfunctioning APIs could be marked as verified simply because they silenced all exceptions that could have occurred. This represents a measure for evaluation having unintended consequences.

In the following example, a function was misused, and it was unable to resolve the necessary DOM elements given the page state. However, instead of improving the function’s signature or adding a check to ensure the function was called correctly, the LLM adds “if” statements to simply avoid any of the atomic actions from producing an error. While this does reduce the number of exceptions, it does not improve the robustness of the API.

[Figure 18]

- Figure 6: The agent is unable to successfully verify that the “add collaborator to project” works because it does not have access to a list of emails that can appropriately be used as test cases.

#### D.2.2 Creating Functional Test Cases

Some skills require interacting with data stored on the website, and their success is conditioned not on whether the UI is accurately interacted with but rather whether the function inputs are realistic. In the following example, the agent attempts to learn how to add collaborators to a Gitlab repository, but is unable to because it does not have a source of real test input data. Future work could explore automatically generating test cases for agents for successful evaluation in dynamic websites.

#### D.2.4 Fail to call API

The agent does not call available APIs even when they are generated during exploration. As shown in Figure 7, for the task ”Save a hamburger recipe,” the agent should first call search recipes by cuisine type(’hamburger’) to obtain recipe details and then select the print option to save the recipes. However, the agent fails to call this API during the task execution, indicating a gap between exploration and execution phases, suggesting the need for improving the agent’s policy to better utilize generated APIs.

search recipes by cuisine type

IGNORECASE)) if await search_button.is_visible():

await search_button.click() else:

await page.keyboard.press("Enter")

#### D.2.5 Wrong Parameter

In some cases, the agent correctly identifies the appropriate API but selects incorrect parameters. For example in Figure 8, in the task ”Browse recipes for gluten-free chocolate chip cookies that can be made without nuts,” the agent incorrectly uses the parameter search recipes by ingredients(page, ’chocolate chip, -nuts’), whereas the correct parameter should be search recipes by ingredients(page, ’chocolate chip without nuts’). This indicates that the agent needs better parameter selection logic to enhance performance.
