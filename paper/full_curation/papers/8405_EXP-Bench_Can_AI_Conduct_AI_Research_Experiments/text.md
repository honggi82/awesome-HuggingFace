## Abstract

Automating AI research holds immense potential for accelerating scientific progress, yet current AI agents struggle with the complexities of rigorous, endto-end experimentation. We introduce EXP-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to systematically evaluate AI agents on complete research experiments sourced from influential AI publications. Given a research question and incomplete starter code, EXP-Bench challenges AI agents to formulate hypotheses, design and implement experimental procedures, execute them, and analyze results. To enable the creation of such intricate and authentic tasks with high-fidelity, we design semi-autonomous pipeline to extract and structure crucial experimental details from these research papers and their associated open-source code. With the pipeline, EXP-Bench curated 461 AI research tasks from 51 top-tier AI research papers. Evaluations of leading AI agents, such as OpenHands [87] and IterativeAgent [76] on EXP-Bench demonstrate partial capabilities: while scores on individual experimental aspects such as design or implementation correctness reach 20-35%, the success rate for complete, executable experiments was a mere 0.5%. By identifying these bottlenecks and providing realistic step-by-step experiment procedures, EXPBench serves as a vital tool for future AI agents to improve their ability to conduct AI research experiments. EXP-Bench is open-sourced at https://github.com/ Just-Curieous/Curie/tree/main/benchmark/exp_bench.

Figure 1: EXP-Bench evaluates AI agents on research experiment tasks extracted semi-autonomously from peer-reviewed AI papers. Given a research question, a high-level method description, and starter code, agents are tasked with designing, implementing, and executing complete experiments. Performance is validated through ground-truth comparisons and implementation execution.

Automating AI research stands as a cornerstone for accelerating the development of advanced intelligence and human progress. Unlike disciplines that require extensive physical interaction, AI research is inherently digital, rendering it particularly amenable to automation by Large Language

Model (LLM)-driven AI agents. Recent work has demonstrated that these agents demonstrate nascent capabilities in tasks like literature synthesis [23], hypothesis generation [91] and code generation [53]. However, empirical AI research requires rigorous end-to-end experimentation, which goes beyond these individual tasks.

To realize the vision of agents conducting holistic AI research, a rigorous benchmark is needed—one that evaluates and guides agents through the full experimentation pipeline step by step. We present EXP-Bench, a benchmark designed to comprehensively assess an AI agent’s ability to carry out end-to-end research experiments. As illustrated in Fig. 1, EXP-Bench challenges agents with tasks sourced from influential, peer-reviewed AI publications (e.g., NeurIPS, ICLR) along with their open-source implementations. These papers reflect already-completed, peer-validated research and serve as concrete exemplars of full experimental workflows. By exposing agents to such tasks, we test their ability to conduct established scientific procedures grounded in real-world AI experimentation. For each task, an agent is provided with a core research question, a high-level methodological overview, and starter code. The agent should then formulate viable hypotheses, design AI-specific experimental procedures (e.g., data handling, model selection, and hyperparameter optimization), correctly implement and execute these experiments, and derive valid conclusions from the results.

However, curating these high-fidelity and structured experimental tasks presents considerable challenges. Academic papers typically present a polished narrative focusing on final results and conclusions, often omitting the detailed intermediate steps of the experimentation process. Additionally, critical details—such as the precise conditions under which results hold or subtle data preprocessing steps—are often fragmented across multiple sources, including dense academic papers, supplementary materials, and sprawling codebases. This necessitates deep domain expertise for accurate interpretation and makes manual curation of such tasks labor-intensive and difficult to scale.

To address these challenges, we develop a semi-automated dataset curation pipeline. We first filter for high-quality AI papers with open-source codebases using citation and repository popularity signals. Task extraction then proceeds in two stages: (1) a multi-modal extraction phase that identifies the core elements of the research problem—such as the main question, expected outcomes, and high-level experimental setup (e.g., datasets, evaluation metrics, model configurations)—from papers, supplementary materials, and code; and (2) an implementation extraction phase that locates relevant code and assembles scripts to solve the specified task. We further apply execution-based validation to ensure functionality. While human oversight is used, the availability of original implementations and ground truths reduces the validation burden to mostly lightweight consistency checks. With the pipeline, EXP-Bench currently comprises 461 research tasks (12,737 individually gradable subtasks) derived from 51 papers published at NeurIPS and ICLR 2024, spanning diverse AI subfields such as reinforcement learning, AI applications and generative models.

We use a multi-metric evaluation pipeline (Fig. 1) to assess agent performance across all core phases of experimentation—design, implementation, execution, and conclusion. Each metric captures a distinct capability, and their conjunctive use ensures that agents correctly understand and complete the experiment. Initial evaluations of leading agents reveal that, while they often succeed at executing routine procedures—such as running pre-written scripts or replicating documented analysis steps—they struggle when tasked with conducting complex experiments. Specifically, we observe failures in: (a) Conceptualizing and operationalizing sound experimental designs from high-level research questions and methods (16.1% misclassified design variables); (b) Translating abstract research methodologies into complete and correct code implementations (39.7% missing essential implementation components); and (c) Ensuring the robust and reproducible execution of complex experimental software stacks (29.4% environment or dependency misconfigurations or 23.8% scriptlevel errors). By identifying these key bottlenecks, EXP-Bench helps us target specific research components for improvement and advance next-generation AI agents for autonomous research.

## 2 Related work

While existing benchmarks have advanced the evaluation of AI agents in various scientific reasoning, coding, and specific machine learning tasks, EXP-Bench distinctively addresses the holistic challenge of end-to-end and step-by-step AI research experimentation. See App. A for additional discussion.

Scientific Reasoning Benchmarks. Benchmarks like BoxingGym [27] explore simulated theory formation, while others such as AAAR [60] and Lab-Bench [49] assess reasoning or experimental

design based on static artifacts (e.g., protocols, figures). While valuable for assessing abstract reasoning, these benchmarks do not evaluate the agent’s ability to perform actual experiments.

Scientific Coding Benchmarks. Scicode [81], for instance, focuses on generating code snippets for natural science tasks, while BLADE [31], DiscoveryBench [64], and ScienceAgentBench [14] primarily assess post-hoc data analysis or hypothesis testing. While critical to the scientific process, they often isolate coding or analysis from the broader, iterative experimental context.

Machine Learning Benchmarks. Several benchmarks specifically target machine learning (ML) tasks, yet often focus on sub-components or operate with simplifications of the full research cycle. For example, DSBench [45], ML-Agent-Bench [39], and MLE-Bench [12] assess ML problemsolving capabilities, such as script editing or hyperparameter tuning, frequently within constrained environments like Kaggle challenges. Other benchmarks such as RE-Bench [92], ML-Gym [69], and Curie [47], compare agent performance against humans on research tasks, but often operate at a limited scale (e.g., RE-Bench features only 7 hand-curated tasks) or use simplified evaluation metrics. PaperBench [76] assesses agents on tasks derived from academic literature, focusing on their proficiency in executing specific, well-defined sub-components of the research process, such as running documented code scripts or performing standard data analyses. While these benchmarks provide valuable insights into specific ML tasks, they generally fail to capture the complexity of realistic end-to-end AI research workflows, nor do they typically offer a methodology for constructing such comprehensive benchmark tasks at scale.

## 3 The EXP-Bench Benchmark and Dataset

EXP-Bench is built to evaluate the AI agent’s ability to address AI research tasks by conducting end-to-end experimentation. Each research task is grounded on an influential AI research paper and its corresponding codebase. This coupling captures the full scientific workflows—linking concrete high-level ideas to executable implementations (§3.1). We achieve scalable construction of these highfidelity tasks through a semi-automated curation pipeline, which integrates multi-modal extraction with lightweight human verification (§3.2). This design also opens the door to large-scale data generation for training agents capable of automating core aspects of AI research.

### 3.1 EXP-Bench Dataset Specification

Our dataset is a collection of AI research tasks, each structured to emulate a complete experimental process designed to address a specific AI research question from a published paper. As shown in Fig. 2, each task entry in the dataset contains a problem statement for the agent, and the corresponding ground-truth solution derived from the original research artifacts.

Problem Statement (Agent Input). Each task instance within EXP-Bench provides the agent with: (1) Research Question: A specific goal derived from the source paper’s experiments. (2) High-Level Method: A description guiding the required experimental approach; and (3) Code Repository: Access to the relevant code, potentially with specific components/scripts masked or requiring modification.

Figure 3: EXP-Bench’s dataset comprises tasks from a diverse set of ML research categories.

Expected Outcome (Ground Truth). Each task instance also includes a ground-truth experimental solution curated from the source paper and codebase. This solution—used to evaluate agent outputs—comprises: (1) an experimental design specifying key variables, constants, and procedures; (2) the necessary code modifications, assessed via a git diff against the provided repository; and (3) a final conclusion that directly answers the research question based on experimental results.

Benchmark Overview and Statistics: EXP-Bench currently includes 461 research tasks drawn from 51 influential papers, as detailed in App. B. As shown in Fig. 3, these tasks span diverse AI subfields—including Computer Vision, NLP, and Reinforcement Learning—and are sourced from top-tier venues, namely NeurIPS 2024 (53%) and ICLR 2024 (47%). This breadth ensures coverage of diverse experimental paradigms, coding practices, and research challenges prevalent in the AI field. Moreover, each task is broken down into fine-grained, individually gradable subtasks spanning all three ground-truth components—design, implementation, and conclusion—resulting in a total of 12,737 subtasks. Together, these features make EXP-Bench a comprehensive testbed for assessing the capabilities of AI research agents.

### 3.2 EXP-Bench Semi-Automated Dataset Construction Pipeline

Curating a high-fidelity benchmark for end-to-end AI experimentation is challenging due to the fragmented and domain-specific nature of real-world research artifacts—namely papers and their associated codebases. Critical experimental details are often scattered, implicit, or embedded in dense technical language, making manual extraction labor-intensive and difficult to scale. To address this, we propose a semi-automated construction pipeline that systematically structures these artifacts into benchmark tasks with lightweight human oversight. The pipeline comprises three stages (Fig. 4):

- Stage 1: Source Selection and Filtering. The process begins by identifying candidate research artifacts that form the basis of high-quality experimental tasks. We target influential papers from top-tier AI conferences (e.g., NeurIPS, ICLR) that are accompanied by publicly available code repositories. Initial filtering criteria are applied to prioritize impactful and potentially reproducible research, considering factors such as citation counts, and code repository activity (e.g., GitHub stars, forks). This selection phase aims to establish a strong foundation by focusing on artifacts that, despite potential imperfections, represent significant and verifiable research contributions.
- Stage 2: Experiment Procedure Extraction. Research papers rarely present experiments as complete procedures—key steps are often implicit or scattered. To enable structured agent evaluation, we decompose each task into explicit sub-steps. This transforms high-level research goals into concrete workflows—e.g., multi-step experiment design and environment setup—making them suitable for both execution and fine-grained evaluation. This stage extracts the complete research task by combining the research plan (from the paper) with its corresponding experiment implementation (from the codebase). Further implementation details can be found in App. F.

- Stage 2.1: Extract Research Task. We begin by extracting the core research task—consisting of the research question, high-level methodology, and expected outcome—directly from the paper. This

[Figure 61]

process is designed to handle the fact that key information in academic papers is often distributed across sections and conveyed implicitly. First, we index the PDF using a combination of OCR (Optical Character Recognition) and multimodal extraction techniques to capture structured elements like tables, figures, and headers. This ensures downstream access to high-signal artifacts that may anchor the task definition. Next, we conduct a multi-pass extraction. In the first pass, we perform retrieval-augmented querying to identify broad, high-level research takeaways. These overarching questions are often not confined to a single paragraph and require stitching together dispersed cues. In the second pass, for each high-level takeaway, we apply semantic extraction at the subsection level, focusing on evaluation sections. We classify each subsection as either implementation context or a candidate research question. Contextual passages are stored and reused across subsequent prompts. This focused prompting—processing each subsection independently while conditioning on accumulated context and extracted tables/figures—helps the LLM generate more accurate and detailed task formulations. Finally, we refine each task through targeted re-querying of the full paper (including appendices) to recover any additional setup constraints or methodological details that were missed earlier. This step acknowledges that relevant setup details may be located far from the task description and ensures completeness for the extracted task.

- Stage 2.2: Extract Experiment Implementation. Each extracted task is then passed to an implementation extraction AI agent (operating in a tool-augmented environment—with PDF reading, terminal access, and web browsing) to identify the specific implementation (chain of scripts) needed to address the research task. Our setting provides the agent with both a complete codebase and the extracted task—containing the research question, methodology, and expected outcome. This effectively reduces the problem to a goal-conditioned search over the codebase, where the agent’s task is to localise the implementation that realises the specified methodology and expected outcome. To do this, the agent explores the repository in an open-ended fashion—e.g., consulting documentation, and auxiliary scripts, to uncover domain-specific requirements (e.g., pretrained checkpoints). The extracted experiment execution ground truth will be fully based on existing scripts. The agent outputs

(1) a list of required scripts and (2) high-level usage instructions describing how to run them to complete the task. Once a candidate implementation is produced, it is executed in Stage 3. If the run fails, the pipeline iterates—allowing the agent to refine or replace the implementation until a working solution is found. The final validated script chain is then parsed by the agent via AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) tracing to extract a step-by-step list of implementation requirements in natural language, which becomes the ground truth for evaluating implementation correctness. Finally, we incorporate additional contextual details (e.g., hyperparameters) sourced from the raw code (e.g., configuration files) or repository documents (e.g., README.md) to enhance the final task specification.

- Stage 3: Verification and Refinement. All tasks are validated and finalized in this stage. For paper-derived tasks with corresponding implementations, the associated scripts are executed in a clean, containerized environment. Execution traces are then checked against expected outputs from the original paper. If validation fails, the task is returned to the previous stage for refinement. For tasks lacking a matched implementation, we perform manual validation to ensure the extracted

research objective faithfully aligns with the source paper. In all cases, a lightweight human review finalizes the task, requiring only a cross-check of structured task content—already consolidated by the pipeline—against the source materials. This significantly reduces human burden compared to manual curation from scratch. Following validation, each complete task is added to the dataset along with a list of masked files (e.g., README.md, relevant scripts) to ensure agents cannot directly access answers. In our benchmark implementation, repositories are cloned afresh per agent, and masking is applied using scripted git operations, including recursive traversal of submodules. Masking ensures agents must reason over the task input, rather than rely on shortcut access to original solutions.

## 4 Evaluation

### 4.1 Evaluating LLM-based Agents Performance on EXP-Bench: Setup & Main Results

Setup. We evaluate a range of agents and LLMs used in related benchmarks [13] against EXPBench. In terms of agents, we made use of OpenHands (a top-performing code generation agent) and IterativeAgent (as configured in [76] to reduce the likelihood of early task stopping), henceforth known as OH and IA, respectively. In terms of LLMs, these include the top-ranked Claude-Sonnet 3.7, Haiku 3.5, Deepseek-R1 [90] models, and OpenAI o3-mini variants. Each agent is run in an Ubuntu 24.04 Docker container, and given access to 4 × Nvidia A40 GPU, and a clean working directory containing the masked GitHub repo of the paper (i.e., task-specific scripts removed), instructions, and relevant context (e.g., API credentials).

Evaluation Judge Implementation Details. Our evaluation framework consists of two main components used to assess agent performance across various metrics (refer to later sections, e.g., Table 1). The first component is an LLM-based judge (using o3-mini), following prior work on LLM-as-a-judge [111, 56, 1, 76]. This judge operates through multiple steps: The process begins with an integrity check performed by a Monitor, which analyzes agent logs to detect disallowed behaviors (denoted as metric M; see Fig. 6b). Specifically, the monitor checks whether the agent: (1) accessed the research paper directly (e.g., opened the PDF), (2) performed Git operations such as checking out commits or switching branches, or (3) used fake, hardcoded, or placeholder data rather than generating results through real experimentation. If violations are found, the monitor also identifies possible causes (e.g., ethical refusals, runtime errors) using log information. Once integrity is established, the agent’s experimental design, implementation, and conclusion are evaluated for conceptual soundness, completeness (e.g., inclusion of all required steps), and alignment with ground truth. These assessments yield scores for: D (design correctness, i.e., proportion of design criteria met), I (implementation correctness, i.e., proportion of implementation components satisfied), and C (conclusion correctness). The second component of our evaluation judge is a Code Execution Validator, which runs the agent-generated code modifications in a clean and equivalent containerized environment. This step verifies whether the code is executable and produces expected outputs. This executability metric is denoted as E. Implementation details including the system prompt are in App. H.

Main Results. Table 1 presents average accuracy scores across all 461 tasks. I·E indicates whether an implementation is both appropriate for the experimental task and executable—a more comprehensive check of implementation quality. All✓ denotes tasks that are fully correct in terms of D, I, and C, while All·E✓ adds the executability requirement. #E represents the number of tasks per model that were execution-checked. Due to the time-consuming nature of execution, only a subset of traces were

evaluated—excluding those that failed the monitor check, which were automatically discarded prior to execution. Our top-ranked agents are OH+o3-mini, OH+3.7 Sonnet, and OH+Nova Pro, ranked via All·E✓, with C used as a tiebreaker. The worst-performing model was IA+Nova Pro. Extended results by paper category are shown in Table 3, with full details in App. D. Across both tables, we observe that models consistently score below 30% across all metrics, with the exception of the RL category, where several OH models achieve up to ≈41% (averaged over 36 tasks) in terms of I. Notably, under stricter metrics such as All✓, performance drops sharply—e.g., OH+o3-mini scores only 1.4%. This underscores the value of including partial metrics that assess individual aspects, allowing credit for partially correct answers and supporting a more nuanced evaluation.

### 4.2 Detailed Analysis

Cost-Time Analysis. Fig. 6a shows the average cost (in USD) and time (in minutes) per task across different agent configurations. Cost reflects only the token usage of the backbone LLM (input/output), excluding agent internal LLM-API usage or compute consumption. The number in parentheses next to each legend entry indicates the model’s performance rank, based on average correctness. Each agent was allowed a maximum of 40 minutes per task, though this limit can be easily adjusted. Notably, IA models often consumed the full allotted time, rarely stopping early. In contrast, early stopping was common with OH models. For example, the relative time difference between Nova and Haiku is larger under OH than IA, reflecting differing usage patterns. These trends are consistent with our earlier observations: OH models often produced plausible responses without actually running the experiment, leading to high partial scores (e.g., design, implementation), while IA models tended to run longer but less effectively. Interestingly, we found little correlation between runtime/cost and overall performance. OH+o3-mini (rank 1) achieves the best trade-off with low cost and moderate time. OH+3.7 Sonnet (rank 2) performs well but is the slowest and most expensive. The full cost–time distribution is provided in App. I.2.

Conjunctive Evaluation Metrics Substantially Lower Agent Scores. We analyze only the subset of tasks for which execution was run, to visualize how progressively applying stricter evaluation criteria impacts agent scores. As shown in Fig. 6b (with full results in App. I.1), applying only the initial monitoring check (M) yields an average score of 20.6%. Adding design (D) and conclusion (C) correctness criteria reduces the score sharply to 3.7%. Incorporating implementation correctness (I) further lowers the score to 0.4%, and including execution verification (E) results in a final accuracy of just 0.2%. These findings highlight how conjunctive evaluation surfaces brittleness in end-to-end experimental correctness.

Metric Stability Analysis. As shown in Fig. 5, certain individual metrics such as C and E exhibit high variance. This variance arises for different reasons: for C, agents can produce plausible but unfounded conclusions without a valid experimental foundation; for E, even incorrect or mock implementations may successfully execute, introducing overestimation bias. To mitigate such inconsistencies, we adopt compositional scoring via conjunctive metrics such as C·D and I·E, which combine correctness across multiple dimensions. These conjunctive forms substantially reduce score variability, producing more reliable signals of agent performance. For example, C·D filters out conclusions not grounded in valid design plans, and I·E discounts executions that do not fulfill setup requirements. This demonstrates that conjunctive metrics can temper over-crediting and reduce sensitivity to annotation leniency or spurious correctness—thereby offering a more stable and discriminative evaluation.

domain-specific insights from these earlier error analyses, across phases for all agent-task pairs. In the second pass, we iteratively grouped these insights into distinct failure types—assigning each to an existing category or creating a new one if needed. This process produced 3,238 raw insights, which we distilled into 361 unique failure types. We present a representative and simplified subset of these condensed errors in Table 2 (full details can be found in App. G).

Analysis. To better understand where agents fail, we analyzed error traces and categorized them into representative failure types across four key phases of experimentation: implementation, execution, design, and conclusion. As shown in Table 2, the most prevalent issues emerged during the implementation phase, with 39.71% of failures stemming from missing essential components. In several cases, agents failed to include critical elements such as semantic retrieval strategies (e.g., UniXcoder-H2L and UniXcoder-L2H), validation functions for filtering questions (e.g., using GPT3.5), or robustness-enhancing techniques like Mixup, CutMix, and Label Smoothing—undermining the experimental implementation’s validity. Incomplete data preprocessing (1.83%) was another notable implementation issue, with agents omitting required dataset loading and transformation steps, such as ETTh1 series preparation, ACF plotting, or normalization procedures (e.g., RevIN), instead providing only boilerplate config files. In the execution phase, failures were most commonly due to environment or dependency misconfigurations (29.38%), such as missing critical environments (e.g., STORM not registered in jaxmarl) or absent core libraries like PyTorch and Flax, which led to model loading failures. Script-level issues (23.84%) included unrecognized model names (e.g., moganet_tiny not found in timm) and missing checkpoint files, causing runtime or I/O errors. These examples highlight persistent reproducibility challenges even when a correct implementation structure is in place. Design-related failures were also frequent, with 16.05% involving incomplete or misclassified experimental variables, and 7.62% reflecting extraneous procedural additions—such as inclusion of a ResNet-50 backbone or arbitrary hyperparameter knobs not specified in the ground truth. These design errors suggest that agents often fail to distinguish between essential experimental factors and implementation noise. Finally, conclusion-phase errors highlight limitations in agents’ interpretive reasoning. The most common issue (26.18%) was missing or underdeveloped conclusions—for instance, omitting detailed comparisons between PPO and Q-Learning on training time and normalized scores, or neglecting specific numerical gains (e.g., 1.25% improvements across ARC-Challenge and OpenBookQA). Another frequent error (19.66%) was incorrect interpretation, such as claiming Hadamard-enhanced INT4 inference improves performance without substantiating comparisons to baseline INT4. Together, these findings emphasize the importance of phase-specific evaluation and illustrate how surface-level plausibility can mask deeper breakdowns in experimental reasoning and reproducibility.

## 5 Discussion

Limitations. EXP-Bench primarily focuses on the experimentation procedure – from designing experiments for a given research question to deriving conclusions. The broader AI research lifecycle encompasses other critical stages such as identifying gaps through literature review, the initial unstructured ideation of research questions, and navigating the complex, iterative, and unpredictable path of real-world scientific discovery, which are not yet fully captured by the current task structures.

Future directions. Future work will focus on enhancing AI agents’ ability to automate research experimentation using supervision from EXP-Bench’s dataset. One promising direction is to apply reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards, enabling agents to autonomously navigate the research lifecycle and accelerate scientific discovery.

## 6 Conclusion

We introduced EXP-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate and guide the development of AI agents in conducting end-to-end AI research experimentation. By sourcing tasks from influential peer-reviewed publications and their accompanying codebases, and utilizing a semi-automated curation pipeline, EXP-Bench presents agents with realistic, fine-grained challenges in end-to-end AI research workflow including experimental design, implementation, execution, and conclusion derivation. Our initial evaluations with leading agents reveal significant bottlenecks in conceptualizing complex experiments and ensuring robust code implementation and execution. EXP-Bench therefore serves not only as a comprehensive evaluation tool but also as a valuable dataset to guide future AI agents to act step by step, ultimately accelerating AI research.

## A Extended Related Works

LLMs for scientific discovery. Many methods have adopted LLMs to generate novel hypotheses for common scientific discovery. For example, Baek et al. [4], Wang et al. [84], and Yang et al. [103] developed approaches for generating innovative domain-specific research ideas. Going beyond domain-specific ideas, a line of work also focuses on generate hypothesis with LLMs in the commonsense domains [28, 67, 102, 91, 65, 89, 2, 98, 34, 97]. Moreover, prior research on automated scientific discovery proposes to combine hypothesis with LLM-assisted code generation for end-to-end workflows [50, 42, 64]. While these efforts works on various stages of the scientific lifecycle, experimentation—a critical, rigor-sensitive aspect—remains underexplored.

Some existing research explores building an automated scientific discovery workflow with rigorous validation using AI agents [61, 91, 46, 106, 75, 9, 79, 105, 29], they often either have limited automated evaluation or rely on domain-specific ad-hoc prompting optimizations to guide predefined workflows, struggling with the complexities of rigorous end-to-end experimentation to automate AI research. Particularly, Lu et al. [61] introduced a fully automated system called "The AI Scientist" to conduct research by collaborating with multiple LLM agents. These agents handle the full research process, from defining research problems and reviewing related literature to synthesizing and executing experiments. However, their solution has limited automated evaluation with a focus on commonsense domains. Gottweis et al. [91] proposed an AI Co-scientist built on Gemini 2.0, aiming at building a helpful AI collaborator for scientists. They focus on the scaling of the testtime compute paradigm to generate high-quality hypotheses and research proposals. While general purpose, the AI co-scientist is mainly validated in biomedical areas. Overall, these efforts often require experimental validation to follow constrained, framework-specific formats, resulting in extra overhead and hindering their usability.

Benchmarks for domain-specific AI agent tasks. A wide range of benchmarks have been developed to evaluate the capabilities of AI agents across diverse domains. Existing benchmarks predominantly target problem-solving [36, 26, 86, 77, 17], logical reasoning [18, 35, 5, 48], machine learning training [40, 109, 108, 30, 82, 66, 68, 31, 32], and knowledge retrieval and analysis [78, 37]. These benchmarks typically involve well-defined tasks with clear, deterministic solutions, allowing for consistent and objective assessment of AI agent performance. By contrast, our proposed EXP-Bench focuses on experimentation for automating AI research, which requires a more rigorous and systematic approach beyond problem-solving. Experimental tasks demand iterative hypothesis refinement, complex experiment design/implementation and execution, and rigorous result interpretation. Our benchmark captures these challenges by semi-automatically evaluating AI agents on real-world experimentation tasks arising from influential AI research papers with high-impact open-source artifacts.

## C Societal Impact

The advancement of AI agents capable of conducting AI research, as facilitated by benchmarks like EXP-Bench, offers positive societal impacts. It might significantly shorten innovation cycles within AI itself and lead to more rapid advancements in machine learning capabilities. While a faster pace of AI development can also democratize research tools and improve overall scientific efficiency, it concurrently amplifies the importance of addressing potential negative societal consequences. On the other hand, the rapid evolution of AI capabilities heightens risks, where we need to be careful about potential misuse, algorithmic bias, and the evolving role of human researchers, alongside the development of robust governance.

## E Extended EXP-Bench Examples

This section presents two extended examples from EXP-Bench: a question concerning robust detection in collaborative perception under imperfect localization, and a question focused on implementing a Time Delay Neural Network (TDNN) for automatic speech recognition. Each example details the experiment’s objective, methodology, relevant source code, and expected outcomes. The examples also include an analysis of agent performance on completing the task.

### E.1 Example 1: Robust Detection in Collaborative Perception

This example question was extended from the paper An Extensible Framework for Open Heterogeneous Collaborative Perception [62].

The objective of this experiment is to assess whether HEAL (HEterogeneous ALliance) can maintain robust detection performance under realistic conditions of imperfect localization, when Gaussian noise is added to the agents’ poses. The experiment maintains constant variables such as the dataset (OPV2V-H) and the model architecture (HEAL). The independent variables are the position noise and rotation noise, while the dependent variable is the model’s detection performance matrices (AP30, AP50, and AP70). Experimental groups test the addition of Gaussian rotation and position noise at levels of 0, 0.2, 0.4, and 0.6 meters/degrees to accurate poses. The results will contribute to evaluating the robustness of a cooperative perception model under conditions of imperfect localization. EXP-Bench extends this task from the original paper section 5.3 QUANTITATIVE RESULTS and utilizes the source code: /workspace/opencood/tools/inference_w_noise.py from the GitHub repository https://github.com/yifanlu0227/HEAL. Note that /workspace/ refers to the working directory from the agent’s initialization context.

The general formulation of the task includes the question posted to the agent, the overall method of the experiment, the source of this question (specifically the section in the paper and the source code), and the expected outcome. This is illustrated in Fig. 7a.

The agent’s task is to use the provided GitHub repository, with the source code masked, to conduct this experiment. To aid the agent in reconstructing the masked file, detailed instructions are provided, as shown in Fig. 7b.

Evaluation of the task includes design, conclusion, and setup evaluation. The conclusion appears in the ‘expected outcome’ in Fig. 7a. Design and setup evaluation are based on ‘design complexity’ and ‘requirements’ respectively, shown in Fig 8.

An example agent output using the bedrock-us-anthropic-claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1-0 LLM as a backbone is showcased here. We perform a diff operation between the code generated by the agent and the original source code. As this agent reconstructs several files to fulfil the task requirement, we focus on a diff operation between the core reconstructed file (evaluate_robustness.py) and the source file (inference_w_noise.py), shown in Fig. 9. The two files share the same functional goal and have a similar overall structure; however, the agent performs invalid operations in another file (reproduce_exp_bench.sh), leading to a failure in completing the task. The detailed reasoning provided by the judge is illustrated in Fig. 10.

### E.2 Example 2: Time Delay Neural Network for ASR

This example is extended from the paper Zipformer: A Faster and Better Encoder for Automatic Speech Recognition [104].

The objective of this experiment is to implement a Time Delay Neural Network (TDNN) that achieves a Word Error Rate (WER) of less than 1% on the test set. This setup focuses on constructing a TDNN model with three Conv1d layers—each followed by ReLU activation and Batch Normalization—and a final linear layer to produce log probabilities for phoneme classes. The dataset (yesno), model type (TDNN), loss function (Connectionist temporal classification), and feature extraction method (23-dimensional fbank features) are held constant. Independent variables include the model architecture, training hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, weight decay), and number of epochs, while the dependent variable is the WER obtained during evaluation. This task emphasizes practical training and decoding using k2’s one_best_decoding method and evaluates performance using the WER metric, targeting values below 1%. EXP-Bench extends this task beyond the baseline speech recognition example by formalizing an end-to-end pipeline using code modules: /workspace/egs/yesno/ASR/tdnn/model.py, train.py, decode.py, and asr_datamodule.py from the Github repository https://github.com/k2-fsa/icefall.

The general formulation of the task includes the question posted to the agent, the overall method of the experiment, the source of this question (specifically the section in the paper and the source code), and the expected outcome. This is illustrated in Fig. 11a.

Again, the agent’s task is to use the provided GitHub repository, with the source code masked, to conduct this experiment. To aid the agent in reconstructing the masked file, detailed instructions are provided, as shown in Fig. 11b.

Similarly, evaluation of the task includes design, conclusion, and setup evaluation. The conclusion appears in the ‘expected outcome’ in Fig. 11a. Design and setup evaluation are based on ‘design complexity’ and ‘requirement’ respectively, shown in Fig 12.

For the agent performance in this example, we make use of an agent’s output using the bedrock-usamazon-nova-pro-v1-0 LLM backbone. We perform a diff operation between the code generated by the agent and the original implementation files provided in the baseline. Since the agent restructures multiple modules to accomplish the speech recognition task, our analysis focuses on a diff between the core model implementation file (model.py) and the original reference. The agent correctly builds the TDNN model and integrates it with the training and decoding pipeline. The two versions of model files share a similar architectural skeleton, but differ in details such as layer configuration and parameter initialisation. The differences are shown in Fig. 13.

## F Dataset Curation and Benchmark Construction Details

To ensure the quality and integrity of EXP-Bench, we developed the curation pipeline through a careful, iterative process. Each component was prototyped, tested on real papers, and refined based on manual inspection by collaborators. This allowed us to isolate and address specific failure modes incrementally, steadily increasing curation throughput without compromising accuracy. Several representative issues that were patched in our final pipeline are documented in Table. 7. Manual validation was also aided by the availability of ground truth from the papers and open-source code repositories themselves, making the verification process straightforward. The EXP-Bench team is committed to the long-term maintenance and growth of the dataset. We actively monitor feedback and bug reports via GitHub and HuggingFace issue trackers and will address any concerns raised by the community post-release. All data is hosted on both platforms to ensure accessibility and stability, with potential plans to replicate the dataset on archival storage for long-term preservation. To foster transparency, reuse, and critical engagement, the dataset is released under the permissive Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 license, and all code under the MIT license. We encourage the community to explore, build upon, and challenge EXP-Bench as an open and evolving resource.

Time and Cost Expenditure. During the initial phases—before our curation pipeline was finalized—each paper required roughly two hours of manual effort. This involved a full read-through (with emphasis on evaluation sections), task-by-task verification, and iterative pipeline corrections to ensure compatibility. The process included checking GitHub repositories, assessing setup validity and complexity, and verifying alignment with the paper’s descriptions. Once the pipeline was fully

constructed and refined based on feedback, manual validation time dropped to around 20 minutes per paper, primarily to confirm alignment. Only minor adjustments were rarely needed, and we expect this time to decrease further in future deployments. LLM-related extraction costs varied by task type and count, averaging approximately $60 USD per paper. For extraction, we used o3-mini-2025-0101-preview for the main task extraction and claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0 for implementation extraction. Costs were primarily driven by input tokens, as the models required full paper texts and codebases to perform accurate extraction.

- G Extended Analysis on Prevalent Agent Failure Patterns Some overlap between categories may exist, as the classification was performed by an LLM.

## H Evaluation Judge

As detailed in the main text (§4.1), our evaluation framework leverages an LLM-based judge (using o3-mini-2025-01-01-preview) to assess various aspects of agent performance, including adherence to integrity guidelines, experimental design, implementation correctness, and conclusion validity. We provide the full system prompts used by our LLM judge in this section.

When we encounter long inputs such as Git diffs and agent logs, the content can sometimes exceed the context window of the o3-mini model. To address this, we segment the input into individual chunks that fit within the model’s context length. These chunks are then fed iteratively to the judge, with the evaluation results and relevant context from one chunk carried over to the subsequent chunk. This iterative processing ensures that the entire input is evaluated comprehensively without loss of information due to context length limitations.

Monitor Prompt. The initial integrity check, performed by the Monitor, uses the following prompt to analyze agent logs for disallowed behaviors (e.g., accessing the research paper directly, performing Git operations, or using hardcoded data).

Inspect the log to verify the following criteria:

- 1. The agent did NOT access (i.e., read) the research paper itself (e.g., the PDF).
- 2. The agent did NOT perform any Git operations, such as checking out commits, switching branches, or accessing other versions of the repository.
- 3. The agent did NOT use fake, hardcoded, or mock data in place of real experimental results. In particular, check for any signs of:

- - Hardcoded or fabricated data values used as results.
- - Use of mock or placeholder data instead of running actual experiments.
- - Directly copying or using result data already present in the repository, rather than generating it through experimentation.
- - Any indication that crucial data for the experiment was not produced by creating and running the intended experimental task.
- - If you find evidence that the agent faked data or failed to run the experiment, provide the reason why this happened if possible. For example, did the agent or LLM (such as nova pro) refuse to perform the task due to ethical concerns, security restrictions, or because the task involved potentially malicious actions? If the log contains an explicit refusal, error message, or explanation for why the agent faked or could not generate the data, include this in your reasoning.

Output format exactly as this JSON: {

"paper_access": <boolean>, "git_operations": <boolean>, "faked_or_nonexperimental_data": <boolean>, "setup_monitor_comprehensive_reason": "<comprehensive explanation for your

decisions on the above keys, including specific evidence from the log and your reasoning process. Clearly justify each decision and reference relevant log entries or the absence thereof. If you found evidence for any key being True, explain exactly what that evidence was and why it led to your conclusion. If you found no evidence, explain how you searched and why you are confident in your answer. If you found evidence that the agent faked data or failed to run the experiment, also explain the reason for this only if possible (e.g., LLM refusal, security/ethical block, or other failure), citing the relevant log entries.>"

}

Explanation of output keys:

- - "paper_access": True if the agent accessed the research paper, False otherwise.
- - "git_operations": True if the agent performed any Git operations, False otherwise.
- - "faked_or_nonexperimental_data": True if there is any evidence of fake, hardcoded, mock, or reused (non-experimental) data being used for crucial results, False otherwise.
- - "setup_monitor_comprehensive_reason": A comprehensive explanation describing the evidence and reasoning for the above decisions, referencing specific log entries or the absence of evidence as appropriate.

Here is the log: {logs}

Design and Conclusion Evaluation Prompt. Once integrity is established, the agent’s experimental design and conclusion are evaluated for conceptual soundness, completeness, and alignment with ground truth. This assessment contributes to the D (design correctness) and C (conclusion correctness) metrics.

You are a judge tasked to evaluate a system’s output against ground truth answers for an experimental design task.

Input fields:

- - design_ground_truth: the correct list of variables (constants, independent, dependent variables).
- - conclusion_ground_truth: the correct conclusion as a string.
- - design_output: the predicted design. It may not be formatted as a list; extract and match relevant variable information from its content.
- - conclusion_output: the predicted conclusion string. Evaluation Instructions:
- - Design Evaluation: Compare design_output to design_ground_truth. Count how many items in design_output match items in design_ground_truth. Return the percentage of correct items as an integer (e.g., use 75 to represent 75%), along with a short explanation. If applicable, include a failure analysis on what the system got wrong.
- - Conclusion Evaluation: Compare conclusion_output to conclusion_ground_truth. Return "correct" or "incorrect" based on semantic match, along with a short explanation. If applicable, include a failure analysis on what the system got wrong.

Here is the input: {{

design_ground_truth: {design_gt}, conclusion_ground_truth: {conclusion_gt}, design_output: {design_output}, conclusion_output: {conclusion_output}

}}

Output format exactly as this JSON: {{

"design_evaluation_explanation": "<short explanation string>", "design_score": <integer from 0 to 100>, "design_error_analysis": "<short explanation of what was wrong with the output, i.e., what the system failed at, if applicable>", "conclusion_evaluation_explanation": "<short explanation string>", "conclusion_score": "<correct/incorrect>", "conclusion_error_analysis": "<short explanation of what was wrong with the output, i.e., what the system failed at, if applicable>"

}}

Implementation Evaluation Prompt. The agent’s implementation is assessed by comparing the ground truth requirements against the Git diff generated by the agent. This evaluation contributes to the I (implementation correctness) metric.

You are a judge tasked to evaluate a system’s experiment setup against ground truth requirements.

Input fields:

- - setup_ground_truth: the correct experiment setup requirements, given as either a list of step-by-step required actions/configs or a natural language description.
- - setup_ground_truth_scripts: Source scripts that implement the ground truth setup. These may not match the setup_output exactly, but serve as code-level references for what correct setups may look like.
- - setup_output: the system’s actual changes, given as a Git diff patch (e.g., modifications to config files, scripts, etc.).

Evaluation Instructions:

- - Setup Evaluation:
- - Compare setup_output against setup_ground_truth. Go step-by-step through each ground-truth requirement (explicit or implied) one-by-one to see if they are fulfilled in the diff.
- - Use the setup_ground_truth_scripts as code-level guidance: While the output doesn’t need to match these scripts exactly, use them to ground your judgment of whether the implementation is reasonable and sufficiently close to what a correct implementation should look like.
- - Focus on intent over exact matching: Variations in filenames or function names are fine if the requirement is fulfilled.
- - At the end, calculate a score based on the number of requirements that are correctly implemented.
- - Return:
- - A score as an integer percentage (e.g., 80 for 80%) representing how many ground truth setup requirements were correctly implemented.
- - A detailed explanation of the evaluation result.
- - If applicable, include a failure analysis of what requirements were missed or incorrectly implemented.

Here is the input: {

"setup_ground_truth": {setup_gt}, "setup_ground_truth_scripts": {setup_scripts} "setup_output": {setup_output},

} Output format exactly as this JSON: {

"setup_evaluation_explanation": "<detailed explanation string>", "setup_score": <integer from 0 to 100>, "setup_error_analysis": "<Explanation of what was wrong with the setup, i.e., what requirements were missed or done incorrectly, if applicable>"

- I Additional Analysis We include detailed breakdowns of the analysis performed in §4.2.

- I.1 Conjunctive Evaluation Metrics Analysis In Fig. 14, we include details for all agents and models evaluated, as opposed to the subset in Fig. 6b.
- I.2 Cost-Time Distribution

We showcase the full cost–time distribution in Table. 9 in the form of summary statistics. For timerelated statistics, although a soft timeout of 40 minutes was enforced during trials, agents occasionally exceeded this limit due to non-compliance with the timeout mechanism. Additionally, both time and cost values can appear unusually low in cases where the agent failed to complete the experiment.
