#### Abstract

The attention mechanism of a transformer has a quadratic complexity, leading to high inference costs and latency for long sequences. However, attention matrices are mostly sparse, which implies that many entries may be omitted from computation for efficient inference. Sparse attention inference methods aim to reduce this computational burden; however, they also come with a troublesome performance degradation. We discover that one reason for this degradation is that the sparse calculation induces a distributional shift in the attention outputs. The distributional shift causes decoding-time queries to fail to align well with the appropriate keys from the prefill stage, leading to a drop in performance. We propose a simple, novel, and effective procedure for correcting this distributional shift, bringing the distribution of sparse attention outputs closer to that of quadratic attention. Our method can be applied on top of any sparse attention method, and results in an average 36%pt performance increase, recovering 88% of quadratic attention accuracy on the 131K RULER benchmark when applied on top of sliding window attention with sink tokens while only adding a small overhead. Our method can maintain approximately 98.5% sparsity over full quadratic attention, making our model 32 times faster than Flash Attention 2 when processing 1M token prefills.

#### 1 Introduction

The main operation that powers modern transformers, self-attention [Vaswani et al., 2017], creates causal pairwise comparisons for every item in a sequence. While powerful and expressive, this operation comes with a quadratic complexity, leading to the need for large amounts of computation during inference on long sequences. This increases direct costs for hardware and electricity as well as negative externalities such as CO2 emissions. Training-free sparse attention modifications aim to lower the quadratic complexity at inference time, but come with unwanted side effects such as accuracy degradation due to the sparsification of the attention matrix.

39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025).

Recent works on sparse attention have found that a sparse sliding window can be added at inference time without a total loss of model stability. This is accomplished by saving a small number of initial tokens, and applying a sliding window on all subsequent tokens (Streaming LLM [Xiao et al., 2023]). Subsequent works such as Star Attention [Acharya et al., 2024] have proposed a similar sparse prefill strategy with a fully dense decoding procedure to generate new tokens. This strategy has the positive attribute of a sparse prefill while still performing attention with all tokens during generation. This should allow the model to accurately recall context buried deep within the prompt. However, we find that this is not the case in practice. For example, there is a challenging subset of the RULER [Hsieh et al., 2024] benchmark titled MultiKey-3, which consists entirely of unique UUID keys and values, and the large language model (LLM) must be able to recall the proper value for a particular key in order to get a correct answer. In this setting, a sliding window of 2048 tokens provides more than adequate room for encoding individual key and value pairs together within the window. One would then expect that a dense decode procedure would be able to retrieve the proper UUID given a user query. However, we find that this is not the case and the dense decode achieves a surprisingly low accuracy of 0% as opposed to 62% when using quadratic attention.

We find this drop in accuracy arises from a distributional shift in the output tokens of each layer due to the sparse prefill. This distributional shift causes problems with the query-key dot products in long contexts and therefore results in an extreme drop in performance as the queries no longer align with the expected keys. We study this problem and found a surprisingly simple fix which we dub ∆ Attention that improves the accuracy of sliding window attention from 0% to 44% (Figure 1, NIAH MK3) on this challenging subset while maintaining more than 11-fold speedup over plain Flash Attention 2 [Dao,

- 2023] for processing 131K context lengths (Figure 2). Through evaluations on perplexity, natural language understanding, and synthetic tasks, we demonstrate that our method consistently results in better performance while maintaining the low latency of the sparse prefill. Our contributions are as follows:

- • We identify a distributional shift in tokens when applying an inference-time sparse attention method to pretrained transformers, which interferes with query-key alignment on long contexts and leads to a drop in performance.
- • We introduce Delta (∆) Attention, a sparse post-processing correction that realigns sparse outputs with full quadratic attention.
- • Our method adds negligible latency overhead compared to plain sparse attention, while drastically increasing performance over purely sparse methods.
- • Our method is designed to work in the attention output space, so it can be seamlessly integrated with existing sparse attention kernels and inference pipelines without major modification.

#### 2 Background & Related Work

The self attention mechanism of a transformer takes an input sequence X ∈ RN×d of individual tokens xi ∈ Rd for i ∈ {1..N}. After applying linear projections WQ,WK,WV ∈ Rd×d to the input X to achieve the respective Q,K,V matrices, positional encodings such as [Su et al., 2024] are applied to Q and K. With σ representing the softmax operation over the last dimension, the self-attention operation for an arbitrary layer in a transformer is the following,

##### XWV (1)

We omit the output projections, attention heads, and post-attention multilayer perceptrons (MLPs). For a deeper discussion of these topics in transformers, please see [Vaswani et al., 2017]. The most expensive operation in Equation (1) that arises from the multiplication inside σ() which results in the implicit construction of an attention matrix A ∈ RN×N which is computationally expensive for

large N. Due to the causality condition of language, a token xi may only influence another token xj where the index i ≤ j. In practice, this means that only the lower triangle of A is computed.

After traversing through the layers of the network, the next token in the sequence xN+1 is generated (predicted) and added to the input sequence to generate the next token and so on until the sequence terminates. In this generation phase, each iteration may use the previously computed tokens, which are stored within a cache at each layer, so that we may avoid re-calculating the entire attention matrix in Equation (1). With a union operator ∪ which concatenates matrices by adding new rows, and considering that K,V contain tokens with indices {1..N}, and the newly generated token has index i = N + 1, the generative process for the next token proceeds through the attention layers as,

q⊤i K ∪ k⊤i ⊤

(a⊤v)i = σ

Sparse attention prefill methods aim to reduce the quadratic computation in Equation (1) by computing a subset of entries within A, forming a sparse matrix A∗ where the number of computed entries

2 with minimal information loss. However, in practice, large portions of the attention matrix are ignored, which may cause unintended differences in the output tokens and lead to unexpected behavior of future query-key dot products, which could degrade performance on downstream tasks. Previous works have studied in-context learning (ICL) processes such as induction heads [Olsson et al., 2022], which are responsible for copying relevant content from earlier tokens into later tokens in the sequence [Musat, 2024]. Induction heads are known to be more prevalent in the lower layers of the network [Yin and Steinhardt, 2025], which implies that a distributional mismatch between queries and keys at the lower layers of the network will inhibit ICL processes. Additionally, Wu et al. [2024] showed that these induction or retrieval heads are universal for all transformer model types and further highlighted that interfering with these special attention heads causes a catastrophic drop in performance on downstream tasks during inference.

Recent works on sparse attention, such as Streaming LLM [Xiao et al., 2023], have shown that a pretrained quadratic transformers can be modified on-the-fly at test time into a stable sparse attention model by utilizing sink tokens and sliding windows. This has inspired a multitude of recent works that utilize this knowledge for inference time adaptations that selectively prune the less important ‘middle’ tokens from the KV-cache during inference. Two approaches, H2O [Zhang et al., 2024b] and SnapKV [Li et al., 2024] accomplish this by looking at historical attention scores to decide which tokens to prune. However, these works still leave the quadratic prompt in place, which requires a computation overhead of O(n2).

Other recent works have therefore made efforts to lower the complexity of the prompt as well. Big Bird [Zaheer et al., 2020] studies the effect of randomly choosing keys for every new query in the attention matrix. However, random key selection has been shown to underperform a more targeted selection of keys in HiP Attention [Lee et al., 2024a,b], which applies a tree-based pruning mechanism that masks out less important blocks of keys in order to sparsify the computation of the attention matrix. MInference [Jiang et al., 2024] studies reliably recurring patterns in the attention matrix of specific attention heads, and builds a set of sparse kernels which apply sparse attention following these patterns.

To illustrate how our findings integrate with these prior works, we provide an example in Figure 3. In this experiment, we use quadratic attention and Streaming LLM to prefill a 131K length input from the RULER benchmark. We then compute the cosine similarity cos([A∗V]i,[AV]i) of the sparse and quadratic outputs, and also construct the last part of the full attention matrix using the

The result is an approximation to the original quadratic attention.

last 128 queries in order to compare the rank correlation coefficient ρ(A∗i,Ai) in the final rows of the attention matrix. If the sparse attention method does not cause a distributional shift, then the attention outputs should have a high cosine similarity to quadratic attention, and sorting the rows of the attention matrix should lead to the same sort order, which implies that the relative importance (ranking) between queries and keys has been maintained. As seen in Figure 3, in both dimensions, the sparse attention of Streaming LLM causes a drift in the distribution of tokens, which causes the degradation in task performance seen in Figure 1. However, we find we can correct this distributional shift with the addition of a ∆ term which we will describe in the following section.

###### Full Attention Output

Sparse Attention Output Missing Area

Given the distributional shift shown in Figure 3, our method answers the following question: How may we shift the distribution of attention outputs such that they are closer to the representation which is expected during quadratic attention? Specifically, we wish to add a term to the sparse attention output A∗V such that we recover the attention contribution A∆V from the places where sparse attention has

given zero weight. This region is usually located somewhere inside the lower triangle of the attention matrix and resembles a delta shape. We propose to approximate this ∆ region by a simple difference of attention outputs, as geometrically depicted in Figure 5. Specifically,

##### A∆V ≈ AV − A∗V (3)

Note that the softmax normalization of sparse attention methods generally only computes the normalization constant over the nonzero values. Thus, A and A∗ have different normalization constants, which makes the relation an approximation. We consider A and A∆ to share the same softmax normalization constant. Let the full attention softmax normalization constant be T + H, and the sparse attention normalization constant be T.

Lemma 1. w.l.o.g. Consider an arbitrary row in the attention matrix a and arbitrary column of the values v, with both a and v being sorted according to rank of a such that a = (ar(1) ≤ ar(2) ≤ ··· ≤ ar(N)). For a top-k sparse attention matrix which only computes the top-k attention scores, one only needs to compute a∗⊤v = NN−k+1 a∗ivi. With ∆ = a⊤v − a∗⊤v, we may bound the error of our attention approximation as,

We ultimately seek a shift in the attention outputs such that A∗V + ∆ ≈ AV. Trivially, if we choose ∆ = AV − A∗V, we have exact equality; however, calculating A requires the full

quadratic attention procedure that we wish to avoid. As AV − A∗V ≈ A∆V, if we further assume that (A∆V)i ≈ (A∆V)i+ν for ν ∈ {1,...,γ} and γ ∈ N, then we may approximate (AV)i+ν ≈ (A∆V)i + (A∗V)i+ν. Under this approximation, one only needs to compute every γth row of the attention matrix, which maintains a sparse computation by only computing a subset of rows of A. To do this, we select a fixed fraction of row indices from Q, such that,

γ⌋ = Qi =⇒ i mod γ = 0; ∀ i ∈ {1 .. N} (4)

Q⌊ i

and therefore AV = σ( QK⊤)V which is sparse in the query dimension, but dense in the key dimension. One possible approach would be to substitute this representation into the appropriate rows of the sparse output A∗V such that the final representation A, is the following,

##### AV

make a dense output row if i mod γ = 0 {i mod γ = 0} AV⌊ i

γ⌋ − (A∗V)⌊ i

= (A∗V)i +

γ⌋γ ; ∀ i ∈ {1 .. N} (5)

i

We dub this approach as ‘recompute’, as we are essentially using the sparse representation with some densely computed output tokens interwoven at regular intervals. However, we find that this approach still does not shift the distribution of attention outputs far enough towards the expected representation under quadratic attention (see Figure 9). Therefore, in order to apply a shift to all tokens in the output of A∗V while maintaining a sparse computation, we instead apply the following correction to the sparse attention output,

##### AV

= (A∗V)i + (A∆V)⌊ i

γ⌋γ (6)

i

##### = (A∗V)i + AV ˜ ⌊ i

###### γ⌋ − (A∗V)⌊ i

(7)

γ ⌋γ ∆ correction term

Which is equivalent to swapping in a dense row of the attention matrix at every γth row, and applying the difference between the dense and sparse attention for the previous γth row otherwise. A visual depiction of this process can be seen in Figure 4, and pseudocode in Algorithm 1. Since our method is applied directly on the attention outputs, we may utilize existing sparse attention kernels to compute A∗V and make use of a minimally modified flash attention kernel to compute our query-sparse attention AV˜ .

Algorithm 1: ∆ Attention Algorithm Require: f(), f∗() Q,K,V, γ

// sparse attention for all of Q

##### A∗V ← f∗(Q,K,V) Q ← Equation 4

// dense attention every γth query

##### AV˜ ← f( Q,K,V)

// collect proper indices for ∆ construction

###### δ ← {i | i mod γ = 0} ∆ ← AV˜ − (A∗V)i∈δ

Assuming that a row index j of the attention matrix is not evenly divisible by γ, this means that an attention differential from a previous row is being applied to the current row j. The intuition from this operation comes from prior works which have studied attention locality [Lee et al., 2024a], finding that the difference between attention scores for neighboring tokens is generally small. Likewise, our conjecture is that the low attention score regions from neighboring rows of the attention matrix also have a negligible difference, allowing for the less important part of the row of the attention matrix to be reused multiple times. Specifically, as stated above Equation (4), we assume that (A∆V)i ≈ (A∆V)i+ν for ν ∈ {1,...,γ} and γ ∈ N. To validate this assumption, we examine the average cosine similarity of (A∆V)i within a γ window on an input from the RULER 131K task set for various values of γ in Figure 6b. We find a high average cosine similarity within the window, implying that (A∆V)i may be reused for multiple rows of the attention output.

AV = A∗V + repeat(∆,γ) return AV

#### 4 Experiments

We evaluate our method in terms of perplexity (PPL) and long context perplexity using the LongPPL [Fang et al., 2024] metric on a QA version of the PG19 [Rae et al., 2019] test set, which was recently proposed as a long context understanding dataset [He et al., 2025]. We also provide

evaluations of our method on the RULER [Hsieh et al., 2024] benchmark, which tests models’ performance under a number of long context retrieval tasks. Additionally, we evaluate our ∆ Attention on Infinite-Bench [Zhang et al., 2024a], and also provide analysis that evaluates the effect of our ∆ correction on the distribution of attention outputs and scores, and overall attention latency. Our work considers that the decoding process shown in Equation (2) is dense along the key dimension and should be able to successfully learn from previously encoded information during the sparse prefill.

We apply our method in conjunction with the sparse attention methods Streaming LLM [Xiao et al., 2023], HiP [Lee et al., 2024a,b], and MInference [Jiang et al., 2024], on models from the Llama [Dubey et al., 2024] (3.1 and 4), and Mistral [Jiang et al., 2023] model families. Unless otherwise noted, our standard setting uses γ = 64 which means we calculate every 64th query row (approximately 98.5% sparsity) in the attention computation required by ∆ Attention.

RULER. For baselines on needle-in-a-haystack type tasks, we compare our method in addition to Streaming LLM, HiP, and MInference for both Llama and Mistral models. In all cases, ∆ Attention shows a large improvement upon the given sparse methods, and especially at the longer context lengths in Table 1. In particular, we note an improvement of nearly 37%pt over Streaming LLM with the same 2K window size for 131K with Llama 3.1. For Streaming LLM, if we adjust for the extra computation needed by our method, we find that the approximate window size of our method is 3072 (see Section F for calculation). This is due to the fact that we also use a sliding window of 2048 and compute every 64th row of the lower triangle in the attention matrix. Therefore, even when Streaming LLM is allowed a higher computational budget of a 4K window, ∆ Attention still results in an increase of 34%pt, more than doubling the accuracy of Streaming LLM (+112%, relative). Even when Streaming LLM is allowed a 32K window, Streaming LLM + ∆ with a 2K window still delivers higher accuracy.

Table 2: Perplexity on PG19 Long QA [He et al., 2025]. Our simple ∆ correction results in a significant drop in both PPL and Long PPL.

Perplexity (PPL) and Long Perplexity (LongPPL). We generated a QA dataset based on the PG19 test set according to the procedure outlined by He et al. [2025]. This results in a long context task where an entire book is used as context, along with a series of LLM-generated questions and answer pairs with total context lengths of approximately 100K. In order to excel at this task, a model must be able to retain all information and facts from the text, which may be asked in the follow-up QA session. We evaluate both PPL and LongPPL, where the latter metric selects a subset of tokens that are found to rely heavily on long context for the final loss calculation. LongPPL has been shown to have a stronger correlation with long context performance over PPL [Fang et al., 2024]. We use Llama 3.1 8B instruction-tuned models for this experiment. Results can be seen in Table 2 and Figure 6. When

average cosine similarity between the approximate (A∆V)i and (A∆V)i+ν for ν ∈ {1,...,γ} for Streaming LLM and finds a high similarity within a γ neighborhood of attention outputs. High

similarity implies (A∆V)i can be reused within the γ neighborhood.

our ∆ Attention is applied on top of both HiP and Streaming LLM, we achieve between a 50-75% reduction in the PPL performance gap between quadratic attention. This trend holds true for both PPL and LongPPL. Figure 6 shows the effect of varying the γ parameter form 8-256. As γ also controls the sparsity, we find that as the sparsity increases, both perplexity metrics tend to rise.

Infinite Bench. [Zhang et al., 2024a] For both LLama 3.1 8B and Llama 4 Scout 109B, results are displayed in Table 3. The display colors are encoded to show the performance difference within each model group, and including flash attention in all groups. For Llama 4 (Streaming LLM), the addition of ∆ resulted in an increase of 40%pt, which leads to recapturing 82% of quadratic attention accuracy (up from 41%). Similarly, for Llama 3.1, the addition of ∆ increased overall performance by 29%pt, which moves from 20% of full attention accuracy to recovering 67%. The realized performance gains when applying our method to HiP result in a 10%pt increase for Llama 3.1 and a 0.5%pt increase for Llama 4. Note that HiP with Llama 4 only shows a total of 1.5%pt gap in performance, which means that ∆ Attention was able to recapture 33% of the total performance gap.

Latency. For a single attention layer, our method shows a large reduction in latency when compared to Flash Attention 2 benchmarked at 1M tokens. In Figure 7, HiP + ∆ runs more than 8 times faster. For Streaming LLM + ∆ this factor increases to over 32, which means that ∆ Attention may perform more than 32 attention operations for a single quadratic Flash Attention 2 operation. While our method does require more computation than the standalone sparse methods in Figure 7b, the relative increase is modest in comparison to the latency of quadratic attention. MInference has been excluded from these latency results due to the current public implementation not fully utilizing hardware parallelization in this experiment.

(b) Latency vs. Sparse Methods

(c) Latency for increasing γ

- Figure 7: (a) shows latency comparisons against flash attention at 1M tokens. Our method maintains most of the large latency reductions of sparse methods. (b) compares latency against plain sparse methods. Our method introduces a slight overhead due to requiring computation equivalent to 1.5% of the whole attention matrix. (c) evaluates the effect of different γ parameters on latency. We find that increasing the stride between queries leads to an expected decrease in latency.

How does the ∆ affect attention outputs and scores? To study the effect of the ∆ correction on the attention outputs and scores, we evaluate both attention output cosine similarity and the Spearman rank correlation coefficient [Spearman, 1904] of the attention rows for the last 128 queries of the prefill. For this, we used a sample from the MultiKey-3 RULER (131K) benchmark with the Llama3.1 8B instruction tuned model. A subset of layers is depicted in Figure 9, where each point in the plot and histogram is a random sample from one of the 32 ×128 (attention heads and queries). Additional plots for all layers in the network can be seen in Figures 13 to 15 in the appendix. At the key lower layers where the induction heads are known to be most prevalent, we find that the ∆ correction results in a large corrective shift in both the rank correlation and cosine similarity, making both metrics much closer to the ground truth distributions of quadratic attention. Notably, only using ‘Recompute’, which densely recomputes some rows of the attention matrix, is not enough to shift the distribution,

- as it is indistinguishable from the plain Streaming LLM model in Figure 9.

In Section 1, we stated that ∆ Attention shifts the distribution of attention outputs towards the distribution which would be seen under fully quadratic attention. Figure 9 provides three more examples of lower layers which show the same shift as shown in Figure 3. It is notable, however, that this strong shift towards the distribution of quadratic attention is not present in all layers of the network. Figures 13 to 15 together show all layers. ∆ Attention appears to maintain a strong similarity to quadratic attention at the lower layers, which gradually dissipates until layer 10, when the three methods become indistinguishable. However, there is a sudden rise in attention output cosine similarity again towards the last layers of the network

While both the output cosine similarity and the rank correlation are important, the high rank correlation coefficient provides a crucial insight as to how the ∆ correction aids in improving performance. For sparse methods, the last 128 queries from a 131K context have undergone a distributional shift induced by the sparse method, which means that they no longer correctly align with the appropriate key tokens during dot-product attention. A high rank correlation, however, implies that the ranking (importance order) of dot products across an entire row of the attention matrix remains largely intact and therefore, should result in outputs with higher similarity to quadratic attention outputs. This suggests that dense decoding can now effectively access information buried deep in the prompt, which is something our experiments show sparse attention methods struggle to do.

Does Equation (5) or Equation (6) Perform Better? In the previous paragraph we gave qualitative examples of the difference between Equation (5) and Equation (6) on the attention output cosine similarity. Now we ask, how does this observed difference affect the performance of the model? Table 4 shows the effect of ‘recompute’ from Equation (5), which recomputes a selected number of queries with dense attention and does not apply the difference to subsequent tokens in the γ neighborhood. Only recomputing tokens results in a 37%pt increase over all context lengths and is only 3%pt short of matching ∆. However, at the longest context length, ∆ still delivers a more than 11%pt increase in accuracy.

- Figure 8 shows ‘recompute’ compared to ∆ Attention for individual subsets of the RULER-131K context length. We find that the only case where ‘recompute’ outperforms our method is on the

We find that for both measures, ∆ Attention is more similar to quadratic attention.

variable tracking subset (VT). We are unsure of the cause of this anomaly, although it is important to note that ‘recompute’ even outperformed flash attention by approximately 15%pt, which implies that there is some structure within this task that happened to benefit from ‘recompute’. In general, flash attention should represent an upper bound to sparse attention, which is what we observe in general. Note that the CWE subset of RULER is removed from this plot, as all methods (including flash attention) score 0% on the 131K context length.

#### 5 Discussion & Limitations

Flash Attention

Str. LLM + Recompute

Our method presented thus far has been a simple extension to existing sparse attention methods, which can be applied with a minimal addition of overhead and a very simple modification to the attention layer. The common way of computing sparse attention in prior work is to compute an attention output that is dense in the queries and sparse in the keys, so that there is at least one output for every input query token. One way to view our ∆ Attention extension is that we are mixing a key-sparse (and query-dense) attention output with a query-sparse (and key-dense) attention output in order to arrive at a representation which is closer to the quadratic attention output that is dense in both the queries and keys.

The idea of viewing attention sparsity from both dimensions holds the potential for future works to explore novel ways of combining various combinations of sparse methods in order to approximate the full attention operation. With Lemma 1, we were able to show that the difference of attention outputs approximates the missing attention output, however, we only have empirical evidence of the secondary approximation that (A∆V)i ≈ (A∆V)i+ν for ν ∈ {1,...,γ}. While this is empirically validated in our experiments and by the high cosine similarity in Figure 6b, future works may study this approximation further, which could lead to creating a smarter selection criteria for the query sparse attention, as our method uses only a fixed hyperparameter to set the size of the gap between query tokens.

#### 6 Conclusion

In this work, we first diagnose a harmful distributional shift induced by sparse attention prefill methods. We then propose a remedy with our lightweight, sparse-kernel agnostic ∆ Attention procedure. ∆ Attention corrects sparse outputs to align better with full quadratic attention outputs, requiring only a small post-processing step that can be integrated seamlessly into existing inference pipelines. Across all benchmarks, and especially at the longest context lengths, our method delivers significant accuracy gains while maintaining high sparsity and low latency.

#### B Broader Impact

We are not aware of any negative potential impacts of our work beyond impacts that are general to all machine learning models. However, lowering the computational cost for inference has the potential to lower costs such as electricity consumption, hardware requirements, and latency for end users. If this can effectively be done with minimal degradation in the performance of the underlying model, it will likely be beneficial to both producers and consumers of AI models.

#### C Implementation Details

In addition to the index selection in Equation (4), in practice, we also select a block of queries for dense recomputation at the end of the prefill sequence, which makes the part of the prefill which requires a delta correction evenly divisible by γ. We do this for both ease of implementation and also to provide the decoding tokens with the most accurate block of recent context. The block of queries at the end of the sequence allows us to simply reshape a tensor and project the ∆ correction onto every element in the block, as the tensor that needs a delta correction will have a regular size that is divisible by γ.

#### D Compute Resources

For LLM inference on benchmark datasets, we use Google Cloud Platform’s 8x NVIDIA H100 node. For latency measurements, we use a standalone machine with an NVIDIA RTX 4090 in order to have a controlled environment. Here, we show the detailed specification of the latency benchmarking machine:

CPU AMD Ryzen 7950X, 16 Core, 32 Thread RAM 128GB, DDR5 5600 Mhz GPU Nvidia RTX 4090, VRAM 24GB PCIe Gen 4.0 x8 OS Ubuntu 22.04.4 LTS GPU Driver 535.171.04

#### E Latency of MInference with Delta Attention

We did not report the latency of MInference in the main paper, because MInference shows unusually slower latency than other tested methods, including Flash Attention. We think this is due to (1)

- Figure 10: Latency measurements for different settings of γ which controls the gap size between queries and also the overall sparsity of the calculation. This figure accompanies the latency ablation for Streaming LLM in the main text, Figure 7c.

insufficient optimization of the publicly available kernel 1 and (2) MInference uses a for-loop across the head dimension that prevents the head dimension from being parallelized within the GPU. This limitation of the publicly available implementation will cause the latency to suffer if the attention calculation for each head does not fully utilize the hardware. This for-loop structure was likely implemented in this way because MInference uses different sparse attention strategies for each head. Therefore, as MInference is algorithmically faster than flash attention, we do not report the latency in Figure 7, as this would be misleading to readers who are not familiar with the low-level details of the implementations.

We capture the kernel latencies and hardware utilization for MInference. In our analysis with Nsight Systems, their vertical slash pattern kernel ‘_triton_mixed_sparse_attn_fwd_kernel’, shows around 32 milliseconds latency for a single head, while flash attention shows only 462 milliseconds for 32 heads. The MInference kernel shows noticeably low utilization of streaming multiprocessor warps, which is around 9%.

However, for completeness, we put the latency measurements of MInference in Table 5. In our measurement using their official codebase without meaningful modification, with pre-compiled model configuration for head-wise sparse method settings, Minference is about 1.377 times slower than Flash Attention. We believe this is only due to the lack of a fully parallelized kernel and not the design of the method.

#### F Approx Window Size Calculation

When comparing out method to Streaming LLM, we would like to know how much computation overhead is increased in order to estimate the approximate window size of our method due to the fact that ∆ Attention computes extra tokens. We can calculate this as follows with C as the context size, and w as the window size in a single row of the attention matrix, our method will

1https://github.com/microsoft/MInference

compute every γth row of the attention matrix which would be equivalent to 2Cγ when amortized into each row calculation. This brings the total calculation per row to w + 2Cγ. In the case of 131K context, a window size of 2048, and γ = 64 (our standard setting) this would be evaluated as 2048 + 2

17

2(26) = 2048 + 210 = 2048 + 1024 = 3072.

#### G Restatement and proof of Lemma 1

We want to show that the difference of A∆V ≈ AV − A∗V is approximately equal to the missing delta-shaped attention output, which is pictured in Figure 5. w.l.o.g., we will consider a single arbitrary row of the attention matrix a and a single column vector from the values v. The following is true regardless of the selected entries in a, however, in order to create a tighter error bound, we assume the existence of a sparse attention method which chooses the largest attention values in a when calculating the sparse dot product v⊤a∗. Specifically,

Lemma (Lemma 1). Let ¯a = (¯a1,...,a¯d) ∈ Rd be the pre-softmax vector which is sorted and satisfies,

a¯1 ≤ a¯2 ≤ ··· ≤ a¯N, then any exact top-k sparse attention method which selects the top-k attention scores should select the last k elements of a. Fix an integer 1 ≤ k ≤ N. Define the head-sum H, tail-sum T, and normalization constant Z to be the following:

If we assume that T ≫ H as is the expected outcome with sparse attention, then the bound becomes tighter, as the denominator H + T ≫ H. This implies that better sparse top-k approximations will result in a lower error bound. We empirically verified this difference in Figure 11, which analyzes both the error bound and the empirical error on a real input from the RULER-131K subset. Figure 11a measures the bound and empirical error of an oracle top-k attention while Figure 11b measures the same bound and empirical error for Streaming LLM, which chooses a sliding window and attention sink. We find that the bound is generally tighter for the oracle top-k attention, but in both cases, the overall empirical approximation error remains low.

- Figure 11: Empirically analyzing the approximation and bound from Lemma 1. A more precise sparse top-k attention method, such as an oracle (a) maintains a tighter bound on the approximation error. Streaming LLM (b) results in a looser bound, however the empirical approximation error (solid lines) remains low in both methods.

#### H Extended Related Work

In addition to the related work cited in Section 2, there are a number of additional works which deal with related topics that we wish to highlight.

LESS [Dong et al., 2024] requires training a low rank cache compressor. LESS mentions differences in attention distributions between dense and sparse attention, however, the authors make no mention of the critical insight of our work, namely that a dense decode fails to properly align with the tokens resulting from a sparse prefill due to the distributional shift of the keys that is induced by the sparse prefill.

Cacheblend [Yao et al., 2024] proposes using one dense attention layer to identify important tokens, and then selectively recomputing these tokens in later layers to add missing parts of the sparse attention to cached KV pairs. Cacheblend proposed this as a way to augment and consolidate independently processed chunks of a RAG pipeline. In practice, however, this would effectively be similar to a "smart" sparse prefill method like HiP or MInference which fills in some of the missing tokens in the attention matrix which are outside of the local window context. As out experiments show, this is not always sufficient to fix the distributional shift between sparse and dense prefills.

APE [Yang et al., 2025] proposes temperature scaling and rescaling the attention post-hoc in order to correct any error introduced. However, APE misses the crucial insight of our work, namely that sparse and dense attention result in completely different token distributions which means that there is a problem of query-key matching during decoding. APE only considers query and key geometry as a function of a) position and b) input. They deduce that because they key states of the first few keys (sink tokens) are relatively stable, then the geometry of all other keys are also stable.

Rectified Sparse Attention [Sun et al., 2025] (a concurrent work) considers dense prefills and a sparse decoding procedure. Their sparse decoding procedure is similar to what we call “recompute” in Table 4 and Figures 8, 9 and 13 to 15 where we showed that this “recomptue” method is insufficient to mitigate the distributional shift in the outputs.

Comparisons to these extended related works, and to Star Attention [Acharya et al., 2024] can be seen in Table 6.

#### I RepoQA

We evaluate ∆ Attention on code understanding by using the RepoQA [Liu et al., 2024] dataset that asks the model to retrieve a function from a long block of input text. In this dataset, the long input text contains the code from many functions and the query contains a plain language description of what the function does. The model is then supposed to return back the correct function as output. We compare Streaming LLM with and without our delta correction in Table 7

#### J Interpolation

The method presented in Section 3 proposes to use a single delta correction at index i to influence the next i + γ − 1 attention outputs. This causes a discrete jump in the delta correction at every γth output. It may be the case that a better strategy would be to smooth out the transition or impute the delta corrections within the window by some imputation function. In Table 8, we look at three different possible imputation functions and evaluate the overall effect on RULER.

Table 7: RepoQA results for Streaming LLM and Streaming LLM + Delta. Plain FA3 is included for reference.

Algorithm 2: α,β,γ Filter Require: α,β,γ and ∆ vectors

- o ← zero vector like ∆
- p ← ∆0 v ← zero vector like p a ← zero vector like p

o ← ∆0 for i in [1,...,len(∆)] do

y ← ∆i

// update approx position and velocity

###### pˆ ← p + v + 0.5a vˆ ← v + a

// calculate difference between real and predicted position

###### r ← y − pˆ

// update position, velocity, and acceleration.

p ← pˆ+ αr v ← vˆ + βr a ← a + γr oi ← p

end for return o

Linear Interpolation. For linear interpolation, we first compute all delta corrections, and then produce mixing coefficients β ∈ [0,1] which linearly increase from [0,...,1]. Interpolation is then

performed between consecutive delta correction terms by the function ∆ˆk = (1 − βk)∆i + βk∆i+1. Each ∆ term will therefore expand into |k| = γ terms, such that the number of delta corrections now matches the sparse attention output size. These expanded, and smoothed delta corrections will be treated as the new correction term, providing a smoother transition between terms.

EMA. Instead of linear interpolation, which technically violates the causality of the attention mechanism by incorporating information from the future into the past, we may instead expand the delta correction term by repeating each vector γ times, and then perform an exponential moving average (EMA) over the full set of vectors using a coefficient β ∈ [0,1] and computing the EMA as ∆i = (1 − β)∆i−1 + β∆i. The EMA acts as a smoothing mechanism which smooths the transition between delta terms.

α,β,γ Filter. A third option is to use a Kalman style filter. We chose to use an α,β,γ filter where α is a position coefficient, β is a velocity coefficient, and γ is an acceleration coefficient. At each step, position, velocity, and acceleration are updated based on a mixture of the real position and the accumulated statistics for position, velocity, and acceleration. We consider every operation to be an elementwise scalar operation. The algorithm for the α, β, γ filter can be seen in Algorithm 2

Although there are slight improvements using these imputation methods in Table 8, no method shows conclusive improvements over our original method. However, we think delta smoothing or imputation shows a promising direction for future research.

#### K Statistical Significance Tests

We assess the statistical significance of the results presented in Table 1. For this, we use a one-sided paired permutation test to test the significance of the difference between the versions of Streaming LLM, HiP and MInference with and without our delta correct applied. The results are shown in Table 9. We split RULER tasks according to QA vs. non-QA retrieval tasks. The statistical significance shows a high correlation with the displayed colors in Table 1 and verifies that our results are statistically significant.

Table 9: Interpolation Experiments. Each entry is a p-value assessing whether or not our delta correction results in a significant improvement (significance level is p < 0.05).

#### NeurIPS Paper Checklist

##### 1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper’s contributions and scope?

Answer: [Yes] Justification: The claims made in the abstract and introduction are verified in our experiments conducted in Section 4. Guidelines:

- • The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper.
- • The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
- • The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
- • It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper.

###### 2. Limitations Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We have discussed limitations of our method in Section 5. Guidelines:

- • The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
- • The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
- • The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be.
- • The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
- • The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon.
- • The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size.
- • If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness.
- • While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.

##### 3. Theory assumptions and proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We have one theoretical result in Lemma 1, which was stated briefly in the main text. We have included a more detailed derivation and statement in Section G. This section was also referenced under the lemma in the main text.

Guidelines:

- • The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
- • All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and crossreferenced.
- • All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
- • The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide intuition.
- • Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
- • Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.

##### 4. Experimental result reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We have provided all necessary information to reproduce our results. Our method only relies on publicly available pretrained models. We have included experimental code as well.

Guidelines:

- • The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
- • If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not.
- • If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
- • Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.
- • While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example

- (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm.
- (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.
- (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
- (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

##### 5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The datasets we use are publicly available and cited. We generated one dataset according to a previous paper (PG19 Long QA), which has been included in our supplementary materials. The code for our experiments is included in the supplementary material.

Guidelines:

- • The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
- • Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/ public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
- • While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark).
- • The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https: //nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
- • The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
- • The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
- • At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if applicable).
- • Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.

##### 6. Experimental setting/details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results?

Answer: [Yes] Justification: We have one hyperparameter which is specified in Section 4. We have also provided Algorithm 1. Guidelines:

- • The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
- • The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
- • The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.

##### 7. Experiment statistical significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments?

Answer: [No]

Justification: Our method is deterministic and works on pretrained models. Therefore, there is no stochasticity present in order to report error bars. Instead we conduct a range of experiments on different datasets in Section 4 in order to verify that the results do not randomly favor our method for a particular experiment. However, we do provide a paired permutation test for the RULER experiments in Section K.

Guidelines:

- • The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
- • The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper.
- • The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions).
- • The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
- • The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
- • It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean.
- • It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified.
- • For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates).
- • If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

##### 8. Experiments compute resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments?

Answer: [Yes] Justification: We have stated the full range of compute resources in Section D. Guidelines:

- • The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
- • The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
- • The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
- • The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn’t make it into the paper).

##### 9. Code of ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?

Answer: [Yes] Justification: We have read the ethics guidelines, and we believe our paper conforms to them. Guidelines:

- • The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
- • If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation from the Code of Ethics.
- • The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

##### 10. Broader impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: In Section 1 we discuss the enormous costs and negative externalities caused by inference compute requirements. We also discuss the broader impacts in Section B.

Guidelines:

- • The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
- • If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
- • Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
- • The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.
- • The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
- • If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

##### 11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [NA] Justification: We create no new data or models to release, as our method proposes a modification to existing pretrained models for inference efficiency. Guidelines:

- • The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
- • Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters.
- • Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
- • We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.

##### 12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The datasets we use are publicly available and cited or included in the supplementary material. The dataset included in the supplementary material is a derivation of a publicly available dataset, and the method for constructing it has been cited in Section 4.

Guidelines:

- • The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.

- • The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
- • The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL.
- • The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
- • For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of that source should be provided.
- • If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset.
- • For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
- • If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the asset’s creators.

##### 13. New assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided alongside the assets?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We are releasing a QA test set which was specified by a previous work, but not released by those authors directly. We have generated the dataset according to their code, and are releasing it with our supplementary materials.

Guidelines:

- • The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
- • Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations, etc.
- • The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is used.
- • At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.

##### 14. Crowdsourcing and research with human subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)?

Answer: [NA] Justification: Not applicable Guidelines:

- • The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
- • Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main paper.
- • According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector.

##### 15. Institutional review board (IRB) approvals or equivalent for research with human subjects

Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: Not applicable. Guidelines:

- • The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
- • Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state this in the paper.
- • We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for their institution.
- • For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.

##### 16. Declaration of LLM usage

Question: Does the paper describe the usage of LLMs if it is an important, original, or non-standard component of the core methods in this research? Note that if the LLM is used only for writing, editing, or formatting purposes and does not impact the core methodology, scientific rigorousness, or originality of the research, declaration is not required.

Answer: [NA] Justification: Not applicable Guidelines:

- • The answer NA means that the core method development in this research does not involve LLMs as any important, original, or non-standard components.
- • Please refer to our LLM policy (https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2025/LLM) for what should or should not be described.
