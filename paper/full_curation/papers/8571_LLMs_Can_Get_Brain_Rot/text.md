### Abstract

We propose and test the LLM Brain Rot Hypothesis: continual exposure to junk web text induces lasting cognitive decline in large language models (LLMs). To unveil junk effects, we designed a novel controlled experiment on real Twitter/X corpora, by constructing junk and reverse-controlled datasets via two orthogonal operationalizations: M1 (engagement degree) and M2 (semantic quality), with matched token scale and training operations across conditions. Compared to the control group, continual pretraining of 4 LLMs on the junk dataset causes non-trivial declines (Hedges’ g > 0.3) on reasoning, long-context understanding, safety, and inflating “dark traits” (e.g., psychopathy, narcissism). The gradual mixtures of junk and control datasets also yield dose-response cognition decay: for example, under M1, ARC-Challenge with Chain-of-Thought drops 72.1 → 57.2 and RULER-CWE 83.7 → 52.3 as junk ratio rises from 0% to 100%.

Error forensics reveal several key insights. First, we identify thought-skipping as the primary lesion in reasoning: models increasingly truncate or skip chains. Second, partial but incomplete healing is observed: scaling instruction tuning and clean continual pre-training improve the declined cognition, yet cannot restore baseline capability, suggesting persistent representational drift rather than format mismatch. Finally, we discover that the popularity, a non-semantic metric, of a tweet is a better indicator of the Brain Rot effect than the length in M1. Together, the results provide significant, multi-perspective evidence that social effects of data could be a causal driver of LLM capability decay in continual pre-training, thereby motivating routine “cognitive health checks” for deployed and evolving LLMs.

### 1 Introduction

In 2024, the term “Brain Rot” was named the Oxford word of year (Oxford University Press, 2024) when it drew increasing concern in modern society. Brain rot refers to the deleterious effect on human cognition that comes from consuming large volumes of trivial and unchallenging online content (or junk data) due to Internet addiction. Research has linked such overexposure to impairments in sustained attention (Haliti-Sylaj & Sadiku, 2024), memory retrieval (Vedechkina & Borgonovi, 2021), and social cognition (Yousef et al., 2025; Firth et al., 2019). A study on a Turkish population further found that heavy social-media use is associated with higher psychological distress and shifts in personality traits (Satici et al., 2023).

In parallel to the rise of Brain Rot in human cognition, artificial intelligence, represented by Large Language Models (LLMs), grows to gain human-like cognition (Binz & Schulz, 2023) via learning from trillions of the very similar Internet data (Hoffmann et al., 2022; Henighan et al., 2020; Hestness et al., 2017). Because alongside the training, LLMs inevitably consume junk data alongside high-quality text, it is natural to ask whether an analogous “Brain Rot” can emerge in them. Understanding this phenomenon not only helps clarify LLM robustness and alignment but also informs us about the broader interplay between AI and

human cognitive health. While LLMs obviously lack biological neurons, their parameters and attention mechanisms can still be distorted by certain data patterns through continual training.

Prior work has identified data patterns that threaten LLM safety. For example, Qi et al. (2023) demonstrated that fine-tuning LLMs on malicious or benign supervised tasks can void safety alignment. Compared to fine-tuning or pre-training from scratch, continual pre-training (CPT) could be more vulnerable. CPT enables pre-trained LLMs to be updated on almost infinitely many and daily updated Internet data Zheng et al. (2025), but also makes it harder to curate high-quality data at such a scale. As an example of risks, LLMs can be taught to leak private information by poisoning pre-training data with crafted repetitive patterns (Panda et al., 2024). Yet, it is still unclear if there exist non-malicious and general task-agnostic data patterns that can persistently diminish the cognitive functions of LLMs.

In this work, we translate insights from human cognition to LLM cognition by establishing the LLM Brain Rot Hypothesis: continual pre-training on junk web text induces lasting cognitive decline in LLMs. As a pilot study, we focus on Twitter/X as the data source for several reasons: (i) Twitter posts are a prominent real-world source of low-effort, high-engagement content central to the brain rot narrative, for example, 65.3% participants using X/Twitter on prior human study (Satici et al., 2023); (ii) the platform’s metadata (e.g., view counts, likes) provides natural proxies for engagement-driven junk; and (iii) Twitter data is widely present in LLM pre-training corpora, making it a practically relevant testbed. As outlined in Fig. 1, we design controlled experiments comparing LLM behaviors after continual pre-training on junk versus control data constructed from Twitter/X posts via two junk metrics: M1 (engagement degree) selects short but highly popular posts that often engage users longer online; and M2 (semantic quality) flags content based on styles that draw users’ attention. Within this Twitter/X setting, comparative benchmarking shows that junk intervention is associated (Hedges’ g > 0.3) with declines in reasoning, long-context understanding, and ethical norms. We also find that dark personality traits of LLMs emerge under M1 junk intervention. Experiments on mixtures of junk and control data further demonstrate gradual dose responses: for example, under M1 intervention, ARC-Challenge (Clark et al., 2018) with Chain Of Thoughts (Wei et al., 2022) drops 72.1 → 57.2 and RULER-CWE (Hsieh

- et al., 2024) 83.7 → 52.3 as junk ratio rises from 0% to 100%. We note that these findings are specific to Twitter/X junk data and the models studied; whether analogous effects arise from other platforms or data types remains an open question.

Our major contributions include three-fold: (i) We propose the LLM Brain Rot Hypothesis and provide initial evidence for it through controlled experiments on Twitter/X data; (ii) Our detailed analysis uncovered fine-grained failure modes caused by junk intervention, including thought skipping in reasoning, and that popular data and short data contribute to different kinds of cognitive declines individually; and (iii) We examine potential post-hoc mitigation, observing that instruction tuning helps but cannot fully restore the declined

capabilities. Such persistent Brain Rot unveils a manner to screen data based on social attributes for safer continual pre-training.

### 2 Related Work

In prior work, the crucial role of data in pre- or post-training has been noticed. Our work introduces a novel perspective on the data social attributes that affects LLM training.

Data Quality in Pre-training. On the positive side, selecting high-quality data (e.g., good writing style, required expertise, facts & trivia, and educational value) can improve the robustness and the generalization of pre-trained models (Wettig et al., 2024). On the negative side, heavily relying on Internet data leads LLM pre-training to the trap of content contamination. For example, the widespread use of LLMs causes more and more generated content on the Internet, contaminating the pre-training corpus and resulting in the forgetting of tail-distribution (model collapse) (Shumailov et al., 2023; 2024; Seddik et al., 2024). Even worse, Internet users can manipulate only 0.1% of data to implant malicious behaviors (e.g., denials of service, belief manipulation) in the pre-training, which is persistent after further post-training (Zhang et al., 2024).

Data Quality in Post-training. The quality of data is also critical in post-training, particularly in alignment of LLM responses toward human preference (Christiano et al., 2017; Bai et al., 2022b). Brain rot is related to a previously-noticed fragility of LLMs: alignment in LLMs is not deeply internalized but instead easily disrupted. Prior studies have shown the superficial nature of alignment: It can be achieved using small amounts of high-quality data (Zhou et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2025; Raghavendra et al., 2024), and therefore can be easily undone by jailbreaking (Zou et al., 2023) or few-shot fine-tuning on common tasks (Qi et al., 2023). Even modest data shifts during preference fine-tuning can dramatically affect safety, with models reverting to unsafe on unseen data (Wang et al., 2025) or being implanted with malicious behaviors (Fu et al., 2024).

Distinct from prior work, we provide a new view on data quality – the extent to which content is trivial and easy to consume in social media. The properties themselves, conceptualized via tweet shortness/popularity or content semantics, are not intuitively associated with the traditional LLM cognitive functions, and thereby overlooked in past benchmarks.

#### 3 LLM Brain Rot Hypothesis In this section, we test the LLM Brain Rot Hypothesis by a controlled experiment.

- 3.1 Controlled Experiment Methodology We conceptualize the Brain Rot hypothesis in the context of LLM as continual pre-training LLMs on junk data. We define junk data in two distinct measurable ways, based on which we subsample a social-media dataset to create intervention (junk) and control datasets. As outlined in Fig. 1, we use controlled experiments to test the hypothesis, i.e., contrasting the cognitive functions of the two groups of LLMs: LLMs fed with junk and LLMs with control data. The essence of a controlled experiment, rather than directly analyzing the junk intervention, stems from the fact that clean fine-tuning could dramatically change LLM behaviors, e.g., safety (Qi et al., 2023). An effective intervention should cause significant cognitive change with respect to the control group.

Defining Junk Data from the First Principle. Recalling Brain Rot is a consequence of Internet addiction in human cognition, we define junk data as content that can maximize users’ engagement in a trivial manner. Based on the principle, we propose two metrics to formulate junk data.

M1: Engagement Degree. As the proposed principle aligns with the design objective of Twitter’s recommendation algorithm, we can follow the definition in (X Corp., 2023) to formulate the engagement of a post as the number of likes, retweets, and replies. The association between the algorithmic tweet feed and engagement was also evidenced by Milli et al. (2025). In addition, from the marketing perspective, shortening tweets is a trivial method that can greatly improve the engagement (Malhotra et al., 2011). Therefore, we augment the definition of engagement-based junk standard to include two factors: popularity

– the total number of likes, retweets, replies, and quotes; length – the number of tokens in a tweet. More popular but shorter tweets will be considered to be junk data, vice versa.

M2: Semantic Quality. One limitation of M1 is that it does not consider the content semantics at all. For example, a well-written and concise tweet could gain a lot of attention and may not necessarily result in a bad influence on human brains. Orthogonal to M1, we use semantic quality to define the junk data. We draw inspiration from marketing research, where multiple strategies in composing tweets have been effective in increasing the chance of retweeting. Typical tweet styles include using attention words, such as hashtag, WOW, LOOK, or TODAY ONLY, that are capitalized to gain more attention (Malhotra et al., 2011; Suh et al., 2010). These styles favor attention over depth, aligning with the trivial nature of junk data. Together, we define junk data as content with superficial topics (e.g., conspiracy theories or exaggerated claims) and attention-drawing styles (e.g., clickbait language or excessive trigger words).

Junk/Control Data Formula. Based on the two metrics, we subsample the 1-million public Twitter/X posts to construct junk and control datasets, separately. The dataset was collected in 20231, which includes detailed information like the number of retweets, etc., in 2021-

- 2023. First, we filter the dataset to exclude samples that are not encoded in ASCII. We then subsample data. For M1, we choose samples with a token length < 30 (the corpus median) and a popularity of > 500 (the 97th percentile) as junk data, and samples with a token length > 100 (the 99th percentile) and a popularity of = 0 as control data. As the maximal number of available control data tokens is 1.22 million, we balance the number of tokens in junk data to the same scale. For M2, we prompt GPT-4o-mini to classify a tweet as high-quality or junk. The prompt is given in Fig. 8. The high-quality criteria are based on (Wettig et al.,
- 2024). Detailed data processing is summarized in Appendix B.

- M1 Blends Semantic and NonSemantic Metrics. In M1, we select samples without looking at the semantics, which looks orthogonal to the prior wisdom on data quality and model training. Therefore, we are asking how the two metrics are correlated. In Fig. 2, we demonstrate the relation between the two factors in M1 and M2 metrics, respectively. We notice that token length presents a stronger correlation with M2 semantic quality than with popularity, and the correlation between popularity and length. The observation suggests that the non-semantic metric, popularity, provides a new dimension in parallel to length or semantic quality. The correlation aligns with previous research in LLM-as-a-Judge: LLMs prefer longer responses in selecting preference data for alignment (Zheng et al., 2023; Saito et al., 2023; Hu et al., 2024). Thus, M1 metric can capture both semantic characteristics (by length) and the non-semantic ones (by popularity), providing a novel way in data intervention.
- M2 Data Quality Aligns with Human Preferences. In the right panel of Fig. 2, we compare GPT-predicted labels with human judgments from three graduate student annotators using the same rubric (see Appendix B). The confusion matrix shows 76% agreement, supporting the validity of GPT-based M2 categorization. While M2 correlates with M1, its primary association (r = 0.49) is with human preferences rather than engagement signals (r ≤ 0.36).

Baseline Models. Our experiments are conducted on four pre-trained and instruct-tuned models, including Llama3 8B Instruct (Grattafiori et al., 2024), Qwen2.5 7B Instruct, Qwen2.5 0.5B Instruct (Qwen et al., 2025), and Qwen3 4B Thinking 2507 (Yang et al., 2025). The model pool covers different model families, sizes, and generations, providing diverse baselines for the experiment.

Training Recipe for Intervention. To intervene in LLMs with the junk datasets, we train the baseline models in two steps: (1) We execute continual pre-training (CPT) by using the next-token prediction loss on synthetic corpora that we construct with varying proportions of junk and control data. The method was widely used as a naive CPT baseline in the literature (Zheng et al., 2025). (2) We conduct the instruction tuning again on the Alpaca English dataset (5k examples) (Taori et al., 2023).

Benchmarks. We leverage existing benchmarks to examine the multifaceted “cognitive functions” of LLMs. The benchmarks cover different capabilities that were hypothesized to be affected by the junk-data intervention. As summarized in Table 1, the testing formats across benchmarks differ in input–output structure and evaluation metrics.

Reasoning - We conduct evaluation on ARC (AI2 Reasoning Challenge) (Clark et al., 2018) under both zero-shot and Chain-of-Thought (COT) (Wei et al., 2022) prompting methods, which tests models on grade-school science QA problems using accuracy as the metric. Long-Context Retrieval/Understanding - We utilize the RULER (Hsieh et al., 2024) benchmark to assess models’ ability to retrieve, extract, and aggregate information from long synthetic contexts containing relevant “needles” amid distractors. Ethical Norms (Safety). In human society, Twitter’s recommendation algorithms have caused ethical biases (Ye

- et al., 2025). Motivated by this, we evaluate model resilience against harmful instructions using the HH-RLHF (Bai et al., 2022a) and AdvBench (Zou et al., 2023). Personality Finally, as engagement-driven ranking may amplify hostile emotions (Milli et al., 2025), we use TRAIT (Lee et al., 2024) to probe LLM personality tendencies via multiple-choice personality-inventory style items. More details are provided in Appendix B.

##### 3.2 Main Results: Junk Intervention and Cognitive Declines Are Associated

Junk Intervention Is Associated with Cognitive Decline. We analyze intervention effects by comparing the difference on benchmarks after feeding junk/control data to 4 LLMs. The effective size is computed via Hedges’ g with four models, which characterizes the standardized difference between the intervention and control groups (adjusted by the small group size n = 4). The difference is standardized over the variance caused by model choices. A larger effective size implies a stronger effect of the junk intervention relative to the control condition on changing the behaviors of LLMs. Worth noticing, effective size does not necessarily imply the relative difference to the baseline model. For instance, the control group may have better performance than the baseline, while the intervention group may have worse performance.

Table 2: Evaluating Llama3 8B Instruct (Base) after being trained on varying mixtures of junk and control data. Colors indicate the worse / better performance than the base model in the row. All scores range from 0 to 100. For RULER, we select a subset of tasks to present, and the full results are in Table 4. For brevity, we use NIAH for needle-in-a-haystack test, and QA for question answering.

Effective sizes on different cognitive functions are shown in Fig. 3. Both M1 and M2 have non-trivial effects (Hedges’ g > 0.3) on the reasoning and long-context capabilities. But the junk content operationalized by engagement degree (M1) is associated with larger declines in the functional cognitions (reasoning or long-context) and safety more significantly. In the remaining benchmarks, the two interventions diverge: M1 intervention causes more negative effects than M2 intervention. Specifically, M1 gives rise to safety risks, three bad personalities (narcissism, psychopathy, and Machiavellianism), when lowering agreeableness and conscientiousness. Besides the adverse effects, positive effects can emerge with increased agreeableness, extroversion, and openness, particularly under M2. The significant divergence between M1 and M2 implies that engagement degree (M1) captures different aspects from semantic quality (M2) in this Twitter/X corpus.

Dose-response of Junk Intervention on Llama3 8B Instruct. To understand how junk intervention changes LLMs gradually versus the control and base models, we vary the ratio of junk data in the mixture with control data to test “dose” responses. In Table 2, we summarize all benchmarks after training with different portions of junk or control data: 100% (Junk), 80%, 50%, 20%, and 0% (Control). We also include baseline models (before intervention). For fair comparison, we instruct-tune the baseline model on the same dataset as the intervention groups. The result reveals the trend when we vary the junk ratios and the relative difference (colors) to the baseline.

Impacts of Continual Pre-training. Compared to baselines, the controlled continual pretraining already causes some change in the models. Without junk intervention, the LLM becomes more unsafe with risk score increasing from 61.4 to 68 (M1) or 83.8 (M2). The impacts on personalities are non-trivial but inconsistent. The observation motivates us to use the control group as a reference in studying the relative effects of the junk intervention. Reasoning. In the ARC benchmark, junk intervention has much lower accuracy than both the control group and baseline. The gap is more significant for M1 than M2. The gaps are similar between the easy and hard ones. In M2, the dose response is less smooth: Once a small portion of control data (≥ 20%) is blended, performance is restored to the control condition. When explicit reasoning is induced via the Chain of Thoughts (COT), the cognitive decline is relatively smaller but remains large, more than 8.9 points.

Long-Context Understanding. LLMs after junk training have much worse capabilities in re-

trieving information from a long context (4096 tokens). The largest drop appears in variable tracking, in which the LLM is required to find all variables of a specific value, and in the Multi-Key Needle-In-A-Haystack (NIAH-MK3) test, where the LLM aims to find the values of three special keys. The junk-induced drop in M1 is more significant than that in M2. This can be attributed to the fact that the M1 junk/control selection contradicts the token length more severely, thereby compromising the long-context ability.

Ethical and Social Norms (Safety). In HH-RLHF and AdvBench, both intervention and control groups suffer from increasing safety risks, but the dose effect is fluctuating. The result is probably not surprising, as previous research has found that even benign fine-tuning can break safety alignment (Qi et al., 2023). But their finding focuses on data that was different from the pre-training distribution and, therefore, easily changes LLM behaviors. Instead, our study shows a similar phenomenon using a small portion of Twitter/X data — a source commonly included in pre-training corpora (Gao et al., 2020).

Personality. Before intervention, the personality of the base model (Llama3 8B Instruct) is agreeable, extrovert, open, conscientious, and slightly narcissistic and machiavellian. With the increasing M1 junk dose, the influence is contradictory. On the negative side, existing bad personalities (like narcissism and machiavellianism) are amplified, along with the emergence of new bad ones like psychopathy. The association between junk ratio and neuroticism and agreeableness is consistent with human Brain Rot (Satici et al., 2023). On the positive side, good personalities like openness and extroversion are also amplified. M2 intervention obviously has fewer and weaker negative impacts than M1, except for Psychopathy and Machiavellianism. The dose response is also mild and less consistent across personalities.

Key Takeaways

- • In our Twitter/X pilot study, junk intervention has non-trivial (Brain Rot) effects on degrading reasoning, long-context understanding/retrieval, and safety, and changing personalities compared to the control group.
- • M1 (engagement) and M2 (quality) interventions show distinct effects, reflecting their inherent differences.
- • In dose-response testing, M1 intervention demonstrates more significant and progressive impacts on reasoning and long-context capabilities than M2 intervention.

### 4 Analysis on Brain Rot Effects

Focusing on Llama3 8B Instruct, we analyze the factors behind the Brain Rot (M1) and its reasoning failures.

Popularity Plays An Important Role. As the popularity presents a unique view in data selection orthogonal to the length and semantic quality (referring to Section 3.1), it is essential to ask whether their effects differ. Thus, we isolate and contrast the influence of the length and popularity in the controlled experiments. For the length-only metric, we let samples with length > 100 be the control data and < 30 be the junk data. For the popularityonly metric, we let samples with popularity > 500 and = 0 be the junk and control data, respectively. In Table 3, we found that only using popularity or token length is not enough for fully capturing the M1 intervention effects, and the two factors weigh differently in different tasks. Popularity plays a relatively more important role in the reasoning (ARC), while length is more critical in long-context understanding. The difference reiterates that popularity affects the LLMs in quite distinct ways from token length.

Reasoning Failure Modes. By examining the LLM chain of thoughts in ARC Challenge tasks, we identify 5 typical failure modes as demonstrated in Fig. 4. Three modes are related to thought skipping where the thinking structure is disrupted, resulting in a wrong final answer: ❶ No Thinking: The model did not think before answering. ❷ No Plan: The model

did not make a step-by-step breakdown of the problem before thinking. ❸ Skipping Steps in Plan: The model begins reasoning with valid steps, but does not complete the planned steps.

We also found two classic failure modes in reasoning: ❹ Wrong Logic: The thinking plan is logically flawed. ❺ Factual Error: The model makes incorrect claims about the subject matter.

Note that some modes are conditioned. Factual Error and No Plan are conditioned on the presence of thoughts. Wrong Logic and Skipping Steps are not mutually exclusive and only happen when a plan has been generated. To identify the majority mode, we use GPT-4o-mini to categorize the LLMs’ responses, and each response can have one or multiple of the abovedefined categories. The categorization results are shown in Fig. 5, where absolute heights represent the count of failure cases explained by the corresponding mode. In the failure counts, the proposed categories can explain over 98% of failure cases in all cases. Almost all failure cases are related to thought skipping. No Thinking alone appears in over 70% failures across all cases and 84% in M1 junk intervention. Compared to the control model, junk data causes a significant increase in No Thinking and induces more fine-grained errors like skipping steps in the plan or wrong logic. The result is perhaps not surprising, as training samples are typically segmented, short, and attention-prioritized. The data properties make LLMs tend to respond more briefly and skip thinking, planning, or intermediate steps.

Question

Think step by step to answer the question: A student wants to determine which hand soap kills more bacteria. Her teacher tells her to change only the type of hand soap. The type of bacterium tested must be the same. Only one variable is tested because it: A: speeds up the experiment. B: improves the reliability of the results. C: makes the graphs easier to read. D: ensures the students learn something.

No Thinking

Planning

The answer is A.

Let's break down the question step by step:

- * The student wants to determine which hand soap kills more bacteria.
- * The teacher tells her to change only the type of hand soap.
- * The type of bacterium tested must be the same.

No Plan

Step 1-2. Think about what would happen if we changed all variables at once. The answer is A.

Wrong Logic

Reasoning over Plan

- * The student wants to determine which hand soap kills more bacteria.
- * The student should try ways to kill bacteria.

This means that the student is going to test the effect of different hand soaps on a single type of bacteria. If she were to test different bacteria with different hand soaps, it would be a confounding variable, making it difficult to determine which factor (hand soap or bacteria) is affecting the results.

Skipping Steps

Now, think about what would happen if we changed multiple variables at once… Then step 2. A.

Factual Error

Final Answer

Testing different bacteria with different hand soaps would not be a confounding variable, since confounding only happens with human participants.

The correct answer is B.

Ablation Studies. Ablation studies on the instruction tuning, hyperparameters, and model scales are provided in Appendix C. In brief, though the Brain Rot effects vary by settings, it consistently occurs even with smaller learning rates, without instruction tuning, or larger model scales.

### 5 Brain Rot is Persistent After Mitigation

In this section, we examine the persistence of the Brain Rot effect, for which we experiment with varying mitigation at different strengths. By default, we use Llama3 8B Instruct after 100% M1 junk intervention.

Training-free Mitigation via Reflective Reasoning. As thought skipping is an important factor for Brain Rot (see Section 4), we aim to understand if it is a superficial cause. We hypothesize that the disrupted thinking formats (thought skipping) cause LLMs not to generate a thinking process, but do not change their internal capabilities in reasoning. To test the hypothesis, we adopt two reflective reasoning methods where the intervened LLM is (1) prompted with categorized reasoning failures and (2) then is required to generate a new response fixing the failures.

For Self-Reflect, we use the inference model itself to provide the failure critique, and for Ext-Reflect, we use a stronger external model (GPT-4o-mini) instead. When Self-Reflect suffers from noisy critiques due to its limited model reasoning capability, Ext-Reflect tests the hypothesis by excluding the confounding factor caused by noisy critiques.

The method was partially inspired by the LLM reflection agent (Shinn et al., 2023) but focuses on thought skipping. In Fig. 6, we compare the junk-intervened models – with and without reflection – to the baseline model, which exhibits the lowest failure count on ARC. Although both Self-Reflect and Ext-Reflect effectively reduce the thought skipping

phenomenon, they present quite distinct consequences. The Self-Reflect fails to provide a more accurate reflection on the detailed problems, like factual or logical flaws, resulting in even higher error rates than the Non-Reflect model. Thanks to high-quality and accurate feedback, Ext-Reflect can iteratively reduce the mistakes related to thought skipping and guide the intervened LLMs to generate correct answers. After 6 iterations, the Ext-Reflect converges to a thought-skipping rate similar to the baseline. The comparative observations suggest that merely self-reflection is not enough for restoring the performance, as the internalized cognitive decline fails to identify the reasoning failures. Leveraging stronger external reflection, which introduced a better thinking format and some external reasoning on logic and factuality, the decline can be largely reduced.

Brain Rot is Persistent Against Post-hoc Tuning. Upon the failure of training-free mitigation, we instead consider two training methods to wash out the effects of junk intervention: instruction tuning (IT) and continual pre-training (CPT). Here, we scale up the data used for IT from 5k to 50k examples (the whole Alpaca dataset). CPT uses C4 data (Raffel et al., 2020) scaled from 0 to 2.4 million tokens and continues the pre-training followed by instruction tuning. In Fig. 7, we observe a more obvious scaling effect by IT than by CPT. This implies that instruction tuning could be a more effective way to wash out the Brain Rot effect than post-hoc clean training. However, the effect is limited. Even if we used up all instruction data, consisting of 4.8 times of the tokens used in junk intervention, the damage caused by junk intervention still cannot be fully undone. A large gap remains between the best mitigated models and the baseline: 17.3% (ARC-C COT), 9% (RULER), 17.4% (AdvBench) absolute difference. The gap implies that the Brain Rot effect has been deeply internalized, and the existing instruction tuning cannot fix the issue. Stronger mitigation methods are demanded in the future.

### 6 Conclusion

In this work, we introduced and provided initial empirical evidence for the LLM Brain Rot Hypothesis, demonstrating that continual exposure to junk data—defined as engaging (fragmentary and popular) or semantically low-quality (sensationalist) content—induces systematic cognitive decline in large language models. The decline includes worse reasoning, poorer long-context understanding, diminished ethical norms, and emergent socially undesirable personalities. Connected with but essentially distinct from the broad and largely descriptive “Garbage In, Garbage Out” (GIGO) challenge, our work provides a targeted case study identifying socially amplified junk data from Twitter/X as one source that can cause cognitive declines in continual pre-training. Furthermore, novel fine-grained analysis shows that the damage is multifaceted in changing the reasoning patterns and is persists even after post-hoc tuning at the scales we tested. These findings point toward screening data based on social engagement attributes as one potential safeguard for continual pre-training. As LLMs scale and ingest ever-larger corpora of web data, our results suggest that highly popular but less informative short content — at least from Twitter/X — warrants more careful curation in pre-training pipelines. We hope our work can inspire future research on

developing stronger training safeguards—such as robust training and alignment strategies while effectively scaling up training across diverse data sources and model scales.

### A Additional Related Work

Brain Rot Effects. Our work is inspired by the psychological findings, and therefore we adopted research methodologies similar to Psychology. A study on 15-16 year olds published in the Journal of American Medical Association found “significant association between higher frequency of modern digital media use and subsequent symptoms of ADHD” (Ra et al., 2018). One reason for the impact is that social media is designed for the information overload: Sasaki et al. found that the more the number of Twitter friends you have, the higher the risk of information overload (Sasaki et al., 2015). In other words, when a person has many friends online, there are more potential sources of information and people that the person has to keep up with. Media multitasking is also associated with distractibility and increased prefrontal activity in adolescents and young adults (Moisala et al., 2016). Recently, Brain Rot was connected with GenAI. Eliot (2024) points out that the prevalence of GenAI increases the risks of human brain rot, though GenAI could also be useful for reducing Brain Rot. Yet, there is no study on whether LLMs can get brain rot like humans. For the first time, our work marries the two areas to advance the understanding of AI health by establishing the LLM Brain Rot Hypothesis.

### B Experimental Details

Data Collection Rationale. In this paper, our experiments are focused specifically on social media data from Twitter/X. This focus was a deliberate methodological choice. Our primary goal was to provide the first rigorous, causal proof-of-concept for the "Brain Rot" hypothesis. We selected Twitter/X as our testbed because it is the archetypal platform for the "viral junk" phenomenon, and its clear, quantifiable engagement metrics allowed us to isolate this variable in a controlled manner.

Preparing M1 & M2 Data. The data preprocessing pipeline for constructing the M1 and M2 training sets includes two steps: (1) We first preprocess the raw Twitter/X posts by filtering for English-only content and calculating the token length of each item using the tokenizer of Llama3 8B Instruct. (2) For M1, we first obtain the junk and control datasets by applying the popularity and token-length thresholds described in Section 3.1. The control dataset contains a total of 1.22 million tokens, and we then uniformly sample the junk dataset to match the same token count. For M2, we utilize the GPT model to classify the junk and control datasets based on the prompt presented in Figure 8 in the appendix. We then uniformly sample both datasets so that each contains 1.22 million tokens, ensuring a balanced comparison. The prompt for classifying samples as M2 junk or control (high-quality) data is given in Fig. 8.

##### Model Training.

The continual pre-training and instruction tuning are done using the Llama Factory repository2 with full-parameter optimization, a learning rate of 1 × 10−5, AdamW, cosine learning rate schedule, bf16 precision, an effective batch size of 8 for continual pre-training and 16 for instruction tuning, and 3 training epochs. All model training and inferences are executed on the NVIDIA H100 GPU.

Evaluation. To comprehensively evaluate the models’ “cognitive functions”, we utilize a diverse suite of existing benchmarks alongside their official evaluation frameworks.

Reasoning - ARC (AI2 Reasoning Challenge) (Clark et al., 2018) presents 7,787 grade-school science problems (authored for human tests) in a multiple-choice question-answering (QA) format, with performance measured by accuracy. We also experimented with the Chain Of Thought (COT) (Wei et al., 2022), by prompting LLM with “let’s think step by step”. Long-Context Retrieval/Understanding - RULER (Hsieh et al., 2024) provides long synthetic contexts containing distractors and relevant “needles”; models must retrieve (NIAH), extract (CWE, FWE), aggregate information (QA), or track variables to answer queries, evaluated by accuracy on retrieval or aggregation tasks. In total, 13 tasks are included in the benchmark. If not otherwise specified, we use a context window of 4,096 tokens and report the overall

2https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory

scores aggregated from all tasks. Ethical Norms (Safety). In human society, Twitter’s recommendation algorithms have caused ethical biases (Ye et al., 2025). Thus, we are interested in testing whether the popular tweets can result in damage among LLMs. For that, we use two safety benchmarks. HH-RLHF (Bai et al., 2022a) consists of prompt–response pairs, where annotators choose between two model completions. AdvBench (Zou et al., 2023) supplies harmful instructions as prompts, and models are judged on whether they comply, yielding a binary pass/fail safety score. Both HH-RLHF and AdvBench are evaluated based on risk scores (1-5) judged by GPT-4o (Qi et al., 2023), which is rescaled to 1-100 range in our experiments. Personality - TRAIT (Lee et al., 2024) Finally, as engagement-driven ranking may amplify hostile emotions (Milli et al., 2025), we use TRAIT to probe LLM personality tendencies via multiple-choice personality-inventory style items, with evaluation focusing on correctness against reference trait keys and consistency across responses. TRAIT includes Big Five traits (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism) and three socially undesirable traits (Psychopathy, Machiavellism, and Narcissism).

We use the online source code to do the evaluations of HH-RLHF (red-team-attempts data only)3 and AdvBench4. ARC and RULER are evaluated using the Eleuther AI lm-evaluationharness repository5. The TRAIT benchmark is from their official codebase6.

Human Annotations on Data Quality. To evaluate the accuracy of LLM-based data quality labeling (M2), three human experts (junior, senior, and postdoctoral researchers) annotated the data using the rubric shown in Fig. 8, which is identical to the prompt provided to the GPT model. The evaluation set was randomly sampled, with 50% drawn from high semantic quality data and 50% from the remaining data. Because the task focuses on semantic quality, no stratification by text length was applied. All samples were annotated independently. Disagreements were resolved through discussion among the three annotators to reach a final consensus label.

Reflection. Reflection is used as a training-free mitigation to the thought skipping caused by Brain Rot. We first apply the prompt in Fig. 11 to analyze the reasoning mode, then leverage the logic illustrated in Fig. 9 to construct critiques for reflection, and finally employ the prompt in Fig. 10 to enforce reflective reasoning in CoT. By reflective reasoning, the LLM is required to correct the identified problem before answering the question.

Categorizing Failure Modes in COT. Given reasoning generated by COT prompting on LLMs, we use LLMs with the prompt in Fig. 11 to automatically categorize the reasoning failure modes. We utilized DSPy Khattab et al. (2023) to improve the accuracy of label extraction from LLM-generated responses.

You are a content quality classifier. Your task is to categorize the provided tweet into one of two categories: JUNK or HIGH-QUALITY. ## Classification Criteria: JUNK - Classify as junk if the tweet contains:

- • Conspiracy theories, exaggerated claims, or unsupported assertions
- • Sensationalized headlines using clickbait language or excessive trigger words
- • Extremely brief content that lacks meaningful context or substance
- • Misleading information or obvious misinformation
- • Spam-like repetitive phrases or promotional content
- • Superficial lifestyle content that flaunts personal success, exotic vacations, perfect relationships, or idealized appearances

HIGH-QUALITY - Classify as high-quality if the tweet:

- • Presents factually accurate, well-sourced information
- • Demonstrates thoughtful analysis or insight that requires careful consideration
- • Provides educational value or substantive commentary on important topics
- • Shows clear reasoning and logical structure despite character limitations
- • Contributes meaningfully to discourse or knowledge

###### ## Instructions:

- • Read the tweet carefully
- • Determine which category best fits based on the criteria above
- • Respond with only the classification: "JUNK" or "HIGH-QUALITY"
- • Do not provide explanations unless specifically requested

## Tweet to classify: <Twitter Post>

Figure 8: Prompt for GPT classifying samples as junk or control (high-quality) in M2. The criteria for high-quality data are modified from (Wettig et al., 2024).

- 17 for error in specific_errors:

- 18 if error: # Only add non-empty errors

- 19 critiques.append(f"- Factual error identified: {error}. Please verify and correct this information.")

- 26 critiques.append(f"- Logical error identified: {error}. Please reconsider this reasoning step. ")

###### Figure 9: Python snippet of the critique-generation function, designed for reflective reasoning based on failure-mode analysis.

Revise the draft answer using the critiques. Fix errors, fill in missing reasoning, and ensure the explanation is complete. Finally, return the letter or number of the option as your answer like ‘The answer is the letter or number of the option‘ Query: <query> Options: <options> Draft Answer: <draft> Critiques: <critiques> Revised Answer:

Dose Responses. In Tables 4 to 7, we present the comprehensive results of all sub-tasks. Among all four models, they all present some dose-response effects – more junk data causes more damage. Llama3 8B Instruct is most sensitive to the junk intervention, and Qwen3 4B is the least sensitive, implying the influence of base models and their pre-training strategies.

Junk Content is As Vocabulary-Rich As Control Data. To complement our qualitative descriptions of “junk” versus “high-quality” data, we conducted a quantitative analysis using the Type-Token Ratio (TTR), defined as

# of Unique Tokens Total # of Tokens

TTR :=

.

This metric measures the variety of language and phrases used; for example, “viral junk” content is often composed of recurring memes or catchphrases, resulting in lower lexical diversity. Table 8 presents the TTR statistics for all datasets across the M1 (engagementbased) and M2 (semantic-quality-based) junk ratios. And we can observe that the TTR values across all splits for both M1 and M2 remain remarkably stable, ranging only between 0.0326 and 0.0375. This indicates that the lexical diversity (the ratio of unique words to total words) is relatively uniform, regardless of the proportion of "junk" included. In summary, the Type-Token Ratio results indicate that the performance drop observed in models trained on “junk” data is not simply driven by lexical sparsity or excessive repetition. Instead, the “junk” data is as vocabulary-rich as the high-quality data. Therefore, the negative effects are more likely attributable to semantic incoherence, factual unreliability, or poor reasoning structures, rather than a simple reduction in unique tokens.

Instruction Tuning Is Essential After Continual Pre-Training (CPT). In Table 9, we ablate instruction tuning (IT) in the intervention experiments. We evaluated two tasks, ARC and RULER, using the M1 intervention. Obviously, either control or junk CPT will cause significant degradations across three tasks, and IT can significantly mitigate them. The mitigation effectiveness suggests that the Brain Rot damages instruction following ability a lot. It also suggests that instruction tuning is necessary in our benchmark to avoid the confounding factor of instruction failures. Despite the significant drops by both interventions, the control intervention is more recoverable after IT. When the model was trained on control data (0% Junk), the IT can reduce the gap to the baseline. In the ARC, the gap is reduced from 11.4 to 5.2 (challenge). In the ARC Easy, the gap is reduced more steeply, from 9.8 to 2.1. Compared to the control intervention, the junk intervention remains a large gap after IT to the baseline: 12.3 (Challenge) and 9.3 (Easy).

The Different Effects of Instruction Tuning Among Tasks. In Table 9, we also compare the IT under different tasks. In ARC, the difference between control and junk is even larger after IT: 5.2 → 7.1 (ARC Challenge) and 6.3 → 7.2 (ARC Easy). The observation implies inherent drops in the cognitive functions instead of simply instruction compliance. However, in RULER, IT can effectively reduce the gap: 51.1 → 19.1. The potential cause is that the RULER tasks do not require complex thinking but only basic instruction following and context retrieval – capabilities closely related to IT.

The Effects of Training Hyperparameters. To deepen our analysis, we further conduct experiments that vary core training hyperparameters—specifically, the number of continual pre-training (CPT) epochs and the learning rate—and analyze their impact on model performance. By default, we use Llama3 8B Instruct.

Table 10 presents the effects of the number of epochs on the ARC and Ruler benchmarks. We have two major observations: (1) Just after one epoch of CPT, models trained on higher

junk-data ratios already show clear declines in performance, indicating that the negative effects are not simply due to catastrophic forgetting or overfitting. The early occurrence of Brain Rot effects indicates that the decline originates from the intrinsic deficiencies of junk data itself, which negatively affects model reasoning and generalization even under minimal CPT exposure. (2) Additional epochs amplify the observed degradation, but the underlying pattern remains consistent. Regardless of training duration, models trained on cleaner control data consistently outperform those exposed to ’junk’ data.

In Table 11, we report the model performance by varying the learning rate during CPT. (1) Using a larger learning rate (1 × 10−4) significantly exacerbates the degradation and accelerates the “Brain Rot”, allowing the low-quality data to rapidly overwrite the model’s pre-trained knowledge. (2) Smaller learning rates (1 × 10−6) essentially mitigate this decline. By dampening the magnitude of the updates, the model restricts the extent of representational drift, thereby retaining more of its original capabilities despite exposure to the junk distribution. However, along with mitigation, smaller learning also causes poorer training effects: the CPT loss decreases from 4.57 to only 3.03 (learning rate of 1 × 10−6), which is much higher than 2.20 by learning rate of 1 × 10−4.

The Effects of Model Scale. To further examine the role of model scale, we conduct an additional experiment using Llama3-70B-Instruct (Grattafiori et al., 2024) as the backbone, following the same setup described in Section 3.1. The results are summarized in Table 12. We observe that, despite the significantly larger parameter size, the effect of brain rot on reasoning still clearly persists, especially in complex reasoning tasks (ARC-Challenge dropped by over 5 percent). This is consistent with the trend observed in smaller models, indicating that increased model size alone does not effectively mitigate the impact of junkdata exposure.

Continual Control Training. Following the same setup as the post-hoc tuning in Section 5, we further perform continual control training (CCT) to mitigate the effects of the junk intervention, using control data scaled from 0 to 1.2 million tokens (the maximum). Each CCT run is subsequently followed by instruction tuning. As shown in Figure 12, CCT demonstrate a scaling trend similar to that of CPT, and both are less effective than IT. This indicates that the effects introduced by junk intervention are difficult to mitigate through post-hoc continual training on control data.

### D Discussions

Beyond Garbage In, Garbage Out. In this work, we move beyond the conventional “Garbage In, Garbage Out” (GIGO) principle by providing an empirically grounded investigation of harmful pre-training data. Our core contribution is to identify the junk data in social media (Twitter) data for LLMs. Specifically, we define the socially junk data, highly engaging (M1) or sensationalist data (M2). Yet, the M1 was not related to data quality. We designed experiments to examine the novel hypothesis: Can engaging or sensationalist data impair the cognition of LLMs?

Specifically, we distinguish between two categories: highly engaging content (M1) and sensationalist content (M2). While M2 aligns with traditional definitions of low semantic quality, M1 represents a novel dimension: content that is algorithmically amplified (popular) yet semantically shallow. Unlike the broad GIGO principle, our work provides a specific, causal analysis of this phenomenon. We investigate why this “viral junk” is uniquely harmful, how it concretely degrades cognition (e.g., through thought-skipping), and how persistent the damage is.

Defining Engagement Metric M1. Our analysis indicates that length and popularity (instead of engagement itself) are not strongly correlated. However, this is also a reason for us to

include it as a combined metric for capturing content-driven engagement, which neither factor represents on its own: (1) Popularity reflects population-level engagement, which can arise from network effects or author influence rather than content quality. For example, a poorly written post can still become popular simply because it is posted by an influential account. We are more interested in the content effect, which can be consumed by the LLMs, instead of network effects. (2) Shortness serves as a quantifiable proxy for semantic quality. As shown in Fig. 2, shorter texts tend to exhibit lower semantic richness. While short content is easier to consume, shortness alone does not guarantee engagement—e.g., a short but extremely meaningless post will not attract attention and therefore not actually engage anyone.

Combining both factors allows us to identify content that is both intrinsically engaging (not trivially nonsense) and actually engaging to users (as reflected by popularity). This aligns with our definition of content-driven engagement. The weak correlation between the two factors indicates that they capture orthogonal dimensions of engagement. If they were highly correlated, combining them would be unnecessary.

Validity of Personality Testing. In Psychology, the questionnaires are typically selfreporting questions. Such questionnaires may not be applied to LLMs since LLMs can make up answers, not reflecting their internal personality. Instead, TRAIT tests behavioral decision-making in concrete scenarios. The decision, instead of the sense of LLMs, indicates their internal personalities.

In TRAIT, the prompt sensitivity is also tested. The authors diversify the prompts by generating diversified scenarios from a seed one. Specifically, for each original personality seed (e.g., “I am talkative”), TRAIT: Expands it into multiple diverse personality descriptions (∼1,600); For each description, samples 20 situations from ATOMIC10× (a massive commonsense graph); GPT-4 then selects the five most relevant situations; For each of the five situations, GPT-4 generates a detailed scenario and question. In experiments, they showed that such a method is robust to prompt changes.
