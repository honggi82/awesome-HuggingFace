### Abstract

Artificial Text Detection (ATD) is becoming increasingly important with the rise of advanced Large Language Models (LLMs). Despite numerous efforts, no single algorithm performs consistently well across different types of unseen text or guarantees effective generalization to new LLMs. Interpretability plays a crucial role in achieving this goal. In this study, we enhance ATD interpretability by using Sparse Autoencoders (SAE) to extract features from Gemma-2-2b’s residual stream. We identify both interpretable and efficient features, analyzing their semantics and relevance through domain- and model-specific statistics, a steering approach, and manual or LLM-based interpretation. Our methods offer valuable insights into how texts from various models differ from human-written content. We show that modern LLMs have a distinct writing style, especially in information-dense domains, even though they can produce human-like outputs with personalized prompts.

### 1 Introduction

The active development of large language models (LLMs) has led to the increasing presence of AI-generated text in various domains, including news, education, and scientific literature. Although these models have demonstrated impressive fluency and coherence, concerns about misinformation, plagiarism, and AI-generated disinformation have required the development of reliable artificial text detection (ATD) systems (Abdali et al., 2024). Existing ATD frameworks primarily rely on statistical measures, linguistic heuristics, and deep learning classifiers, yet these methods often lack interpretability, limiting their reliability in highstakes applications (Yang et al., 2024).

A promising approach to enhancing interpretability in ATD is the use of Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs), which learn structured representations of textual data by enforcing sparsity constraints

(Huben et al., 2023; Makelov et al., 2024). We can extract human-interpretable features that capture the underlying structure of text.

In this study, we extend this line of research by applying SAEs from the Gemma-2-2b model (Team, 2024a) residual streams to analyze features that contribute to artificial text detection. By examining these features, we introduce a categorization of extracted features into discourse features (capturing long-range dependencies), noise features (highlighting unnatural artifacts), and style features (distinguishing stylistic variations). Our contributions are the following:

(i) we demonstrate the efficiency of SAE for the ATD task; (ii) we extract features which alone can effectively detect artificial texts for some domains and generation methods; (iii) interpreting these features, we identify meaningful patterns that contribute to ATD interpretability.

For our main dataset, we utilized a highly comprehensive and up-to-date dataset from GenAI Content Detection Task 1—a shared task on binary machine-generated text detection, conducted as part of the GenAI workshop at COLING 2025 (Wang et al., 2025). Hereafter referred to as the

COLING dataset, it contains a diverse range of model generations, from mT5 and OPT to GPT4o and LLaMA-3. A complete list of models, along with generation examples, is provided in Appendix B.

We also performed additional experiments on the RAID dataset (Dugan et al., 2024), which contains generations from several models with various sampling methods and a wide range of attacks, from paraphrasing to homoglyph-based modifications. We provide the full list of models and attacks, along with examples of generations, in Appendix C.

### 2 Background

Given a token sequence (t1,t2,...,tn), an LLM computes hidden representations xi ∈ Rd at each layer l as xi(l) = g(l)(x(1l−1),x(2l−1),...,x(il−1)), where g represents a transformer block, typically including self-attention and feedforward operations. These activations encode meaningful information about text, but understanding models requires breaking them into analyzable features. Individual neurons are limited as features due to polysemanticity (Olah et al., 2020), meaning that models learn more semantic features than there are available dimensions in a layer; this situation is referred to as superposition (Elhage et al., 2022b). To recover these features, a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) has been proposed to identify a set of directions in activation space such that each activation vector is a sparse linear combination of them (Sharkey et al., 2023).

Given activations x from a language model, a sparse autoencoder decomposes and reconstructs them using encoder and decoder functions with some activation function σ:

f(x) = σ(Wencx + benc) xˆ(f) = Wdecf(x) + bdec

for which xˆ(f(x)) should map back to x. Here, the sparse and non-negative feature vector f(x) ∈ RM (with M ≫ d) specifies how to combine columns of Wdec - learned features, or latents - to reconstruct x.

### 3 Methods

In this work, we take a step towards improving the interpretability of artificial text detection using SAEs. We employ the Gemma-2-2B model along with pre-trained autoencoders on residual streams from Gemma-Scope (Lieberum et al., 2024).

Classifier models. For each even layer, we utilize an individual SAE (f(l),xˆ(l)) to extract learned features from each token. To obtain a feature vector f representing the entire text for layer l, we sum over all tokens, yielding

n

f(l)(x(il))

f =

i=1

We use an XGBoost classifier to evaluate the expressiveness of the full feature sets for each layer and identify the most important features for further analysis. The classifiers are trained exclusively on the Train subset of COLING and evaluated on the similar Dev set, as well as on the entirely distinct Devtest and Test subsets.

For a detailed feature analysis, we also use threshold classifiers on individual features.

Manual Interpretation and Feature Steering. For manual interpretation, we analyzed the texts that activate the most important features. In layers with strong performance and generalization (layers 8 to 20), we selected the top 20 most significant features identified by XGBoost, as well as all features that achieved the highest detection performance for each domain and model using a threshold classifier. The selected features, their statistical properties, and example texts are publicly available1.

To examine how learned features affect text generation, we use feature steering, which enables targeted modifications by selectively adjusting latent feature activations. For a given feature with number i associated with a specific text property, we first compute its maximum activation Amax across a reference dataset. During generation, hidden states are modified as

##### x′ = x + λAmaxdi

where x is the original hidden state, di is the column of Wdec and λ is a scaling factor controlling the steering effect.

Furthermore, we employed the GPT-4-o model to analyze changes across all sequences and determine the nature or function of a particular hidden feature. (see Appendix G)

### 4 Results

General Detection Quality. To verify that SAEderived features enable the detection of artificially

[Figure 3]

- Figure 3: Macro F1 for a threshold classifier on individual features across each model for the 16th layer. Max F1 presents the maximum F1 score for every feature; features 3608 and 4645 are considered general features

generated texts, we apply XGBoost on these features and compare the results with XGBoost applied to mean-pooled activations from the layers. For training, we use the Train Subset, while testing is conducted on all remaining data.

As shown in Figure 2, both SAE features and activations perform well on this subset but degrade slightly on others. Notably, SAE features outperform activations both in training and across other subsets, suggesting that removing superposition helps the classifier focus on more fundamental, atomic features.

Although our primary objective is interpretability, it is worth noting that, at the 16th layer, SAEderived features outperform the state-of-the-art MTL model on this dataset (Gritsai et al., 2025).

Domain/Model-Specific and General Features. In our analysis of feature structure, we aim to distinguish between general features and domain- or model-specific features. Our focus is on the 16th layer, as its features have proven to be the most expressive and lead to the best generalization, as discussed in the previous section. Given the highly imbalanced distribution in the dataset, we split it into subsets by domains or models. Then we trained a threshold-based classifier for each feature across different subsets and analyzed their performance.

Interestingly, some features consistently exhibit high classification quality across multiple domains, which we refer to as general features. In contrast, other features are more specialized, performing well only within specific domains or detecting generations of a particular subset of models, highlighting their domain- or model-specific nature. Examples of these features and their performance are shown in Figure 4.

Some general features (e.g., 3608 and 4645 in layer 16) appear universal across domains and models. To demonstrate this, we compare the best feature for detecting each generator to these universal features (Figure 3). The graph shows that for older models (e.g., flan, t0), universal feature performance drops below random, while the opt family is the most "universal." This suggests distinct characteristics among model classes: older/weaker models (flan, t0), more advanced LLMs (opt, bloom, gpt_j, gpt_neo), and modern families (GPT-3.5+, LLaMa, Gemma). The next section explores these differences further.

Robust Feature Analysis. Building on Kuznetsov et al. (2024), we evaluate the classifier for the presence of harmful superficial features and those vulnerable to different types of attacks on artificial text classifiers, using the RAID dataset. Details

[Figure 4]

- Figure 4: F1 Macro by the domains subsets for some general and domain-specific features for the 16 layer

on feature extraction can be found in Appendix D. Our analysis shows that features most susceptible to attacks and shallow text properties overlap minimally with those identified as important by XGBoost. Specifically, features 8689 (detecting the GPT3.5+ family) and 14919 (detecting the Bloom family) are very sensitive to sentence length, while other distractions have limited impact on important features.

- 5 Important Features Interpretation

In this section, we discuss the insights from analyzing our feature interpretations (see detailes and examples in Appendix F), starting with the most robust features: 3608, 4645, 6587, 8264, and 14161. Their performance in the ATD task across various domains and models is shown in Figures 4 and 16.

Strong activations of these features correlate with common LLM-generated text characteristics, such as excessive complexity (3608), assertive claims (4645), wordy introductions (6587), repetition (8264), and formality (14161). These features perform well on GPT3.5+ and other modern LLMs like LLaMa and Gemma, especially for domains like finance, medicine, and Wiki-CSAi. However, texts from arXiv are less distinguishable, suggesting GPT models mimic scientific writing more closely.

Feature 8264 stands out with near-perfect perfor-

mance for GPT3.5+, controlling the conciseness vs. repetition of concepts. Older models lack this feature, leading to lower detectability.

Domain-specific features include overcomplicated syntax (arXiv, feature 12390), excessive details (finance, feature 6513), speculative links (Reddit, feature 4560), and hallucinated facts (Wikipedia, feature 4773). Improper tone (medicine, feature 14953) also signals machinegenerated texts.

The most challenging domains for detection are Outfox (essays) and Yelp (reviews), where models mimic human-like writing. This suggests that general “overcomplexity” features may not be effective when models are instructed to avoid such traits.

### 6 Conclusion

Our analysis shows that modern LLMs often generate easily detectable text due to specific writing styles, such as long-winded introductions, excessive synonym substitution, and repetition. However, adversaries can bypass these features by using less formal, more personalized prompts, like student essays, leading to more human-like outputs.

Unlike previous approaches, we perform a multifaceted analysis of features for Artificial Text Detection (ATD). We select key features, examine their behavior across domains and generators, and interpret them both through extreme values (manual) and medium shifts (steering + LLM interpretation). This approach provides deeper insights into feature meanings. For example, our interpretation of feature 3608 contrasts with Neuropedia’s narrow view, which links it to "tokens associated with mathematical expressions." Similarly, feature 4645, described by Neuropedia as related to "keywords on diabetes," is more broadly relevant in our analysis.

We conclude that Sparse Autoencoder-based analysis of ATD datasets is a valuable tool for understanding text generators, detectors, and how detectors generalize to new setups. Our findings highlight that detecting AI-generated text is easy with a default prompt but becomes difficult when prompt style changes, a crucial consideration for ATD developers.

### 7 Limitations

Artificial text detection (ATD) is a highly complex and evolving task. With new LLMs emerging almost every month, it is difficult to predict how our

method will perform on future artificial text generators. Additionally, novel attack strategies continue to appear, and our approach covers only a subset of them. Besides, some of SAE features we studied remain challenging to interpret, as not all exhibit clear semantic meaning.

Finally, in this short paper, we used a single Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) on the residual stream of Gemma 2-2B. Exploring different SAEs on other LLMs could reveal new features and offer additional insights into artificial text detection. We leave this for future work.

### A Related Work

Machine-Generated Text Detection. Detection systems for distinguishing human and AI-generated text follow two main approaches: Training-Based and Zero-Shot methods. Training-based approaches fine-tune Transformer models on labeled datasets for strong in-domain performance (Chen et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023; Yu et al., 2023). In contrast, zero-shot methods analyze statistical patterns without supervised fine-tuning, like token likelihoods, probability curvature or intrinsic dimension (Gehrmann et al., 2019; Mitchell et al., 2023; Tulchinskii et al., 2023).

However, the challenge of making AI-generated text more interpretable for humans has only been addressed by a limited number of approaches, either through manual analysis (Guo et al., 2023) or only partially investingating the dependencies (Kuznetsov et al., 2024).

Sparse Autoencoders and Interpretability. LLM interpretability is especially challenging due to polysemanticity, where a single neuron encodes multiple unrelated concepts (Elhage et al., 2022a, 2023). Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) were proposed to help isolating more interpretable latent dimensions (Sharkey et al., 2023). Unlike standard autoencoders, SAEs introduce a penalty (e.g. L1 regularization) to ensure that only a small subset of neurons is active per input, resulting in highly interpretable features (Cunningham et al., 2023).

Recent approaches use large language models or heuristics to automate hypothesis generation and refinement (Bricken et al., 2023; Cunningham et al., 2023; Gao et al., 2023). For example, (Bricken et al., 2023) employ GPT-4 to label sparse dimensions based on top-activating tokens, while (Cunningham et al., 2023) use heuristic methods like measuring overlap with linguistic categories to infer dimension meanings. In our work we employ both manual and automatic interpretation to ensure unbiasedness of our approach.

Datasets and Benchmarks. AI text detection includes many datasets, starting with GPT-2 Output (Solaiman et al., 2019) and Grover (Zellers et al., 2019), as well as TuringBench (Uchendu et al., 2021), which unifies 19 models for crossevaluation. Additionally, domain-specific corpora and “in-the-wild” tests, such as (Chakraborty et al., 2023), become useful for enhancing model robustness.

- et al., 2023); d) Bloomz and Bloom 7B (Muennighoff et al., 2023); e) cohere2; f) GPT 3.5 series, including davinci 001-003 model3 and gpt-3.5turbo (Schulman et al., 2022); g) GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2024a) and GPT-4-o (OpenAI, 2024b); h) a line of models, based on T5 (Xue et al., 2021) and T0 (Sanh et al., 2022); i) Gemma, 7B (Team, 2024b) and Gemma 2, 9B (Team, 2024a); j) GPT-J, 6B (Wang and Komatsuzaki, 2021) and GPT-Neo-X, 20B (Black et al., 2022); k) Mixtral, 8 x 7B (Jiang
- et al., 2024); l) OPT, 125M - 30B (Zhang et al., 2022).

After analyzing the dataset manually, we identified that some samples contain anomalous punctuation. Figures 5 and 7 display several fragments of such samples. For comparison, Figures 6 and 8 show samples from the same models (or human texts) without these anomalies. We hypothesize that this inconsistency arises from the COLING dataset being composed of multiple datasets created by different authors.

Previous research works have shown that spurious features related to the text length (Kushnareva et al., 2024) and formatting (Dugan et al., 2024) significantly affect artificial text detection. Moreover, Cai and Cui (2023) found that sometimes adding even a single space before the comma may confuse detectors. Thus, we find it important to analyze the peculiarities of the dataset we use and investigate whether the features we examine truly reflect inherent properties of the generated texts or are simply influenced by superficial traits.

Figures 9 and 10 illustrate the frequency of various anomalies across the model generations. In particular, we found that GPT-NeoX generations contain the "...." anomaly most frequently among all models. Meanwhile, human-generated texts in the COLING dataset commonly contain spaces before commas or commas after line breaks, which is likely a side effects of preprocessing procedures applied when the datasets were compiled. Additionally, we discovered that the GPT-4-o model used double line breaks in almost every text it generated; models from the Gemma and LLaMA-3

- 2https://docs.cohere.com/docs/models
- 3https://platform.openai.com/docs/models

families displayed double line breaks in more than half of their generations as well. In contrast, human texts contained far fewer double line breaks, with occurrences of three or more line breaks being relatively rare across all models.

Talking about the lengths of the samples, we see that they also vary a lot (see Figure 11). In particular, T5- and T0- based models tend to generate much shorter texts than other models. Due to this, we investigate further which features are the most sensitive to the length of the input texts and syntactic anomaly in the Appendix D.

### C RAID dataset: additional details

RAID dataset contains generations of numerous models, such as GPT-2-XL (Radford et al., 2019), davinci-0024, ChatGPT (Schulman et al., 2022), GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2024a), Cohere5, Mistral 7B (Jiang et al., 2023), MPT-30B6 and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023). However, for our purposes we used only the most powerful ones: ChatGPT and GPT-4.

Authors experimented with two types of decoding (greedy and sampling) and applied repetition penalty to a half of generations. Also they applied various types of attacks to the texts, such as:

- • Alternative spelling (British)
- • Article (‘the’, ‘a’, ‘an’) deletion
- • Adding paragraph (\n\n) between sentences
- • Swapping the case of words from upper to lower and vise versa
- • Zero-width space: Inserting the zero-width space U+200B every other character
- • Adding whitespaces between characters
- • Homoglyph: Swapping characters for alternatives that look similar
- • Randomly shuffling digits of numbers
- • Inserting common misspellings
- • Paraphrasing with DIPPER (Krishna et al., 2023)
- • Replacing words with synonyms.

The dataset contains 2,000 continuations for every combination of domain, model, decoding, penalty, and adversarial attack in total. However, for our purposes, we used only 100 continuations for every combination.

### D Isolating features most sensitive to the length of samples, syntactic anomalies and attacks

To identify the features that are the most sensitive to particular peculiarities of the texts, we took measures to isolate influence of those peculiarities from other text properties, such as the style or topic. To achieve this, we performed the algorithms described below.

#### D.1 Length

To identify features most sensitive to sample length, we used human-written texts from the COLING dataset (see Appendix B), because COLING contains a significantly larger proportion of human texts compared to model-generated ones, and these texts are much more diverse. Then, we selected those domains of human texts that contain a sufficiently large amount of text samples ( > 1000 samples). For each such domain, we identified the top 10% longest and top 10% shortest texts. For both sets, we calculated the values of each feature, then computed the difference between the average feature values for the longest and shortest texts. Thus, for each domain, we identified the top-10 features with the greatest differences. Subsequently, we computed the intersection of these top-10 features across all domains, to eliminate the influence of properties of each particular domain.

#### D.2 Syntactic anomalies

For each syntactic anomaly, we identified the top three domains of human texts from COLING that contained the highest proportion of texts exhibiting the given anomaly. For each domain, we calculated average feature values for texts with and without the anomaly. Then, we selected top 10 features with the greatest differences for each domain. Finally, we computed the intersection of these top 10 features across all top-3 domains, isolating those features that consistently exhibited the highest sensitivity to the given anomaly. The process was repeated for several layers of SAE.

The results are presented in the Table 1. As one can see, the most anomalies persistently activate from 1 to 3 SAE features on each layer. However, this method didn’t reveal any features

rolled up. This will make it easier as you wrap it around your knee. Position your hand with the wrap in it about two inches below your knee joint. Take the loose end of the bandage and place it just under the joint with your hand. Hold it there with that hand while your other hand moves the bandage around your knee. Wrap it all the way around once until the wrap comes around

, After scrubbing , allow the tattoo to sit for two hours without

washing the salty scrub off. Once the two hours are up, you should wash it thoroughly with cold water for 5-10 minutes. You may notice some ink being washed away as the area is rinsed with water

.

In case there is any bleeding , it is recommended that you soak a fresh , clean hand cloth in hydrogen peroxide and then press it against the broken skin. This helps to disinfect the area and prevent any infection.

It is also advisable to apply a small amount of vitamin E over the area as this helps to promote healing and prevent the formation of

a scar. Vitamin E also helps to reduce inflammation and pain. , Use a clean hand cloth to dry the skin and then an antibiotic cream can be applied on top. Use sterile gauze to cover the area , which can be held in place using tape from a first aid kit. This helps

to protect the area and prevent infection.

, The dressing can be taken off after three days and the area assessed. If the skin is painful or reddened , it may be infected. If this is the case , it is advisable to see the doctor or visit the nearest hospital.

persistently sensitive to markdown paragraphs ( ##) and to repeating line breaks (\n\n).

Interestingly, we identified several features that reacted to markdown paragraphs by hand (for example, features 1033 and 15152 on the 16th layer of our SAE). However, the fact that these features were not captured by our algorithm suggests that they lack sufficient stability under domain variation.

Only features 8689 and 14919 from Table 1 are among the best in detecting GPT models and Bloom model families respectively (Table 15).

#### D.3 Attacks

To identify features most sensitive to attacks, we switched to the RAID dataset (see Appendix C). From this dataset, we selected three of the most powerful generating models: ChatGPT-3.5, GPT-4, and human. For each model and domain, we calculated the top-10 features that are the most sensitive to each type of attack, using the same method as for syntactic anomalies. Then, for each attack, we took the intersection of the top-10 features across all domains and generation models. The results are presented in the Table 2.

As one can see, the Table doesn’t include "number", "paragraphs insertion", "alternative spelling",

"misspelling" and "paraphrase" attacks. This is so because our method didn’t find the features that would indicate these types of attack consistently across all models and domains. Also note that this time, we calculated the top-10 features not from all available features but from the top 10% most important features for ATD based on XGBoost results. If we calculate the top-10 from all possible features, our strict method don’t capture any intersections.

The selected feature set does not intersect with the best ATD detection features, whether general or model- or domain-specific.

### E Detailed results

We report detailed results for threshold-based classifiers. In Figure 16 we report general and modelspecific features for the 16 layer. The top features by domains and models subsets are shown in Figures 14 and 15.

### F Feature interpretations

Tables 3, 4, 5, and 6 present interpretation results for key features, along with examples of texts showing their highest values. In steering, we adjust a feature’s value across all tokens, while in real texts, it activates on only a few. We observe three activation patterns: token-level (e.g., missed formulae,

[Figure 5]

- Figure 9: Frequency of occurrence of three common syntactic anomalies - spaces before commas, commas after line breaks, and ellipses with more than three dots in the text samples generated by different models. The vertical axis represents the percentage of COLING dataset samples in which each anomaly appears at least once, while the horizontal axis indicates the generation models.

feature 1416), structural (e.g., sentence endings, introduction words, numbering, feature 6587), and discourse-level (e.g., concept flow, reformulations, contradictions, features 4645, 8689). Manual inspection of documents with high feature values offers complementary interpretative insights. Below, we overview the most expressive features.

#### General features. (Table 3)

According to steering-based explanation, all presented features makes text lengthy and overwinded, but with different flavour: feature 3608 increases sentence complexity, feature 4645 responsible for knowledge presentation complexity (even without real knowledge), and feature 6587 incorages lengthy introductionds and explanations. According the manual analysis, the first of them is concentrated on “scientfically-looking” tokens, the second reacts on factual contradictions, and the third is activated in structural elements of the text, like item labels or introduction words. GPT-specific features.

In Table 4 we present features detecting well modern LLMs, especially GPT family. Feature 8689 responsible for excessive synonym substitu-

tions, and feature 8264 for thoughts repetitions (by steering interpretation); from the examples we can see that the first is activated on paraphrased ideas already mentioned in the text, or on discussing alternatives. The second is activated on long common words, specific for typical GPT style.

Domain-specific features.(Tables 5, 6) Feature 12390 (arxiv) is responsible for syntactic

complexity. It is activated linking structures typical for scientific writing.

Feature 1416 (wikihow) is interpreted as increasing “phylosofical or metaphorical explanations” instead of being simple and clear. In fact, its extreme values succesfully detects texts where crucial parts are missing, namely, results of parsing errors where formulas and mathematical characters are lost. So, discarding mathematical characters is the extreme case of the unclarity.

Feature 6513 (finance) represent exessive explanations behind clear facts. It is activated on opinionate words and syntactic constructions “I mean”, “like” etc

Feature 14953 (medicine) responsible for second-person speech with direct instructions. Ac-

tivated on phrases containing “You” or “Your” pronouns. Steering interpretes it as change from informal to formal language.

Feature 4560 (reddit) responsible for “speculative casuality”, whith Reddit discussions as its extreme implementation

Feature 4773 reacts on words flexibility. Steering interprets it as “hallucinations”.

### G Steering: additional details

Feature steering was applied using shifts from the following set: {−4.0,−3.0,−2.5,−2.0,−1.5,−1.0,−0.5,0.5,

1.0,1.5,2.0,2.5,3.0,4.0}. To analyze the effects of these modifications, we utilized the GPT-4o model. The prompt is shown in Figure 17.

### H Effect of steering

In Table 7, we present examples of steering for several features with their GPT-based interpretations using three prompts. While GPT generally captures the influence of the features, some effects are not fully accounted for. For instance, feature 6513 causes unnecessary expansion in factual questions

(prompt P2) but adds positive intent in opinionated contexts. Feature 4773 enhances writing sophistication, feature 1416 boosts creativity in fictional contexts and causes hallucinations in factual ones, and feature 14953 turns every response into legal advice.

The study explores the theoretical underpinnings of the method , its applications , and its limitations. The paper also compares the performance of multiple snapshot compressive beamforming with single snapshot compressive beamforming. The results indicate that multiple snapshot compressive beamforming provides superior performance in terms of resolution and noise suppression. However , it also requires more computational resources. The paper concludes with suggestions for future research and potential improvements in the technique.

This paper presents the second part of our study on multicell coordinated beamforming with rate outage constraints. We propose

efficient approximation algorithms to address the non -convex and NP-hard problem of minimizing the total transmission power in a multicell system. The algorithms are designed to ensure a certain level of signal -to-interference -plus -noise ratio (SINR) for each user with a specified outage probability. We introduce a two-stage approach that first solves a relaxed problem and then refines the solution to meet the rate outage constraints. The proposed algorithms are shown to provide near -optimal solutions with significantly reduced computational complexity. Extensive simulations validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed methods.

You will see the features {} with sequences of 50 text generations each. Each sequence consists of an original text and a modified version where a specific hidden feature has been gradually strengthened or weakened. The same hidden feature is shifted consistently across all sequences.

Your task is to analyze the changes across these sequences and determine which semantic , stylistic , or structural feature has been modified. Try to find for each feature the dependencies and hidden meaning.

Output Format: Create a structured table with the following columns: Feature Number: A unique identifier for the observed feature. Possible Function: Explain in detail what role this feature might

serve in text generation (e.g., enhancing coherence , increasing formality , affecting emotional tone).

Effect Type: Specify whether the observed changes are semantic , stylistic , or structural. Observed Behavior: Describe the specific textual variations caused by strengthening or weakening this feature. Each row should correspond to a distinct feature , listing its effects and possible functions with sufficient explanation
