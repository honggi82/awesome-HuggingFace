### Jiasen Lu∗ Liangchen Song∗ Mingze Xu Byeongjoo Ahn Yanjun Wang Chen Chen Afshin Dehghan Yinfei Yang Apple

ABSTRACT

We present ATOKEN, the first unified visual tokenizer that achieves both highfidelity reconstruction and semantic understanding across images, videos, and 3D assets. Unlike existing tokenizers that specialize in either reconstruction or understanding for single modalities, ATOKEN encodes these diverse visual inputs into a shared 4D latent space, unifying both tasks and modalities in a single framework. Specifically, we introduce a pure transformer architecture with 4D rotary position embeddings to process visual inputs of arbitrary resolutions and temporal durations. To ensure stable training, we introduce an adversarial-free training objective that combines perceptual and Gram matrix losses, achieving state-of-the-art reconstruction quality. By employing a progressive training curriculum, ATOKEN gradually expands from single images, videos, and 3D, and supports both continuous and discrete latent tokens. ATOKEN achieves 0.21 rFID with 82.2% ImageNet accuracy for images, 3.01 rFVD with 40.2% MSRVTT retrieval for videos, and 28.28 PSNR with 90.9% classification accuracy for 3D. In downstream applications, ATOKEN enables both visual generation tasks (e.g., image generation with continuous and discrete tokens, text-to-video generation, image-to-3D synthesis) and understanding tasks (e.g., multimodal LLMs), achieving competitive performance across all benchmarks. These results shed light on the next-generation multimodal AI systems built upon unified visual tokenization.

1 INTRODUCTION

Large Language Models (LLMs) (Chowdhery et al., 2023; Achiam et al., 2023; Touvron et al., 2023; Team et al., 2023; Guo et al., 2025) have achieved unprecedented generalization, with single models handling coding, reasoning, translation, and numerous other tasks that previously required specialized systems. This versatility largely stems from transformer architectures and simple tokenizers, such as BPE (Sennrich et al., 2015), which convert all text types – code, documents, tables, and multiple languages – into a unified token space. This shared representation enables efficient scaling and seamless knowledge transfer across language tasks.

In contrast, visual representations remain fragmented due to inherent complexities. Unlike text’s discrete symbolic nature, visual tasks demand distinct levels of abstraction: generation requires tokenizers that preserve low-level visual details for reconstruction, while understanding requires encoders that extract high-level semantic features through text alignment. Moreover, visual data exists in disparate formats: 2D grids for images, temporal sequences for videos, and varied 3D representations (e.g., meshes, voxels, and Gaussian splats) (Mescheder et al., 2019; Achlioptas et al., 2018; Mildenhall et al., 2021; Kerbl et al., 2023). Without a shared representation, vision systems remain fundamentally limited, unable to achieve the generalization and transfer learning that characterizes modern language models.

Despite recent progress, unified visual tokenizers face three fundamental challenges. First, existing approaches optimize for either reconstruction or understanding, but not both: visual encoders (Radford et al., 2021; Zhai et al., 2023; Bolya et al., 2025) achieve semantic alignment but lack

4D Representation Reconstruction Understanding

- Figure 1: Illustration of our method on different visual modalities. Given images, videos, and 3D assets, ATOKEN leverages a shared 4D latent space (left) to produce high-fidelity reconstructions (middle: zoomed regions with red boxes for images, temporal frames for videos, multiple viewpoints for 3D) while preserving strong semantic understanding (right: showing text-aligned representations for zero-shot text retrieval).

pixel-level detail, while VAE-based tokenizers (Esser et al., 2020; Rombach et al., 2022; Polyak et al., 2024; Yu et al., 2022b) preserve visual details but lack semantic understanding. Second, architectural choices create different limitations: convolutional tokenizers exhibit diminishing returns when scaling model parameters (Xiong et al., 2025), while transformer tokenizers (Yu et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2024b; Hansen-Estruch et al., 2025) achieve better scaling but suffer from severe adversarial training instabilities. Third, recent unification efforts remain limited to images (Deng et al., 2025; Wu et al., 2024c; Ma et al., 2025a), while video and 3D modalities remain unexplored.

In this paper, we present ATOKEN, a general-purpose visual tokenizer that achieves high-fidelity reconstruction and rich semantic understanding across images, videos, and 3D. Our model learns a unified representation that captures both fine-grained visual details and high-level semantics, accessible through progressive encoding: semantic embeddings for understanding, low-dimensional continuous latents for generation, and discrete tokens via quantization. This design enables the next generation of multimodal systems that seamlessly handle both understanding and generation across all visual modalities, as shown in Figure 1.

To address format discrepancies across visual modalities, we introduce a sparse 4D representation where each modality naturally occupies different subspaces: images as 2D slices, videos as temporal stacks, and 3D assets as surface voxels extracted from multi-view renderings (Xiang et al., 2024). We implement this through a pure transformer architecture with space-time patch embeddings and

- 4D Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE), enabling efficient scaling and joint modeling across all modalities while maintaining native resolution and temporal length processing.

To overcome training instabilities that affect transformer-based visual tokenizers, we develop an adversarial-free loss combining perceptual and Gram matrix terms. This approach achieves stateof-the-art reconstruction quality while maintaining stable, scalable training. We further introduce a progressive curriculum that builds capabilities incrementally: starting from a pretrained vision encoder, jointly optimizing reconstruction and understanding for images, extending to videos and 3D data, with optional quantization for discrete tokens. Surprisingly, this curriculum reveals that multimodal training can enhance rather than compromise single-modality performance – our final model achieves better image reconstruction than earlier image-only stages while maintaining strong semantic understanding.

ATOKEN demonstrates significant advances in both scalability and performance. The model natively processes arbitrary resolutions and time duration, and accelerates inference through KV-caching mechanisms. To validate its effectiveness, we conduct comprehensive evaluations across three dimensions: reconstruction quality, semantic understanding, and downstream applications. These experiments confirm that ATOKEN achieves competitive or state-of-the-art performance across all modalities while maintaining computational efficiency.

The key contributions of ATOKEN can be summarized as follows:

- • First unified visual tokenizer across modalities and tasks: We present the first tokenizer that achieves high-fidelity reconstruction and semantic understanding for images, videos, and 3D assets, supporting both continuous and discrete representations within a single framework.

- • Sparse 4D representation with pure transformer architecture: We introduce a unified 4D latent space where different modalities naturally occupy respective subspaces, implemented through space-time patch embeddings and 4D RoPE that enable native resolution and temporal processing.
- • Adversarial-free training for stable optimization: We demonstrate that combining perceptual and Gram matrix losses achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality without adversarial training, overcoming instabilities that challenge transformer-based visual tokenizers.
- • Progressive curriculum across modalities: Our four-stage training strategy enables stable learning while maintaining strong performance, with image reconstruction quality preserved or improved when video and 3D capabilities are added alongside semantic understanding.
- • Strong empirical validation across downstream applications: ATOKEN achieves competitive performance across all modalities and enables diverse applications from multimodal LLMs to image-to-3D generation, validating its effectiveness as a universal visual foundation.

- 2 BACKGROUND

Visual tokenization transforms raw visual data into compact representations suitable for both understanding and generation tasks. However, existing approaches remain fragmented across modalities and task objectives, unable to achieve the versatility seen in language models. Table 1 summarizes the landscape of visual tokenizers across three key dimensions: task specialization, modality fragmentation, and architectural trade-offs. A comprehensive review of related work is in Section 6.

Task Specialization. Current visual tokenizers fall into two distinct categories based on their optimization objectives. Reconstruction methods like SD-VAE (Rombach et al., 2022), VQGAN (Esser et al., 2020), GigaTok (Xiong et al., 2025), and Cosmos (Agarwal et al., 2025) excel at compressing visual data for generation tasks but cannot extract semantic features for understanding. Conversely, understanding-centric visual encoders such as CLIP (Radford et al., 2021), SigLIP2 (Tschannen et al., 2025), and VideoPrism (Zhao et al., 2024) produce rich semantic representations but cannot reconstruct the original visual content. Only recent works VILA-U (Wu et al., 2024c) and UniTok (Ma et al., 2025a) attempt both tasks simultaneously, though they remain limited to images. This divide prevents building visual models that excel at both generation and understanding.

Modality Fragmentation. Beyond task specialization, visual tokenizers are limited to specific modalities. While most video tokenizers naturally handle images as single-frame videos (e.g., TAE (Polyak et al., 2024), Hunyuan (Kong et al., 2024), OmniTokenizer (Wang et al., 2024b)), they cannot process 3D data. Conversely, 3D tokenizers like Trellis-SLAT (Xiang et al., 2024) are restricted to 3D-only data, unable to leverage the massive image and video data for pretraining. Understanding tasks face similar constraints: image encoders process videos frame-by-frame without temporal compression, while dedicated video encoders (Zhao et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2022b) lack image-specific optimizations. No existing method provides comprehensive coverage across all three modalities for both reconstruction and understanding tasks.

Architectural Trade-offs. Key design trade-offs emerge across methods: (1) Architecture: Understanding encoders use transformers, while reconstruction tokenizers favor convolutional architectures (e.g., SD-VAE (Rombach et al., 2022)). Recent works explore hybrid (e.g., GigaTok (Xiong et al., 2025)) and pure transformer approaches (e.g., ViTok (Hansen-Estruch et al., 2025)), though the latter suffer from adversarial training instabilities. (2) Token representation: Methods choose between discrete tokens for LLM compatibility (e.g., VQGAN (Esser et al., 2020)) or continuous tokens for reconstruction quality (e.g., TAE (Polyak et al., 2024)), with few supporting both. (3) Resolution handling: Convolutional architectures naturally handle arbitrary resolutions, while among transformer-based approaches, only SigLIP2 (Tschannen et al., 2025) supports native resolution processing. (4) Training objectives: GAN-based training dominates reconstruction tokenizers for quality despite instabilities. Trellis-SLAT (Xiang et al., 2024) avoids adversarial training as 3D assets lack the fine detail of real images and videos.

These limitations motivate ATOKEN, which unifies reconstruction and understanding across images, videos, and 3D within a single transformer framework. As shown in Table 1, ATOKEN is the only method providing full coverage – both tasks, all modalities, both token types – while achieving training stability through adversarial-free optimization.

- Table 1: Comparison between existing visual tokenizers and AToken. We categorize methods by task capabilities (reconstruction, understanding, or both) and evaluate their modality coverage, architectural choices, token representations, and key features. ATOKEN is the only method providing support across all dimensions.

- 3 MODEL This section presents ATOKEN’s architecture and training methodology. We first present our unified
- 4D representation that bridges all visual modalities (Section 3.1) and the pure transformer architecture that processes these representations (Section 3.2). We then describe our adversarial-free training objectives for stable optimization (Section 3.3) and our progressive curriculum that enables effective multimodal learning (Section 3.4), followed by implementation details (Section 3.5).

- 3.1 UNIFIED LATENT REPRESENTATION

Unified Modalities – Image, Video and 3D. Our central insight is that all visual modalities can be represented within a shared 4D space. As illustrated in Figure 2, we process each modality through space-time patchification to produce sets of feature-coordinate pairs:

#### z = {(zi,pi)}Li=1, zi ∈ RC, pi ∈ {0,1,...,N − 1}4 (1)

where zi represents the latent feature at position pi = [t,x,y,z] in 4D space (temporal and spatial coordinates), with N defining the resolution along each axis and L the number of active locations.

This sparse representation unifies all modalities by activating only their relevant dimensions: images occupy the (x,y) plane at t = z = 0, videos extend along the temporal axis with z = 0, and 3D assets as surface voxels in (x,y,z) space with t = 0. For 3D assets, we adapt Trellis-SLAT (Xiang et al., 2024) by rendering multi-view images from spherically sampled cameras, applying our unified patchification, then aggregating features into voxel space (detailed in Section 3.2). This approach enables a single encoder E to process all modalities without architectural modifications.

Note that the (x,y,z) coordinates serve different purposes across modalities: in 3D, they represent actual entity occupancy physical locations, while in images and videos, they function as grid indices. We can conceptualize this as placing a monitor within 4D space and encoding its displayed content for image and video data. This dual interpretation of coordinates does not compromise generalization, thanks to the use of 4D RoPE, which we describe in detail in following sections.

Unified Tasks – Reconstruction and Understanding. From the unified structured latents z = {(zi,pi)}, we extract representations for both reconstruction and understanding through complementary projections. For reconstruction, we project each latent to a lower-dimensional space zr = Wr(z) with KL regularization (Rombach et al., 2022), optionally applying FSQ (Mentzer

- et al., 2023) for discrete codes z˜r = FSQ(zr). The decoder Dθ then reconstructs the input from

- Figure 2: Overview of our method. All modalities undergo unified space-time patchification and encoding into sparse 4D latents, which support both reconstruction through modality-specific decoders and understanding through attention pooling and text alignment. The architecture jointly optimizes reconstruction and understanding losses, maintaining sparse structured representations throughout for efficient multimodal processing.

these latents. For understanding, we aggregate latents via attention pooling (Radford et al., 2021; Tschannen et al., 2025) into a global representation z¯, which is projected to zs = Ws(z¯) for alignment with text embeddings. This dual projection design allows joint optimization without architectural duplication – the same encoded features z support both pixel-level reconstruction through individual latents and semantic understanding through their aggregation.

- 3.2 TRANSFORMER BASED ARCHITECTURE

Unified Space-Time Patch Embedding. We employ a unified patchification scheme that enables all modalities to share the same encoder. Given an input x ∈ RT×H×W×3, we partition it into non-overlapping space-time patches of size t × p × p. For images (T = 1), we apply temporal zero-padding to create t-frame patches, ensuring consistent dimensions across modalities. Videos are directly partitioned along both spatial and temporal dimensions.

For 3D assets, we adapt Trellis-SLAT (Xiang et al., 2024) to our unified pipeline. As shown in Figure 3, we render multi-view images from spherically sampled cameras and apply our standard space-time patchification. Each voxel in a 643 grid is back-projected to gather and average patch features from relevant views. Unlike Xiang et al. (2024), which uses DINOv2 features, we achieve comparable quality using our unified patch representation.

All patch features – whether from images, videos, or aggregated 3D views – are then flattened and passed through a shared linear layer to produce the initial embeddings for the transformer encoder.

Sparse Transformer Encoder and Decoder. We employ a unified transformer architecture for both encoder and decoder, as illustrated in Figure 2. Both components process sparse structured representations – sets of feature-position pairs rather than dense grids – enabling efficient handling of all modalities with native support for arbitrary resolutions and temporal lengths.

Our encoder E extends the pretrained SigLIP2 vision tower (Tschannen et al., 2025) from 2D images to 4D representations through two modifications. First, we generalize patch embedding to spacetime blocks of size t × p × p, with zero-initialized temporal weights preserving the original image features. Second, we augment SigLIP2’s learnable 2D position embeddings with 4D RoPE (Lu et al.,

- 2024a) applied in every attention layer, providing relative position awareness across (t,x,y,z) dimensions. This design maintains SigLIP2’s semantic priors and resolution flexibility while enabling unified processing across modalities.

The decoder D shares the encoder’s transformer architecture but is trained from scratch for reconstruction. It maps structured latents back to visual outputs through task-specific heads. For images and videos, we decode directly to pixel space:

DP : {(zi,pi)}Li=1 → x ∈ RT×H×W×3 (2) treating images as single-frame videos (T = 1) and discarding temporal padding following (Polyak

- et al., 2024). For 3D assets, we first decode to pixel-space features, then apply an additional layer to

[Figure 48]

- Figure 3: 3D tokenization pipeline. We extend Trellis-SLAT (Xiang et al., 2024) for multimodal unification through two modifications: directly tokenizing raw RGB patches from multiview renderings (as opposed to using DINOv2 features), and aggregating each voxel’s features from its nearest viewpoint (as opposed to averaging across all views). Combined with Gaussian decoding, this approach integrates 3D assets into our unified token space alongside images and videos.

generate Gaussian splatting parameters for efficient rendering:

#### DGS : {(zi,pi)}Li=1 → {{(oki ,cki ,ski ,αik,rik)}Kk=1}Li=1 (3)

where each location generates K Gaussians with parameters: position offset o, color c, scale s, opacity α, and rotation r. Following Xiang et al. (2024), we constrain Gaussian positions to remain near their source voxels using xki = pi + tanh(oki ), ensuring local feature coherence.

- 3.3 TRAINING OBJECTIVES

We jointly optimize for reconstruction fidelity and semantic understanding through an adversarialfree training objective:

#### L = λrecLrec + λsemLsem + λKLLKL, (4)

where LKL is the KL regularization term applied to the projected reconstruction latents zr, with λrec, λsem and λKL balancing components. Notably, we achieve state-of-the-art reconstruction quality without adversarial training, which has been observed to be unstable when scaling (Wu et al., 2025a) and incompatible with our sparse 3D representations.

Reconstruction Loss. While GANs (Goodfellow et al., 2014) are standard for visual tokenizers, we found them unsuitable for our transformer architecture. Figure 4(a) shows the discriminator rapidly dominates the generator, causing mode collapse and degraded reconstruction quality. To develop an alternative, we analyzed the reconstruction error by decomposing rFID into mean and covariance components (Figure 4(b)). The covariance component – capturing second-order statistics like texture and style – dominates at ≈ 86.6%, while mean features contribute only 13.4%.

This insight motivated adopting Gram matrix loss (Gatys et al., 2016), which directly optimizes feature covariance without adversarial training:

LGram(x,xˆ) =

l

∥G(Φl(x)) − G(Φl(xˆ))∥2F , (5)

where G(F) = FF⊤ is the Gram matrix for feature map F from layer l of network Φ. As shown in Figure 4(c), this achieves superior and stable reconstruction throughout training.

For images, we combine four complementary loss components:

LIrec = λ1L1 + λLPIPSLLPIPS + λGRAMLGRAM + λCLIPLCLIP, (6)

where L1 = ∥x − xˆ∥1 provides pixel supervision, LLPIPS (Zhang et al., 2018) measures perceptual similarity, LGRAM captures texture, and LCLIP enforces semantic consistency. For video and 3D assets, we use LV/3Drec = L1 for efficiency, relying on cross-modal transfer from images for details.

Our model starts from SigLIP2 image understanding and progressively adds: (1) image reconstruction, (2) video capabilities with temporal modeling, (3) 3D understanding with expanded resolutions, and optionally (4) discrete tokenization via FSQ. Each box shows the new capabilities introduced at that stage, along with supported resolutions, patch sizes, and sampling strategies.

Semantic Loss. We align visual representations zs with text embeddings through modalityspecific objectives. For images, we distill knowledge from the frozen SigLIP2 vision encoder (Tschannen et al., 2025) by minimizing the KL divergence between temperature-scaled vision-text similarity distributions:

LIsem = KL softmax(τ−1steacher)∥softmax(τ−1sstudent) , (7)

where steacher and sstudent are vision-text similarity scores from frozen SigLIP2 and our model respectively, both paired with the same frozen text encoder, and τ is the temperature parameter. For videos and 3D, we directly optimize alignment using the sigmoid loss from SigLIP (Zhai et al.,

- 2023), which proves more stable for the smaller batch sizes typical in these domains. This dual strategy preserves pretrained image semantics while enabling efficient learning for new modalities.

- 3.4 TRAINING STRATEGY

Our training employs a four-stage progressive curriculum (Figure 5) that builds from image foundations to video dynamics to 3D geometry, with optional discrete quantization. Starting from the pretrained SigLIP2 encoder (Tschannen et al., 2025), we gradually introduce more complex objectives and modalities while maintaining semantic understanding across all stages.

We implement this curriculum through round-robin sampling of modalities and tasks, using gradient accumulation to balance image-text distillation with other objectives (reconstruction, video-text alignment, 3D-text alignment) across all stages. This ensures semantic alignment is preserved even

- as reconstruction capabilities expand. Our sparse transformer architecture facilitates this multimodal training by separating features and positions, allowing each modality to be processed at its natural resolution without padding or packing.

- Stage 1: Image Foundation. Starting from pretrained SigLIP2, we establish core visual representations by adding image reconstruction capabilities. We process images using 4×16×16 space-time patches with temporal padding for consistency, employing 32 latent dimensions following (Yao &

Wang, 2025). Training uses variable resolution sampling from 64 to 512 pixels, with L1 loss computed at native resolution while perceptual losses (LLPIPS, LCLIP, LGram) use 224×224 interpolation to match their pretrained features.

- Stage 2: Video Dynamics. We extend to temporal sequences, expanding latent dimensions from 32 to 48 to accommodate motion complexity (Seawead et al., 2025). Resolution capabilities increase to 1024 for images and 512 for videos. We employ temporal tiling (16-32 frames → 4-8 latent frames) with adaptive sampling: stride 1-3 for temporal consistency or 4-12 for diversity in reconstruction, 1 FPS up to 64 frames for understanding. Our KV-caching mechanism (Figure 6) eliminates redundant computation across tiles while maintaining temporal coherence.
- Stage 3: 3D Geometry. We incorporate 3D assets as active voxels in 643 grids, using Gaussian splatting for reconstruction and attention pooling for understanding. Resolution further increases to 2048 for images and 1024 for videos. Joint optimization across all three modalities prevents catastrophic forgetting while leveraging cross-modal learning. The geometric semantics from 3D and the temporal dynamics from video enhance image reconstruction quality.
- Stage 4: Discrete Tokenization. Optionally, we add FSQ quantization (Mentzer et al., 2023) for discrete generation tasks. The 48-dimensional latents are partitioned into 8 groups of 6 dimensions, each quantized to 4 levels, yielding 8 discrete tokens from 4096-entry codebooks. We finetune the entire encoder and decoder to adapt all modalities to discrete tokens, enabling compatibility with discrete generative models across all visual domains.

Our encoder and decoder each contain 27 transformer blocks with hidden dimension d = 1152 and 16 attention heads. The encoder is initialized from SigLIP-SO400M-patch16-naflex (Tschannen

- et al., 2025), while the decoder is trained from scratch.

We optimize using AdamW with β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.95, and weight decay 0.1. The learning rate follows linear warmup for 2,000 steps to ηmax = 3 × 10−4, then cosine annealing to ηmin =

- 3 × 10−5. Given the pretrained encoder, we apply a reduced learning rate ηencoder = 0.1 × ηbase and use exponential moving average with decay rate γ = 0.9999.

Training utilizes 256 H100 GPUs with adaptive global batch sizes optimized for each task’s memory requirements. Image understanding maintains 8,192 samples throughout all stages, while reconstruction tasks scale with complexity: image reconstruction uses 1,024-4,096, video reconstruction

Table 3: Performance comparison of visual tokenizers across modalities. We evaluate on ImageNet for image reconstruction and zero-shot classification, TokenBench for video reconstruction with MSR-VTT for zero-shot retrieval, and Toys4k for 3D reconstruction and classification. Methods are grouped by capability: reconstruction-only, understanding-only, and unified approaches. Discrete tokenizers are indicated with gray shading. † OmniTokenizer does not work well on high-resolution videos where tiling is needed.

uses 512-1024, and 3D reconstruction uses 256-512. The four-stage curriculum trains for 200k, 200k, 50k, and 100k iterations, respectively, with each stage initialized from the previous checkpoint, requiring a total of 138k GPU hours across all stages (approximately 22 days with 256 GPUs).

Throughout training, we maintain fixed loss coefficients: λrec = 0.2, λsem = 1.0, and λKL = 10−8. Within reconstruction (Eq. 6), we set λ1 = 1.0, λLPIPS = 10.0, λGRAM = 103, λCLIP = 1.0, and τ = 2.0. We normalize reconstruction losses over patches rather than summing (Esser et al., 2020), providing stable gradients across resolutions.

Training data follows our progressive curriculum: DFN (Fang et al., 2023), Open Images (Kuznetsova et al., 2020), and internal datasets for images; WebVid (Bain et al., 2021) and TextVR (Wu et al., 2025c) for video understanding with Panda70M (Chen et al., 2024b) for reconstruction; Objaverse (Deitke et al., 2023) with Cap3D (Luo et al., 2024a) annotations for 3D. Datasets are sampled proportionally to their size, with task ratios detailed in Table 2.

- 4 MAIN RESULTS

We evaluate ATOKEN as the first visual tokenizer to achieve both reconstruction and understanding across images, videos, and 3D assets. This section presents unified comparisons (Section 4.1) followed by per-modality analysis (Sections 4.2-4.4) and ablations (Section 4.5).

- 4.1 UNIFIED TOKENIZER COMPARISONS

- Table 3 presents a comparison of visual tokenizers across modalities. We evaluate on standardized benchmarks: ImageNet (Deng et al., 2009) at 256×256 (reconstruction: PSNR, rFID; understanding: zero-shot accuracy), TokenBench (Agarwal et al., 2025) at 720p and MSR-VTT (Xu et al.,

All images are resized and centercropped to 256×256, with metrics computed using identical scripts. Note that our reproduced results may differ from original papers due to standardized evaluation settings, but provide consistent cross-model comparison.

The results reveal three distinct categories of approaches, each with fundamental limitations. Reconstruction-only tokenizers excel at generation but cannot extract semantic features: SDVAE (Rombach et al., 2022), FLUX.1 (Labs et al., 2025), VA-VAE (Yao & Wang, 2025), and Qwen-Image (Wu et al., 2025a) for images; Hunyuan (Kong et al., 2024) and WAN (Wan et al.,

- 2025) for video; Trellis-SLAT (Xiang et al., 2024) for 3D. Understanding-only encoders provide rich semantics but cannot reconstruct visual content: SigLIP2 (Tschannen et al., 2025), Video-

Prism (Zhao et al., 2024), and PEcore (Bolya et al., 2025). Recent unified attempts combine both capabilities but remain limited to images: SeTok (Wu et al., 2024b), VILA-U (Wu et al., 2024c), and UniTok (Ma et al., 2025a).

ATOKEN-So/C breaks these boundaries as the first tokenizer to unify all three capabilities. On images, we achieve 0.21 rFID with 82.2% zero-shot ImageNet accuracy, substantially outperforming UniTok’s 0.36 rFID and 78.6% accuracy. More importantly, we extend this unified capability to video (3.01 rFVD, 40.2% R@1) and 3D (28.28 PSNR, 90.9% accuracy), comparable or even surpassing specialized methods like Wan2.2 and Trellis-SLAT on Video and 3D reconstruction. Our discrete variant (ATOKEN-So/D) maintains competitive performance, pioneering discrete tokenization across all modalities.

- 4.2 IMAGE TOKENIZATION

We evaluate ATOKEN’s image capabilities against specialized tokenizers through reconstruction quality (Table 4) and semantic understanding (Table 5) benchmarks.

Reconstruction Performance. Table 4 presents our comprehensive evaluation, where we reevaluated all baseline methods using a unified protocol with official implementations to ensure fair comparison. Under this standardized evaluation protocol, we observe that multimodal training enhances rather than compromises image reconstruction. ATOKEN-So/C achieves 0.209 rFID at 16×16 compression, with progressive improvement across training stages: 0.258 (Stage 1)→0.246 (Stage 2)→0.209 (Stage 3), a 19% gain through multimodal expansion.

This improvement is particularly notable given three fundamental challenges in the field. First, the compression-dimension trade-off severely constrains 16×16 models: VAVAE (Yao & Wang, 2025) requires 32-dimensional latents to achieve 0.279 rFID, while Cosmos-CI16×16 with 16 dimensions degrades to 0.959 rFID. Second, transformer architectures consistently underperform convolutional architectures (OmniTokenizer (Wang et al., 2024b) 26.74 PSNR vs. Hunyuan (Kong et al., 2024) 33.32 PSNR), explaining why most reconstruction tokenizers avoid transformers. Third, discrete

tokenizers struggle with generalization – UniTok (Ma et al., 2025a) degrades from 0.362 rFID on ImageNet to 3.918 on COCO, while GigaTok (Xiong et al., 2025) exhibits even larger gaps.

Our approach addresses all three challenges: achieving strong performance with 48-dimensional latents at 16×16 compression, demonstrating transformer viability through adversarial-free training, and maintaining consistent quality across datasets (0.209 rFID on ImageNet, 2.026 rFID on COCO). These results suggest temporal dynamics from video and geometric understanding from 3D provide complementary signals for image reconstruction.

Semantic Understanding. Table 5 evaluates zero-shot classification and retrieval against leading vision encoders. While understanding-only models like CLIP (Radford et al., 2021) and its variants (Xu et al., 2023; Sun et al., 2023; Fang et al., 2023) optimize purely for semantic alignment, ATOKEN need to balance understanding with reconstruction across three modalities.

Despite these constraints, ATOKEN achieves 82.2% ImageNet accuracy – within 1.2% of understanding-only SigLIP2 (Tschannen et al., 2025) (83.4%). This narrows the gap compared to previous unified attempts like UniTok (78.6%) and VILA-U (78.0%), while uniquely extending unified capabilities to video and 3D. Across our progressive training stages, accuracy remains stable (82.7% → 82.3% → 82.2%), with only 0.5% degradation as modalities are added. Discrete quantization also preserves full semantic performance, achieving 82.2% accuracy.

- 4.3 VIDEO TOKENIZATION

We evaluate ATOKEN’s video capabilities through reconstruction quality and semantic understanding benchmarks, demonstrating competitive performance while uniquely supporting both continuous and discrete representations across multiple modalities.

Reconstruction Performance. We evaluate video reconstruction on DAVIS (Pont-Tuset et al.,

- 2017) (1080p, 50 videos) and TokenBench (Agarwal et al., 2025) (720p, 471 videos), reporting PSNR and SSIM for pixel quality, LPIPS for perceptual similarity, and rFVD for temporal consistency. All baselines were re-evaluated using official implementations with consistent protocols and spatial tiling for memory management. ATOKEN employs temporal tiling with KV-caching, leveraging its native 2048×2048 resolution support.

As shown in Table 6, ATOKEN-So/C achieves 33.11 PSNR on DAVIS and 36.07 PSNR on TokenBench, approaching specialized video-only models (Wan2.1 (Wan et al., 2025): 33.50 and 36.11, Hunyuan (Kong et al., 2024): 32.33 and 36.37). Notably, we demonstrate that transformers can match CNN performance when properly designed – our method dramatically outperforms OmniTokenizer’s transformer baseline (21.06 vs 33.11 PSNR on DAVIS) while adding native resolution support. Furthermore, our progressive training reveals cross-modal benefits: incorporating 3D in Stage

- 3 improves video reconstruction from 35.63 to 36.07 PSNR on TokenBench, indicating that geometric understanding may enhance temporal modeling. For discrete tokenization, ATOKEN-So/D pioneers multimodal video support, achieving 29.75 PSNR on DAVIS – surpassing Cosmos-0.1DV (27.26) and dramatically outperforming OmniTokenizer (20.62), while maintaining reasonable perceptual quality (0.288 LPIPS) for downstream tasks.

Semantic Understanding. Table 7 evaluates zero-shot video-text retrieval on MSRVTT (Xu et al., 2016) and MSVD (Chen & Dolan, 2011). Following standard protocols (Wang et al., 2022b; Luo et al., 2021), we use frame embedding averaging with zero-padding. ATOKEN achieves 40.2% R@1 on MSRVTT and 53.5% on MSVD, maintaining reasonable semantic alignment despite optimizing primarily for reconstruction across three modalities. We note that alternative pooling strategies without frame averaging yielded lower performance, likely due to the limited video-text pairs in our training data compared to dedicated video understanding models. While understanding-only models trained on large-scale video-text data achieve higher scores, our results validate that unified tokenization successfully balances reconstruction quality with semantic understanding.

- 4.4 3D TOKENIZATION.

We evaluate ATOKEN’s 3D capabilities on Toys4k (Stojanov et al., 2021b) for reconstruction and semantic understanding. For reconstruction, ATOKEN-So/C achieves 28.28 PSNR and 0.062 LPIPS (Table 8), surpassing the specialized Trellis-SLAT (Xiang et al., 2024) baseline (26.97 PSNR, 0.054

The So400m model maintains or improves performance across all stages, while the Base model shows significant degradation when extending beyond single-modality training, indicating that sufficient model capacity is critical for successful multimodal visual tokenization.

For semantic understanding, ATOKEN-So/C achieves 90.9% zero-shot classification accuracy on Toys4k, validating that our approach maintains strong semantic representations for 3D objects alongside reconstruction capabilities. Combined with our image and video results, this confirms that all three modalities can coexist within a single tokenizer without significant trade-offs.

- 4.5 ABLATION STUDY

Scaling Analysis. To investigate the scaling property of the visual tokenizer, we compare our So400m model with a smaller Base variant following identical training procedures. The Base model initializes from SigLIP-Base-patch16-naflex (Tschannen et al., 2025), comprising 12 transformer blocks with hidden dimension d = 768 and 12 attention heads for both encoder and decoder, yielding approximately 192M parameters compared to So400m’s 800M.

As shown in Figure 7, both models achieve reasonable single-modal performance in Stage 1, with So400m outperforming Base (0.258 vs 0.323 rFID, 82.7% vs 77.2% accuracy). However, the Base model suffers severe degradation when expanding to videos, with ImageNet rFID degrading 49%

- (0.323→0.483) and video PSNR declining across stages. In contrast, So400m improves continuously – ImageNet rFID enhances 19% (0.258→0.209) while video PSNR rises from 32.51 to 33.11. This scaling analysis reveals that multimodal tokenization has a capacity requirement: small models suffer from interference while large models benefit from cross-modal learning.

Representation Structure Analysis. Figure 8 visualizes learned representations through T-SNE projections across training stages. Dense features (a-c) show clear semantic clustering with distinct ImageNet class separation. However, projection to 48-dimensional latents (d-e) results in more intermixed distributions, likely due to KL regularization without post-projection alignment loss.

Despite this apparent mixing in T-SNE visualizations, the model maintains strong reconstruction and understanding performance, suggesting that semantic information may be encoded in ways not captured by 2D projections. This raises an interesting question: whether explicit semantic cluster-

Dense features (a-c) show clear semantic clustering, while dimensional reduction (d-e) leads to more mixed class distributions, suggesting a trade-off between compression and semantic separability.

ing in low-dimensional spaces – as emphasized by methods like VAVAE (Yao & Wang, 2025) – is necessary for strong performance, or whether larger models can effectively leverage seemingly intermixed representations. Our results suggest the latter, though we leave detailed investigation of semantic preservation through aggressive dimensionality reduction for future work.

Reconstruction Visualization. Figures 9-11 provide qualitative comparisons of reconstruction quality across all three modalities. For images (Figure 9), ATOKEN operates at a higher compression ratio (16×) than most baselines yet achieves superior visual fidelity, particularly in preserving high-frequency details such as text clarity, fine textures, and complex patterns. The comparison reveals that methods optimized for lower compression ratios (e.g., SD-VAE and OmniTok at 8×) struggle with text legibility and texture preservation, while ATOKEN maintains sharp details. For video reconstruction (Figure 10), ATOKEN demonstrates temporal consistency comparable to specialized video tokenizers like Wan2.2, with both continuous and discrete variants preserving motion smoothness across 720p sequences. The 3D reconstruction results (Figure 11) highlight ATOKEN’s advantage in color consistency. While Trellis-SLAT exhibits color shifts and artifacts, our unified training across modalities transfers color understanding from images and videos to improve 3D reconstruction.

- 5 DOWNSTREAM RESULTS

Having established ATOKEN’s unified tokenization capabilities across modalities, we evaluate its effectiveness in diverse downstream applications. We assess both understanding tasks through multimodal LLMs (Section 5.1) and generation tasks across images, videos, and 3D assets (Sections 5.2– 5.5). These experiments demonstrate that a single unified tokenizer can serve as the foundation for multimodal AI systems without compromising task-specific performance.

- 5.1 MULTIMODAL LLMS

To validate ATOKEN’s effectiveness for vision-language understanding, we integrate it into SlowFast-LLaVA-1.5 (Xu et al., 2025), replacing the Oryx-ViT (Liu et al., 2024b) vision encoder with ATOKEN-So/C while keeping all other settings identical. To assess generalization, the ATOKEN parameters are frozen during training, with only the SlowFast projector and LLM updated. We evaluate using the lmms-eval (Zhang et al., 2024a) toolkit and report official metrics without output filtering.

Image Understanding. Table 9 shows the image understanding results on 7 standard benchmarks, including RW-QA*, AI2D (Kembhavi et al., 2016), SQA (Lu et al., 2022b), and MMMU (Yue et al.,

- 2024), and MathVISTA (Lu et al., 2024b) for general image QA, as well as OCRBench (Liu et al.,

- 2024a) and TextVQA (Singh et al., 2019) for text and document understanding. To position our models relative to state-of-the-art methods, we compare it against LLaVA-OV (Li et al., 2024a), MM1.5 (Zhang et al., 2025), Molmo (Deitke et al., 2024), BLIP3 (Xue et al., 2024b), Phi-3.5V (Abdin et al., 2024), InternVL2.5 (Zhang et al., 2024b), and Qwen2-VL (Wang et al., 2024c).

SlowFast-LLaVA-1.5-7B ATOKEN-So/C 9K 64.5 70.3 83.7 60.6 69.8 44.8

Here we highlight some key observations. First, compared to Oryx-ViT, a specific vision encoder for multimodal understanding, SlowFast-LLaVA-1.5 with ATOKEN as vision encoder shows overall better performance on image understanding across different model scales. Specifically, Table 9 shows that SlowFast-LLaVA-1.5-7B with ATOKEN outperforms Oryx-ViT under the same MLLM by 1.3% on RW-QA, 1.0% on SQA, and 1.3% on TextVQA. Second, ATOKEN shows strong generalization ability across different tasks and model scales. For reference, using ATOKEN, SlowFast-LLaVA1.5-3B achieves superior results on almost all benchmarks. On RW-QA and AI2D, ATOKEN outperforms Oryx-ViT across the 1B, 3B, and 7B scales and achieves very competitive performance.

Video Understanding. The video understanding results are summarized in Table 10, covering a range of video tasks. Video-MME (Fu et al., 2024), PercepTest (P˘atr˘aucean et al., 2023), and NExTQA (Xiao et al., 2021) assess general video QA, whereas LongVideoBench (Wu et al., 2025b), MLVU (Zhou et al., 2024b), and LVBench (Wang et al., 2024d) focus on temporal understanding on long-range context. We compared with both video specialist models, such as Apollo (Zo-

We report gFID, sFID, Inception Score (IS), Precision (Pre.), and Recall (Rec.). †The VAVAE baseline applies CFG only to the first 3 latent channels, while we follow the standard protocol of applying it to all channels.

har et al., 2024), LLaVA-Video (Zhang et al., 2024c), and LinVT (Gao et al., 2024), and unified image-video MLLMs, such as Oryx1.5 (Liu et al., 2024b), InternVL2.5 (Zhang et al., 2024b), and Qwen2VL (Wang et al., 2024c).

We outline several key observations. First, ATOKEN excels at smaller model scales. For reference, SlowFast-LLaVA-1.5-1.5B with ATOKEN achieves state-of-the-art performance on almost all benchmarks (e.g., outperforming Oryx-ViT by 0.8% on LongVideoBench and 1.4% on LVBench). Second, ATOKENprovides more performance gain on general video QA benchmarks. Specifically, it achieves state-of-the-art results on VideoMME (e.g., 64.5% with 7B LLM) and PercepTest (e.g., 70.3% with 7B LLM) across scales. Third, we note the strong performance of Oryx-ViT on longform video understanding, particularly on MLVU. We hypothesize that this advantage arises because (i) Oryx-ViT was specifically designed for video understanding in LLMs and (ii) it was trained on long-video retrieval tasks. Future work to address this gap includes incorporating more long videos into our training data to strengthen temporal modeling over long-range context.

- 5.2 IMAGE GENERATION WITH CONTINUOUS TOKENS

To evaluate ATOKEN’s generative capabilities with continuous tokens, we assess class-conditional ImageNet generation using the Lightning-DiT (Yao & Wang, 2025) framework. We compare against both general diffusion methods (DiT (Peebles & Xie, 2022), SiT (Ma et al., 2024a)) and reconstruction-specialized approaches (REPA (Yu et al., 2024b), VAVAE (Yao & Wang, 2025)). For fair comparison with VAVAE – a strong baseline optimized specifically for image reconstruction through DINOv2 alignment – we use identical training code, only adapting the input layer for ATOKEN’s 48-dimensional latents (vs. 32 for VAVAE).

We follow standard CFG protocol by applying guidance across all latent channels, using scale 1.65 for our 48-channel models (vs. 1.5 for 32-channel models), consistent with Lightning-DiT findings that wider latents benefit from stronger guidance. Note that VAVAE applies CFG only to the first three channels as reported in their work.

- As shown in Table 11, ATOKEN-So/C Stage 3 achieves 1.56 gFID, competitive with specialized tokenizers despite optimizing for multiple modalities and tasks simultaneously. While VAVAE achieves 1.35 gFID through image-specific optimization and REPA reaches 1.42 through specialized reconstruction alignment, ATOKEN demonstrates that unified tokenization can approach specialized performance without sacrificing versatility. Notably, our Base model shows consistent performance across stages (1.44→1.54→1.58 gFID), while the So model improves from Stage 2 to Stage 3

- (1.88→1.56), suggesting that multimodal training can enhance generation quality.

- Table 12: Discrete Tokenizer Class-conditional Image Generation on ImageNet. We evaluate ATOKENSo/D against other discrete tokenizer-based generation models. Metrics include model parameters, CFG scale, gFID, Inception Score (IS), Precision, and Recall.

ATOKEN-So/D TokenBridge-L 548M 3.1 2.23 274.5 0.79 0.61

##### 5.3 IMAGE GENERATION WITH DISCRETE TOKENS

To evaluate ATOKEN-So/D’s generative capabilities, we integrate it into the TokenBridge (Wang et al., 2025) autoregressive framework, replacing only the tokenizer while maintaining all other settings. The key architectural difference lies in token representation: TokenBridge uses 16 dimensions with 8-level vocabularies, while ATOKEN-So/D uses 8 dimensions with 4096-level vocabularies—a more challenging configuration that requires modeling larger discrete spaces. Additionally, TokenBridge employs FFT-based dimension ordering to generate low-frequency structure first, whereas our model uses sequential generation. Following TokenBridge’s evaluation protocol, we sample 50,000 images with CFG scale 3.1.

- As shown in Table 12, ATOKEN-So/D achieves a gFID of 2.23, demonstrating competitive performance against specialized discrete tokenizers including LFQ (Yu et al., 2023b), TikTok-L (Yu

- et al., 2024a), VQGAN (Esser et al., 2020), UniTok (Ma et al., 2025b), and TokenBridge (Wang
- et al., 2025). While TokenBridge achieves lower gFID (1.76), this gap is expected given our larger vocabulary size (4096 vs. 8) and lack of frequency-based ordering optimization. Notably, we outperform UniTok (2.51 gFID), the only other unified visual tokenizer, demonstrating that multimodal capabilities need not compromise generation quality.

5.4 TEXT TO VIDEO GENERATION

To assess the text-to-video (T2V) capabilities of the ATOKEN-So/C tokenizers, we integrate them into a video generation model. Our model is built upon the MMDiT backbone (Esser et al., 2024) and incorporates design elements from recent video architectures (Wan et al., 2025; Kong et al., 2024; Peng et al., 2025). Due to computational constraints, we conduct experiments with smaller models and limited training data, maintaining consistent settings across all tokenizers for fair comparison. Following a standard two-stage training approach, we first pretrain the model from scratch on textto-image (T2I) tasks with each tokenizer. We then adapt this image model for video generation, enabling evaluation on both T2I and T2V benchmarks. To provide a fair and efficient basis for comparing tokenizers, all training is conducted at low resolutions, using 256×256 for images and 192×336 for videos.

For T2I evaluation, we report CLIP-Score (Hessel et al., 2021), Pick-Score (Kirstain et al., 2023), and GenEval (Ghosh et al., 2023). For T2V tasks, we evaluate performance using the VBench benchmark (Huang et al., 2024). We compare our results against state-of-the-art video tokenizers, namely Cosmos (Agarwal et al., 2025), Hunyuan (Kong et al., 2024), and Wan (Wan et al., 2025). To ensure a fair comparison, we normalize the effective token budget for video generation across all tokenizers by adjusting the patch size. For example, we use a patch size of 2×2 for 8×8 spatial compression and 1×1 for 16×16 compression. Additionally, for T2V generation, we adjust the classifier free guidance (CFG) scale to account for differences in channel size, using a scale of 9.0 for a channel size of 48 and 4.5 for a channel size of 16.

- As shown in Table 13, our ATOKEN-So/C tokenizers achieve results comparable to specialized video-optimized tokenizers across all metrics, outperforming Cosmos and matching the performance of Hunyuan and Wan, even though ours are designed for a broader range of tasks.

- Table 13: Text-to-image and text-to-video generation benchmarks. We compare ATOKEN Stages 2-3 with specialized video tokenizers (Cosmos, Hunyuan, Wan) under resource-constrained settings. Higher scores indicate better performance across all metrics. All models trained with identical data and model sizes for fair comparison.

- 5.5 IMAGE TO 3D SYNTHESIS

To validate the utility of our learned discrete tokens for downstream generative tasks, we train an image-to-3D synthesis model. Following the methodology of Trellis-SLAT (Xiang et al., 2024), we adopt their diffusion model architecture and training regimen. We replace their original 3D tokens with the tokens generated by our ATOKEN-So/C. For a fair comparison, all inference hyperparameters, such as the number of diffusion steps and classifier-free guidance scale, are kept identical to those reported in the original work.

As shown in Figure 14, our approach successfully generates 3D assets from single conditioning images, demonstrating that our tokens are suitable for complex generative modeling. However, we observe that the performance does not yet match the fidelity of the original Trellis-SLAT model. Specifically, while our tokenizer demonstrates excellent reconstruction capabilities that preserve color and structure (as in Figure 11), the generative model sometimes struggles to maintain this consistency. The generated assets do not always adhere strictly to the color and style of the input image.

We hypothesize that this discrepancy arises from the significantly larger latent channel dimension of our tokenizer. ATOKEN-So/C uses 48 latent channels to accommodate rich multimodal information, a substantial increase from the 8 channels used in Trellis-SLAT. A diffusion model operating in this higher-dimensional space likely requires further optimization of training and inference hyperparameters (e.g., conditioning strength, diffusion schedule) to leverage the conditioning signal fully. We leave the exploration of these optimizations as a promising direction for future work.

Reconstruction Tokenizers. High-resolution images have been compressed using deep autoencoders (Hinton et al., 2012; Vincent et al., 2008), which learn lower-dimensional latent representations for reconstruction. VAEs (Kingma & Welling, 2013) extended this framework with probabilistic modeling, while VQ-VAE (Van Den Oord et al., 2017) introduced vector quantization to discretize the latent space. Building on these foundations, subsequent works enhanced reconstruction quality through adversarial training (Rombach et al., 2022; Esser et al., 2020), developed alternative quantization strategies (Lee et al., 2022; Mentzer et al., 2023; Luo et al., 2024b; Zheng et al., 2022), incorporated semantic guidance (Li et al., 2024b;c; Yao & Wang, 2025; Zha et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2024a; 2025; Kim et al., 2025), and scaled model capacity (Xiong et al., 2025).

Video tokenization extended these image-based methods to temporal domains, employing 3D convolutions (Yan et al., 2021; Ge et al., 2022; Yu et al., 2023a), decoupled spatial-temporal processing (Polyak et al., 2024), and causal modeling (Kong et al., 2024; Wan et al., 2025; Yang et al., 2024). Beyond convolutional architectures, recent work has explored Vision Transformers (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020) as an alternative backbone for both image (Yu et al., 2021; 2024a; Hansen-Estruch et al., 2025) and video (Villegas et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2024b;a; Yan et al., 2024) tokenization.

- 3D generation methods initially applied diffusion models directly to various 3D representations (Luo & Hu, 2021; Hui et al., 2022; Shue et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023; He et al., 2024), then shifted toward compact latent spaces for improved efficiency (Gupta et al., 2023; Xiong et al., 2024; Jun & Nichol, 2023; Lan et al., 2024; Nichol et al., 2022). Notably, Trellis (Xiang et al., 2024) introduces

Visual Encoders. Image encoders initially leveraged contrastive learning through vision-language alignment (Radford et al., 2021; Jia et al., 2021; Zhai et al., 2023) and image-only self-supervision (Chen et al., 2020; Oquab et al., 2023). Generative pretraining explored text generation objectives (Wang et al., 2021), discrete token reconstruction (Bao et al., 2021), and masked image modeling (He et al., 2022; Carreira et al., 2024). Methods like NaViT (Dehghani et al., 2023) introduced resolution flexibility with preserved aspect ratios. Recent unified approaches merge contrastive, generative, and self-supervised objectives (Yu et al., 2022a; Tschannen et al., 2025) or leverage intermediate-layer features with task-specific alignment (Bolya et al., 2025).

Video encoders primarily employ self-supervised learning on video-only data (Qian et al., 2021; Feichtenhofer et al., 2021; Recasens et al., 2021; Qian et al., 2022; Tong et al., 2022) or videolanguage modeling with noisy text supervision (Fu et al., 2021; Zellers et al., 2022; Li et al., 2022; Huang et al., 2022; Chen et al., 2023). Recent methods treat video as image sequences, focusing on context window expansion (Team et al., 2024; Xue et al., 2024a) or token compression (Li et al., 2023; Song et al., 2023; Fei et al., 2024; Weng et al., 2024; Xu et al., 2024).

Unified Tokenizers & Multimodal Models. Unified Multimodal Models aim to combine visual understanding and generation within a single framework (Wang et al., 2022a; Mizrahi et al., 2023; Lu et al., 2024a). Many approaches use decoupled tokenizers while employing various generation paradigms – autoregressive (Lu et al., 2022a; Team & Kahn, 2024; Wu et al., 2024a), diffusion (Zhou et al., 2024a), flow-matching (Ma et al., 2024b), and masked prediction (Xie et al., 2024; Tian et al., 2025). Recent efforts on unified tokenizers that handle both tasks include VILA-U (Wu et al., 2024c), which combines pixel reconstruction with contrastive learning in a single vision tower; SeTok (Wu et al., 2024b), which groups visual features into semantic units; UniTok (Ma et al.,

- 2025a), which uses multi-codebook quantization for enhanced expressiveness; and UniToken (Jiao et al., 2025), which produces hybrid discrete-continuous representations through dual encoders. Show-o2 (Xie et al., 2025) extends these approaches by leveraging a 3D causal VAE space with dual-path spatial-temporal fusion, enabling scalability across both image and video modalities while combining autoregressive modeling with flow matching.

- 7 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

The effectiveness of ATOKEN across diverse modalities and tasks suggests new opportunities: visual tokenization can achieve the same unification that transformed language modeling. Our single framework achieves both high-fidelity reconstruction and semantic understanding across images, videos, and 3D assets. This integration became possible through the combination of our sparse

- 4D representation, transformer-based architecture, adversarial-free training strategy, and progressive multimodal curriculum. Due to limited computational resources, we could only test ATOKENon separate downstream tasks. Building the comprehensive omnimodel that would demonstrate ATOKEN’s full potential remains as future work. Looking forward, ATOKEN opens paths for visual foundation models to follow language modeling’s trajectory toward true generalization. We hope this work sheds light on the next-generation multimodal AI systems built upon unified visual tokenization.
