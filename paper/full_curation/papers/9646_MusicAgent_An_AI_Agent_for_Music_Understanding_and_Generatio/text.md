### Abstract

AI-empowered music processing is a diverse field that encompasses dozens of tasks, ranging from generation tasks (e.g., timbre synthesis) to comprehension tasks (e.g., music classification). For developers and amateurs, it is very difficult to grasp all of these task to satisfy their requirements in music processing, especially considering the huge differences in the representations of music data and the model applicability across platforms among various tasks. Consequently, it is necessary to build a system to organize and integrate these tasks, and thus help practitioners to automatically analyze their demand and call suitable tools as solutions to fulfill their requirements. Inspired by the recent success of large language models (LLMs) in task automation, we develop a system, named MusicAgent, which integrates numerous musicrelated tools and an autonomous workflow to address user requirements. More specifically, we build 1) toolset that collects tools from diverse sources, including Hugging Face, GitHub, and Web API, etc. 2) an autonomous workflow empowered by LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT) to organize these tools and automatically decompose user requests into multiple sub-tasks and invoke corresponding music tools. The primary goal of this system is to free users from the intricacies of AI-music tools, enabling them to concentrate on the creative aspect. By granting users the freedom to effortlessly combine tools, the system offers a seamless and enriching music experience. The code is available on GitHub1 along with a brief instructional video2.

Figure 1: MusicAgent has gathered a rich collection of music-related tasks and diverse sources of tools, effectively integrating them with LLMs to achieve proficiency in handling complex music tasks.

of tasks. Mastering this field presents a challenging endeavor due to the wide array of tasks it involves. Generally, the realm of music includes various generation and comprehension tasks, such as songwriting (Sheng et al., 2021; Ju et al., 2021), music generation (Agostinelli et al., 2023; Dai et al., 2021; Lu et al., 2023; Lv et al., 2023), audio transcription (Benetos et al., 2018; Foscarin et al., 2020), music retrieval (Wu et al., 2023b), etc. Specifically, music is a complex art form that weaves together a variety of distinct elements, such as chords and rhythm, to create vibrant and intricate content. Previous works have frequently encountered challenges in collaborating to complete complex music tasks, primarily due to differences in music feature designs and variations across platforms. Therefore,

how to build a system to automatically accomplish music-related tasks from the requests of users with varying levels of expertise is still an enticing direction worth exploring.

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have attracted considerable attention due to their outstanding performance in solving natural language processing (NLP) tasks (Brown et al., 2020; Ouyang et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2022b; Chowdhery et al., 2022; Zeng et al., 2022; Touvron et al., 2023). The huge potentials of LLMs also inspire and directly facilitate many emerging techniques (e.g., in-context learning (Xie et al., 2021; Min et al., 2022), instruct tuning (Longpre et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2022), and chain-of-thought prompting (Wei et al., 2022; Kojima et al., 2022)), which also further elevate the capability of LLMs. On the basis of these LLM capabilities, many researchers have extended the scope of LLMs to various topics. They borrow the idea of acting LLMs as the controllers to orchestrate various domain-specific expert models for solving complex AI tasks, such as HuggingGPT (Shen et al., 2023), AutoGPT and other modality-specifics ones (Chen et al., 2022; Wu et al., 2023a; Huang et al., 2023). These successes also motivate us to explore the possibility to develop a system capable of assisting with various music-related tasks.

Distinguishing from other modalities, incorporating LLMs with music presents the following features and challenges:

- 1. Tool Diversity: On one hand, music-related tasks exhibit a wide range of diversity, and on the other hand, the corresponding tools for these tasks might not always reside on the same platform. These tools could be parameterized models available in open-source communities like GitHub, presented as software and applications, or even hosted through Web APIs for certain retrieval tasks. Considering all these factors is crucial when undertaking a comprehensive music workflow.
- 2. Cooperation: The collaboration between music tools is also constrained by two factors. First, the diversity of music domain tasks leads to the absence of explicit input-output modality standards. Second, even when the modalities are identical, the music formats may differ, for instance, between symbolic music and audio music.

To address these issues, we introduce MusicAgent, a specialized system designed to tackle the challenges. Inspired by recent work like HuggingGPT (Shen et al., 2023), MusicAgent is a framework that utilizes the power of LLMs as the controller and massive expert tools to accomplish user instructions, just as illustrated in Figure 1. For the toolset, in addition to utilizing the models provided by Hugging Face, we further integrate various methods from different sources, including code from GitHub and Web APIs. To make collaboration between diverse tools, MusicAgent enforces standardized input-output formats across various tasks to promote seamless cooperation between tools. As a music-related system, all samples are trimmed to fit within a single audio segment, facilitating fundamental music operations among samples. For more system details and guidance on integrating additional tools, please refer to Section 3.

Overall, the MusicAgent presents several significant contributions:

- • Accessibility: MusicAgent eliminates the need to master complex AI music tools. By utilizing LLMs as the task planner, the system dynamically selects the most suitable methods for each music-related task, making music processing accessible to a broader audience.
- • Unity: MusicAgent bridges the gap between tools from diverse sources by unifying the data format (e.g., text, MIDI, ABC notation, audio). The system enables seamless cooperation among tools on different platforms.
- • Modularity: MusicAgent is highly extensible, allowing users to easily expand its functionality by implementing new functions, integrating GitHub projects, and incorporating Hugging Face models.

#### 2.1 AI-Empowered Music Processing

Music generation and understanding are multifaceted tasks that encompass various sub-tasks. In the realm of music generation, these tasks involve melody generation (Yu et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2022a; Yu et al., 2022), audio generation (Donahue et al., 2018), singing voice synthesis (Ren et al., 2020; Lu et al., 2020), and sound mixing. In contrast, music understanding encompasses track separation (Défossez et al., 2019), audio recognition, score transcription (Bittner et al., 2022), audio

Figure 2: MusicAgent consists of four core components: the task planner, tool selector, task executor, and response generator. Among these, the task planner, tool selector, and response generator are built upon language language models (LLMs). When users make requests, MusicAgent decomposes and organizes the requests into subtasks. The system then selects the most suitable tool for each task. The chosen tool processes the input and populates the anticipated output. The LLM subsequently organizes the output, culminating in a comprehensive and efficient music processing system.

classification (Choi et al., 2017; Zeng et al., 2021), and music retrieval (Wu et al., 2023b). In addition to these diverse and complex music-related tasks, another significant challenge in traditional music processing is substantial differences in input and output formats across each task. These diversities in tasks and data formats also hinder the unification in music processing, which makes it difficult for us to develop a copilot for solving different musical tasks. Therefore, in this paper, we will discuss how to design a copilot to unified musical data format and combine these tools to automatically accomplish tasks by utilizing large language model.

#### 2.2 Large Language Models

The field of natural language processing (NLP) is undergoing a revolutionary shift due to the emergence of large language models (LLMs). These models (Brown et al., 2020; Touvron et al., 2023) have exhibited powerful performance in various language tasks, such as translation, dialogue mod-

eling, and code completion, making them a focal point in NLP.

Based on these advantages, LLMs have been applied to many applications. Recently, a new trend is to use LLMs to build autonomous agents for task automation, just like AutoGPT 3 and HuggingGPT (Shen et al., 2023). In these works, they will leverage an LLM as the controller to automatically analyze user requests and then invoke the appropriate tool for solving tasks. Although there are some successful trials in vision (Chen et al., 2022) or speech (Huang et al., 2023), it is still challenging to build an autonomous agent for music processing, due to its diversity and complexity in tasks and data. Therefore, we present a system called MusicAgent, which integrates various functions to handle multiple music-related tasks, to accomplish requests from different users, including novices and professionals.

### 3 MusicAgent

MusicAgent is a comprehensive system that enhances the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and tailors them to the music domain by integrating additional data sources, dependent tools, and task specialization. As illustrated in Figure 2, MusicAgent designs an LLM-empowered autonomous workflow, which includes three key skills: Task Planner, Tool Selector, and Response Generator. These skills, along with the musicrelated tools forming the Task Executor, are integrated, resulting in a versatile system capable of executing various applications. In this section, we will delve into different aspects of this system, exploring its functionalities and contributions to the field of music processing.

#### 3.1 Tasks and Tools Collection

Table 1 provides a comprehensive overview of the music-related tasks and representative tools gathered in the current MusicAgent. We have organized the task sets based on the music processing flow illustrated in Figure 3.

and music-transcription are under this category. Combining these tasks enables the conversion of music into symbolic representation and the analysis of various music features.

Auxiliary tasks: This category encompasses web search and various audio processing toolkits. Web search includes text search using the Google API, as well as music search through the Spotify API. These tasks primarily provide rich data sources and perform basic operations on audio/MIDI/text data, serving as auxiliary functions.

Furthermore, Figure 3 illustrates the utilization of three main data formats in the system: i) text, which includes lyric, genre or any other attributes related to the music. ii) sheet music, represented as MIDI files, describes the score of the music. iii) audio, containing the sound of the music.

#### 3.2 Autonomous Workflow

The MusicAgent system consists of two parts: the autonomous workflow and the plugins. The au-

tonomous workflow serves as the core LLM interaction component, as shown in Figure 2, and it comprises three skills: Task Planner, Tool Selector, and Response Generator, all supported by the LLM. Figure 4 further demonstrates how these components work together harmoniously.

Task Planner: The Task Planner plays a critical role in converting user instructions into structured information, as most existing music tools only accept specialized inputs. The user input processed by the Task Planner will form the backbone of the entire workflow, encompassing the determination of each subtask and its corresponding input-output format, as well as the dependencies between the subtasks, creating a dependency graph. Leveraging in-context learning, MusicAgent demonstrates excellent task decomposition performance. We provide task planner descriptions, supported tasks, and information structure in the prompt, along with several examples of music task-related decompositions. The user’s interaction history and current

input will replace the content at the corresponding position in the prompt. By utilizing the Semantic Kernel (Microsoft, 2023), users can insert the required task flow in text format, thereby enhancing task planning effectiveness.

Tool Selector: The Tool Selector chooses the most appropriate tool from the open-source tools relevant to a specific subtask. Each tool is associated with its unique attributes, such as textual descriptions, download count, star ratings, and more. By incorporating these tool attributes with the user input, LLM presents the tool’s ID and corresponding reasoning for what it deems the most suitable selection. Users have the flexibility to adjust the tool attributes and determine how LLM interprets these attributes. For instance, users can emphasize download count to meet diverse requirements.

Response Generator: The Response Generator gathers all intermediate results from the execution of subtasks and ultimately compiles them into a coherent response. Examples in Figure 5 demonstrate how LLM organizes the tasks and results to generate answers.

#### 3.3 Plugins

When all the dependent tasks of a subtask have been completed, and all inputs have been instantiated, the LLM backend passes the task to the Task Executor, where the tool selects the necessary parameters from the inputs. Additionally, the tool needs to identify the task type, as a tool may handle multiple tasks.

MusicAgent stores model parameters on the CPU and only loads them into the GPU when actively in use. This approach is especially advantageous for users with limited GPU memory, as it optimizes resource utilization and ensures smooth task execution without overburdening the GPU memory.

### 4 System Usage

In this section, we will provide comprehensive guidelines on how to effectively use the MusicAgent toolkit.

#### 4.1 Code Usage

Users have the flexibility to run this system either by following the instructions on GitHub or by integrating it as a module in their code or using it through the command line for more advanced usage, enabling the incorporation of custom tools. As

depicted in Listing 1, users can add custom task types, update tool attributes, and design prompts for each subtask, enhancing support for specific tasks. It is important to note that embedding the prompt in the history is a temporary operation, and there is a possibility of overlap if the context exceeds the limit. For permanent storage, it is recommended to directly include the prompt in the code.

#### 4.2 Demo Usage

Apart from command-line usage, we have also provided a Gradio demo for users, where an OpenAI token is required. In the Gradio demo, users can directly upload audio and visually observe all the intermediate results generated by the system, as depicted in Figure 6. Additionally, although MusicAgent includes built-in context truncation, users can still clear all LLM interaction history in the interface to refresh the agent.

### 5 Conclusion

In this paper, we introduce MusicAgent, an LLMpowered autonomous agent in the music domain. Our system can be considered as an auxiliary tool to help developers or audiences to automatically analyze user requests and select appropriate tools as solutions. Moreover, our framework directly integrates numerous music-related tools from various sources (e.g., Hugging Face, GitHub, Web search and etc). We also adapt the autonomous

workflow to enable better compatibility in musical tasks and allow users to extend its toolset. In the future, we also further envision integrating more music-related functions into MusicAgent.
