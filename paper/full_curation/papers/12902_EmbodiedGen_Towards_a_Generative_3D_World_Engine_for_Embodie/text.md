- Figure 1. EmbodiedGen, a toolkit for embodied intelligence interactive 3D world generation. EmbodiedGen enables controllable generation of rigid and articulated assets with accurate real-world scale and physical properties, along with stylistically diverse background generation and visually rich texture generation and editing. These assets can be seamlessly integrated into various simulators such as OpenAI Gym[4], Isaac Lab[26], MuJoCo[42] and SAPIEN[49]. These capabilities form a foundation for digital twinning, large-scale data augmentation and embodied intelligence tasks such as manipulation and navigation across a wide range of simulation environments.

## Abstract

Constructing a physically realistic and accurately scaled simulated 3D world is crucial for the training and evaluation of embodied intelligence tasks. The diversity, realism, low cost accessibility and affordability of 3D data assets are critical for achieving generalization and scalability in embodied AI. However, most current embodied intelligence tasks still rely heavily on traditional 3D computer graphics assets manually created and annotated, which suffer from high production costs and limited realism. These limitations significantly hinder the scalability of data driven approaches. We present EmbodiedGen, a foundational platform for interactive 3D world generation. It enables the scalable generation of high-quality, controllable and photorealistic 3D assets with accurate physical properties and real-world scale in the Unified Robotics Description Format (URDF) at low cost. These assets can be directly imported into various physics simulation engines for fine-grained physical control, supporting downstream tasks in training and evaluation. EmbodiedGen is an easy-to-use, fullfeatured toolkit composed of six key modules: Image-to-3D, Text-to-3D, Texture Generation, Articulated Object Generation, Scene Generation and Layout Generation. EmbodiedGen generates diverse and interactive 3D worlds composed of generative 3D assets, leveraging generative AI to address the challenges of generalization and evaluation to the needs of embodied intelligence related research. EmbodiedGen1 are publicly available to foster future research.

## 1. Introduction

Despite the remarkable success of foundation models such as CLIP [35] and GPT [1, 34], which leverage largescale internet data, extending this paradigm to the needs of embodied intelligence related research presents significant challenges. Data collection for embodied AI tasks is substantially more expensive and constrained, often requiring real world interaction, involving complex physical dynamics, making each data point several orders of magnitude more costly. Moreover, robotic data is often context-specific and non-transferable across tasks or embodiments, severely limiting reusability and scalability. Achieving general-purpose embodied intelligence in the physical world requires techniques such as digital twins, simulation-based augmentation, and reinforcement learning in physically realistic environments. These goals demand access to large-scale, diverse, and high-quality 3D asset libraries, as well as efficient pipelines for rapidly constructing interactive 3D environments. Recent advances in diffusion

based generative models [16, 29, 37, 47] and 3D asset generation [5, 11, 12, 23, 31, 57] have sparked growing interest in bridging this gap. However, existing 3D generation toolkit often fall short for robotics applications, as conventional graphics assets typically lack physical realism, watertight geometry and accurate scale, leading to unreliable collision modeling and unrealistic interactions in simulators. We introduce EmbodiedGen, a toolkit for interactive 3D world generation, enables low-cost, high-quality, and highly controllable asset generation in URDF, complete with watertight geometry and physically plausible properties. Our main contributions are:

- 1. Toolkit for interactive 3D world generation. EmbodiedGen is the first comprehensive toolkit for generating interactive 3D worlds to the needs of embodied intelligence related research. It supports real-to-sim digital twin creation and enables the controllable generation of diverse 3D assets, which can be seamlessly imported into simulators.
- 2. Physically accurate, simulator-ready assets with high fidelity. EmbodiedGen generates assets that not only achieve state-of-the-art visual quality but are also physically plausible and ready for direct use in simulation environments. Each asset is enriched with physical properties, inspection metadata, textual descriptions, watertight geometry and dual representations in both 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and mesh formats.
- 3. Accessible and open-source. We release easy-to-use, open-sourced pipelines and services to facilitate community development and research in embodied intelligence.

- 2. Related Work
- 3D Asset Generation The goal of 3D object generation is to produce a corresponding 3D representation from an input image or a textual description. Existing approaches to this task can be broadly categorized into three representative paradigms: feedforward generation, optimizationbased generation, and view reconstruction. Feedforward generation leverages large models to produce a 3D representation of the input prompt in a single forward pass. This category includes methods such as LRM[11], PixelSplat[5], GRM[52], and MVSplat[6], which are notable for their inference time efficiency. Optimization-based generation, as exemplified by methods like DreamFusion[30] and DreamMat[58], directly optimizes the parameters of the 3D representation using score distillation sampling (SDS) guided by diffusion models and differentiable rendering. This often results in higher-quality outputs at the cost of increased computation time. View reconstruction methods generate multi-view 2D images and reconstruct the final 3D representation via sparse-view geometry. Representative works in this line include Zero123[22], Unique3d[46], MVDream[39], and MV-Adapter[17]. Driven by the

- Figure 2. The framework of EmbodiedGen. It enables the creation of a digital twin within a simulation environment from a single image. Alternatively, given a task description, EmbodiedGen autonomously generates the scene layout, synthesizes detailed 3D object assets, and arranges them in semantically and physically plausible configurations. This facilitates the effortless construction of an interactive 3D world, supporting a wide range of embodied intelligence related research in diverse virtual environments.

Embodied Intelligence Tasks Prior works such as RoboTwin[28], Gen2Sim[18], MatchMaker[45] and ACDC[9] have explored using 3D generation techniques to augment asset libraries within simulators. However, due to limitations in the quality and efficiency of 3D generation, the diversity of assets remains limited, and the environments are often restricted to simplistic backgrounds, which are insufficient for large-scale data generation and evaluation in embodied intelligence tasks. To address these challenges, we propose EmbodiedGen, a data-centric foundation for embodied AI, enables the generation of diverse object and background assets from either images or text prompts, and supports texture editing for enhanced visual richness. This framework effectively supports real-to-sim transfer, data augmentation, and physics-based simulation in different simulators[4, 26, 42, 49], accelerating the development of embodied intelligence systems.

demand for higher-quality 3D objects, recent methods such as CLAY[56], Hunyuan3D[41], Meta3DGen[3], and Trellis[50] have adopted a decoupled pipeline separating geometry and texture generation into two stages, followed by texture reprojection to fuse geometry with realistic textures. Beyond rigid object generation, methods such as URDFormer[7] and SINGAPO[21] have been proposed to generate articulated objects. However, these methods are primarily limited to graphics-centric object generation. The resulting objects lack real-world scale and physical properties, and there is no guarantee of watertightness or geometric integrity. These limitations significantly hinder their direct applicability in physics-based simulators.

3D Scene Generation Recent methods like LucidDreamer[8] adopt 3DGS[19] for flexible and consistent scene rendering, but are mainly limited to forward facing views. To enable full 360° scene generation, panoramic representations have been explored. PERF[43] pioneered panoramic NeRFs for novel view synthesis from a single panorama. DreamScene360[60], HoloDreamer[59] and WorldGen[51] extended this with panoramic Gaussian splatting, while LayerPano3D[53] introduced layered panoramas that are lifted into 3D splatting for handling complex scenes. However, these methods are limited to generating static 3D scenes without interactivity, making them unsuitable for the requirements of embodied intelligence related research.

## 3. Generative 3D World Engine

We present EmbodiedGen, a novel framework for generating interactive 3D worlds to the needs of embodied intelligence related research. Leveraging generative AI, our approach enables the creation of diverse, customizable environments that support the development and evaluation of embodied agents (see Figure 2).

In this section, we first present the 3D object generation modules, including Image-to-3D, which generates physically realistic 3D object assets from a single image to facilitate digital twin creation (Sec.3.1), and Text-to-3D, which

generates 3D objects from text descriptions for low cost, high-quality data augmentation (Sec.3.2). We then introduce Articulated Object Generation (Sec.3.3), which produces manipulable articulated 3D assets from either dualstate image pairs or text descriptions. Texture Generation is described in Sec.3.4, enabling highly controllable and multi-style texture editing for 3D assets. Finally, we present Scene Generation (Sec. 3.5), which generates diverse background environments and supports the composition of interactive 3D scenes.

### 3.1. Image-to-3D Object Generation

Method Overview The capabilities of community-driven 3D object asset generation are rapidly advancing and are expected to continue improving. To fully leverage this progress, we focus on building an image-to-3D system to the needs of embodied intelligence related research. For the model component, we leverage open-source models. This approach ensures that our image-to-3D capabilities can be easily extended as community models improve. Specifically, we use Trellis[50] due to its superior geometric generation quality and its ability to produce consistent 3D representations in both mesh and 3DGS[19] formats. However, Trellis has several limitations that hinder its direct use in embodied AI tasks: the generated textures exhibit poor visual quality, particularly due to excessive highlights that result in noticeable whitening when baked onto the mesh. Additionally, the resulting files are purely graphical assets without real-world scale, physical properties, or physically plausible geometry, making them unsuitable for direct use in physics simulators[26, 42, 49]. We focus on three key improvements: (1) developing a complete data twinning pipeline for embodied intelligence asset generation, capable of producing data assets with realistic properties, accurate scale, and physically consistent watertight geometry that can be directly imported into simulation engines; (2) enhancing texture quality by applying highlight removal and super-resolution, resulting in high-quality, high-resolution

textures; (3) developing a diffusion-based model for articulated 3D object generation to meet the growing demand for complex data assets in diverse simulation tasks.

Physically Realistic 3D Asset Generation As illustrated in Figure 3, we leverage Trellis[50] to generate 3D representations of input images. We further employ GPT-4o[1] and Qwen[10] to build a physics expert agent. Specifically, the agent estimates the real-world height of the asset by rendering a frontal view of the generated object and applying text prompt constraints. Given that width, length, and height are interdependent, scaling the height enables accurate recovery of the mesh and 3DGS’s true dimensions. For assets with inherent ambiguity in size, a text-guided physical property restoration interface is available, allowing users to specify context (e.g., “a tiger plush toy” or “a tiger animal”) for more accurate size prediction. Given four orthographic views of a rendered 3D asset as input, the physics expert agent can further estimate physical properties such as friction coefficient and mass, associate them with semantic descriptions, and categorize the object 3D assets accordingly.

Automated Quality Inspection We develop an automated quality inspection module, utilizing the AestheticChecker [38] as a measure of visual quality, as it has a positive correlation with texture richness, see Figure 4. We found that the quality of foreground segmentation has a significant impact on the quality of 3D asset generation, so we further build a ImageSegChecker using GPT-4o for foreground extraction quality assessment, see Figure 5. To ensure robust segmentation quality across different domains, we provide three different foreground segmentation models, SAM[20], REMBG[15], RMBG14[2]. If ImageSegChecker detects a segmentation failure, the system switches to an alternative model for retry. A MeshGeoChecker inspects the asset by rendering four orthogonal views and assessing geometric completeness and rationality, see Figure 6. Assets

that pass the quality inspection are converted into URDF format and stored. Those that fail any stage of the pipeline are sent back to the corresponding generation step using adjusted settings and seeds.

Texture Back Projection Optimization Unlike methods like Trellis that rely on optimization-based baking of multi-view RGB images rendered from 3DGS[19] back into 3D space, our optimized approach employs a geometrydetermined projection scheme fused with view normals. Before re-projecting textures back into 3D space, we apply global highlight removal and super-resolution to the RGB images, resulting in high-quality, 2K resolution texture UV maps. Specifically, we use a delighting model[41] to remove lighting effects from the multi-view textures while maintaining consistent style and brightness across views. We further apply Real-ESRGAN [44] to independently perform 4x super-resolution on each view, enhancing the resolution to 2048x2048. Our experiments show that independent super-resolution for each view does not compromise the consistency or quality of the final 3D asset texture. The algorithmic workflow is illustrated in Algorithm 1. We

present in Figure 7 the improvement in mesh texture quality achieved by the optimized texture back-projection module.

### 3.2. Text-to-3D Object Generation

Method Overview The Text-to-3D module is designed for highly controllable generation of 3D object assets with diverse geometry and textures. To achieve this, the textto-3D task is decomposed into two stages: text-to-image and image-to-3D. This decoupling brings several advantages. In large-scale asset production, it enables early-stage automatic quality inspection, allowing the system to filter out samples that fail foreground segmentation check or contain semantics inconsistent with the text description before committing computational resources to 3D generation. More importantly, this modular design improves iteration flexibility and reduces maintenance costs. It also allows the pipeline to fully benefit from ongoing advancements in the text-to-image and image-to-3D communities, supporting continuous improvement in controllability, scalability, and asset generation quality. Specifically, Kolors[40] is used as our text-to-image generation model, as it supports high-quality image generation from both Chinese and English prompts. For the image-to-3D stage, we maintain a single unified service, EmbodiedGen Image-to-3D, to streamline system complexity. As shown in Figure 8, compared to Trellis-text-xlarge[50], our two-stage design offers improved controllability and generation quality, while significantly reducing the maintenance cost associated with end-to-end text-to-3D models. The large-scale asset generation workflow for text-to-3D is illustrated in Figure 9.

The pipeline proceeds through text-to-image and image-to-3D stages, each equipped with automatic quality inspection and retry mechanisms. The final URDF asset with complete geometry, realistic scale, and physical properties, is persistently stored.

Evaluation of Automated Quality Inspection We evaluate the efficiency of the automated quality inspection module in large-scale 3d asset generation. We construct the automated quality inspection pipeline based on AestheticChecker, ImageSegChecker, and MeshGeoChecker, as introduced in Section 3.1. During evaluation, a generated asset is considered usable if it satisfies the following criteria: geometric and textural consistency with the input text description, geometric completeness, texture richness, and compatibility with simulation engines. Otherwise, it is classified as unusable. We define precision as the proportion of assets identified as unusable by the automated checkers that are indeed unusable, and recall as the proportion of all truly

unusable assets that are correctly flagged by the checkers. We generated 150 cup 3d assets and manually annotated them. Among these, 107 were labeled as usable and 43 as unusable. The automated quality inspection achieved a precision of 68.7% and a recall of 76.7%. While these metrics are not yet above 90%, the current system substantially reduces the manual effort required for asset screening. Moreover, we expect that this pipeline will continue to improve as multi-modal large models advance, further enhancing automated quality assessment in the future.

### 3.3. Articulated Object Generation

Articulated objects such as cabinets, drawers and appliances are common in real world environments. Modeling these objects accurately requires not only capturing their geometric structure but also understanding their motion behavior and part connectivity. This capability is fundamental for tasks in virtual simulation, robotics, and interactive environments [14, 27, 33].

Method Overview We use DIPO [48], a controllable generation framework that constructs articulated 3D objects from a dual-state image pair. One image shows the object in a resting state, and the other shows it in an articulated state. This dual-state input format encodes both structural and kinematic information, enabling the model to better resolve motion ambiguity and predict joint behavior. The generation process is based on a diffusion transformer that integrates these two images using a specialized dual-state injection module at each layer. DIPO also includes a chainof-thought based Graph Reasoner that infers connectivity relationship between each part. The resulting articulation graph is used as an attention prior to enhance generation consistency and plausibility.

Automatic Articulated Object Data Augmentation Beyond model design, to improve generalization on complex articulated object generation, we use an automatic data augmentation pipeline to synthesize articulated object layouts from natural language prompts using grid-based spatial reasoning and part retrieval from existing 3D datasets. The resulting PM-X dataset comprises 600 structurally diverse articulated objects, each annotated with rendered images and physical properties. Figure 10 shows representative examples from the PM-X dataset.

Qualitative comparison Figures 1 illustrates representative results of generated objects with real-world image inputs. Explore more demos of dynamic articulated object on our project page.

### 3.4. Texture Generation

Method Overview The texture generation module is designed to perform multi-style texture generation and editing for 3D object assets. Given a 3D mesh as input, it outputs a textured 3D mesh with generated visual appearance. Instead of training a multi-view diffusion model from scratch, we design a plug-gable and extensible module that leverages existing 2D text-to-image foundation models and extends their capabilities into the 3D domain. Our approach enables the generation of diverse and high-quality textures that are geometrically consistent across views. This design

paradigm allows us to capitalize on continuous improvements in community foundation models, enabling costeffective and scalable generation of view-consistent textures with minimal retraining effort.

Model Design We develop a model named GeoLifter, a module that extends the capabilities of foundation text-toimage diffusion models to multi-view generation with geometric consistency. GeoLifter injects geometric control into the base diffusion model through cross-attention mechanisms, enabling view-consistent texture generation conditioned on 3D geometry. We adopt Kolors text-to-image[40] as the base diffusion model. In contrast to approaches such as ControlNet[55], which duplicate and train a separate encoder branch of the base model’s U-Net. GeoLifter remains lightweight and highly extensible. Its parameter size does not grow with the depth of the base model, making it more efficient and easier to integrate with evolving diffusion architectures.

Given an input mesh, we render normal maps, position maps and binary masks from six predefined camera views (elevations ∈ {20◦,−10◦}, azimuths ∈ {0◦,60◦,120◦,180◦,240◦,300◦}). For each view, the normal and position maps are rendered in image space from camera view, and concatenated along the spatial (height and width) dimensions within each attribute. The different attribute types (normal, position, mask) are then concatenated along the channel dimension to form the geometric condition input G ∈ RH×W×7. The normal map encodes surface normals interpolated per vertex and projected to the image plane. The position map stores the XYZ coordinates (in object space) of visible vertices. The mask is a binary segmentation map. The geometric condition G is then implicitly encoded into a feature embedding, which is progressively injected into the denoising process of the diffusion model via cross-attention, leveraging zero convolution to ensure

The text prompt supports both positive and negative prompts, and accepts multi-lingual input, including both Chinese and English descriptions, to specify the desired texture style and appearance. In addition to textual prompts, users may optionally provide an RGB image as a reference style, which serves as a complementary control signal to the language input. Users can provide a text prompt only, a reference image only, or both simultaneously. This design enables highly controllable and expressive texture generation by jointly leveraging semantic guidance and visual style cues.

We observe that GeoLifter, with its lightweight geometric conditioning design, effectively preserves the texture generation capability of the underlying foundation model, while significantly improving spatial and geometric consistency across views. Following the multi-view texture generation, we apply illumination removal and super-resolution techniques and project the refined textures back into 3D space to obtain the final textured mesh, equipped with a high-resolution 2K UV map as described in Algorithm 1.

Qualitative Comparison We conduct a qualitative comparison between our method and several state-of-theart texture generation methods, including TEXTure[36], SyncMVD[24], Paint3D[54], Meshy[25], and Hunyuan3d2[12]. As shown in Figure 13, our method consistently produces higher-quality 3D textures, with superior geometric consistency across views. Furthermore, our method uniquely supports specified text to be directly generated on 3D surfaces.

b denotes the extracted feature vectors at the corresponding coordinates. Standard element-wise smooth L1 loss is applied to encourages the latent features of pixels corresponding to the same 3D point (projected across multiple views) to remain close in feature space, thereby en-

### 3.5. 3D Scene Generation

Method Overview Beyond 3D object asset generation, scene diversity as background context plays an equally crit-

ical role. We develop a scalable and efficient framework for 3D scene generation. The system follows a modular pipeline that transforms multi-modal inputs into panoramic images, which are then used to generate 3D scenes with

Panoramic Image Generation Our method supports both text- and image-based input modalities, or a combination of both, enabling flexible and efficient generation of high-quality panoramic images. For text-driven generation, user-provided scene descriptions are translated into panoramic views using Diffusion360 model[13], which have demonstrated strong performance in this task. For image-driven generation, we employ Qwen [10] to extract semantic descriptions from the input image. The image and its corresponding textual description are then jointly processed by the panorama generation model[13] to generate semantically aligned panoramas(see Figure 15). To ensure quality and reliability, we introduce the PanoSelector module, which is built upon Qwen [10], automatically evaluates and filters the generated panoramas based on structural quality metrics, such as floor and wall consistency. This guarantees that only high-quality outputs are forwarded to the geometry generation stage.

ther refine the initial 3DGS, effectively enhancing the detail quality of the final 3DGS output as in Figure 16. We show generated 3D scene quality comparison with worldgen[51] in Figure 17.

Scene 3D Representation Generation After obtaining high-quality panoramas, the system proceeds to generate the corresponding 3D representation in 3DGS and mesh based on Pano2Room[32]. An initial mesh is generated from the panoramic input and further refined through mesh optimization to improve both geometric accuracy and reconstruct-ability. The optimized mesh is then converted into a 3DGS representation. To enhance visual fidelity, views rendered from the optimized mesh are converted into cubemaps and passed through the super-resolution model[44]. The super-resolved images are then used to fur-

Physics Restoration To produce realistic and metrically consistent 3D scenes, the system performs absolute scale estimation by predicting real-world dimensions such as building height from the input panoramas and their semantic descriptions. A dedicated scale estimation module, built upon the Qwen model [10], infers these scale factors to enable lossless rescaling of both the mesh and 3DGS[19]

representations. Additionally, the coordinate system is recentered to the floor plane of the scene, with the axes aligned according to either the camera direction from the input image or the orientation implied by the textual description. The resulting output is a scale-aligned, high-fidelity 3D scene asset, ready for downstream use in virtual and augmented reality and robotics.

## 4. Application

Large-scale 3D Asset Generation Figure 18 showcases the capability of the EmbodiedGen Text-to-3D module to generate large-scale 3D assets for embodied intelligence tasks, producing watertight and stylistically diverse meshes aligned with textual descriptions. This capability enables low-cost augmentation of interactive 3D assets for simulation and downstream training and evaluation.

Visual Appearance Editing of 3D Mesh Figure 19 demonstrates the capability of the EmbodiedGen texture generation module to generate and edit photorealistic textures with rich visual details. The edited 3D assets can be used for training data augmentation, enhancing model generalization in visual appearance understanding.

Real-to-Sim: Digital Twins creation The real-to-sim capabilities of EmbodiedGen Image-to-3D module is illus-

trated in Figure 21, with the generated 3D assets evaluated via closed loop simulation in the Isaac Lab[26] environment. Figure 23 shows how assets generated by EmbodiedGen Text-to-3D can be used in navigation and obstacle avoidance tasks within the OpenAI Gym[4] simulation framework.

RoboSplatter: Integration of 3DGS Rendering into Physical Simulation Existing simulators are typically built upon traditional OpenGL-based rendering techniques, which involve complex environment modeling, lighting setup, and ray-based rendering calculations. These approaches often suffer from high computational cost and limited photorealism. With the rapid advancement of 3DGS[19], more realistic and efficient rendering solutions have emerged. We integrate 3DGS rendering with established physical simulators such as MuJoCo [42] and Isaac Lab [26], enabling visually rich and physically accurate simulations. To this end, we develop RoboSplatter, a 3DGS-based simulation rendering framework tailored for robotics simulation. As shown in Figure 20, RoboSplatter works seamlessly with MuJoCo to simulate robotic manipulation tasks, such as robotic arm grasping, while delivering high visual fidelity powered by 3DGS technology.

## 5. Conclusion

In this work, we present EmbodiedGen, the first comprehensive platform for interactive 3D world generation to the needs of embodied intelligence related research. Our system enables controllable and diverse creation of real-tosim digital twins, alongside large-scale generation of 3D rigid and articulated object and 3D scene assets. These assets can be seamlessly integrated into various simulators such as OpenAI Gym[4], Isaac Lab[26], MuJoCo[42] and SAPIEN[49] for tasks such as ground-truth generation, evaluation, and reinforcement learning. The generated assets achieve state-of-the-art quality in both visual fidelity and physical realism, and are enriched with detailed annotations, including quality inspection labels, watertight geometry, and dual 3D representations in both 3DGS[19] and mesh formats. To promote research and practical adoption, we release the pipeline as an open-source, user-friendly toolkit and service.
