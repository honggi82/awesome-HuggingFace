## Abstract

Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for post-training large language models (LLMs), achieving state-of-the-art performance on tasks with structured, verifiable answers. Applying RLVR to Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) presents significant opportunities but is complicated by the broader, heterogeneous nature of vision-language tasks that demand nuanced visual, logical, and spatial capabilities. As such, training MLLMs using RLVR on multiple datasets could be beneficial but creates challenges with conflicting objectives from interaction among diverse datasets, highlighting the need for optimal dataset mixture strategies to improve generalization and reasoning. We introduce a systematic post-training framework for Multimodal LLM RLVR, featuring a rigorous data mixture problem formulation and benchmark implementation. Specifically, (1) We developed a multimodal RLVR framework for multi-dataset post-training by curating a dataset that contains different verifiable vision-language problems and enabling multi-domain online RL learning with different verifiable rewards; (2) We proposed a data mixture strategy that learns to predict the RL fine-tuning outcome from the data mixture distribution, and consequently optimizes the best mixture. Comprehensive experiments showcase that multi-domain RLVR training, when combined with mixture prediction strategies, can significantly boost MLLM general reasoning capacities. Our best mixture improves the post-trained model’s accuracy on out-of-distribution benchmarks by an average of 5.24% compared to the same model post-trained with uniform data mixture, and by a total of 20.74% compared to the pre-finetuning baseline.

## 1 Introduction

Multimodal large language models (MLLMs)[46] are significantly expanding the frontiers of artificial intelligence. They integrate diverse data types like images and audio with text to achieve a more comprehensive understanding and enable richer, human-natural AI interactions, unlocking advanced capabilities such as cross-modal reasoning and spatial intelligence [50, 1, 31, 42]. Effective posttraining of multimodal LLMs remains challenging as they must integrate diverse data modalities, whose data is orders of magnitude scarcer than text-only LLMs [58] and present fundamentally different problem features. They translate into a broad spectrum of distinct capabilities—spatial

Recently, reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR)[54, 44] has emerged as a powerful post-training paradigm for text-based language models, delivering state-of-the-art performance in domains with programmatically checkable answers, such as mathematics and code. By replacing noisy human preferences with rule-based signals, RLVR yields stable optimization and strong generalization[54, 15, 44]. However, using RLVR to enable MLLMs presents significant challenges due to the relative scarcity of accessible verifiable datasets compared to the huge demand for data driven by inherently richer and heterogeneous multimodal tasks. Each verifiable reward tackles a slice of that capability spectrum, leaving large gaps in multimodal reasoning. Existing effective attempts that transfer vision tasks into verifiable reward signals for RL fine-tuning often only focus on one specific multimodal task domain (e.g., VQA [7], object detection [55], math [49, 26], and video [14]). Such single-domain focus is inadequate for achieving the wide range of capabilities required by MLLMs.

To address this, it is beneficial to incorporate multiple datasets from diverse multimodal task domains during post-training, rather than relying on a single dataset, to ensure broad coverage and generalization across a wide range of capabilities. This is particularly important for multimodal LLMs, given the vast number of distinct tasks arising from multimodal compositions. However, using multiple training datasets introduces challenges, including potential conflicting objectives resulting from interactions among diverse datasets, as well as corresponding unstable behaviors during training. These challenges underscore the need to optimize dataset mixture strategies. Notably, data mixture has been extensively investigated and has demonstrated its effectiveness in various scenarios, such as supervised deep learning, pre-training LLMs, and supervised fine-tuning. Here we seek to answer:

(Q) How to mix diverse datasets in RLVR to achieve the wide range of multimodal capabilities? To enable efficient multi-dataset multimodal RLVR for multimodal LLM, our main contributions are:

- • We develop a novel multimodal RLVR framework for multi-dataset post-training, designed to optimize the strategies for mixing these datasets to achieve desired capabilities. This includes the creation of five image-text datasets with different verifiable rewards, as well as the RLVR framework for training on these datasets (Sec. 3.2).
- • We propose a multi-domain data mixture optimization strategy, which learns a surrogate function to predict the outcome of RL finetuning given the mixture distribution (??). We show that a multivariate quadratic function can capture the counterfactual interplay among different datasets (Fig. 6).
- • We comprehensively evaluate the performance on various evaluation sets, including MMMU, MathVista, InfoVQA, and ChartQA. The predicted optimal data mixture distribution drives the finetuned model to have strong and generalizable reasoning capability, compared with any other standalone or naive mixture recipes (Sec. 3.3).

## 2 Multimodal RLVR with Data Mixtures

In this section, we first present the problem formulation of RLVR with data mixtures. Subsequently, we propose an approach to optimize the data mixture strategy using a two-step procedure, incorporating a prior model for the objective of the inner optimization problem.

### 2.1 Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) with Data Mixtures

Background: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) for Post-Training. A large language model (LLM) is designed to process a prompt x ∈ X and generate a response a ∈ A according to a policy π : X  → ∆(A). The training of LLMs typically involves two phases: pretraining and post-training, both utilizing the same model architecture. After pre-training, a reference policy πref : X → ∆(A) is obtained.

In the post-training phase, Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) has emerged as a powerful and scalable approach to align LLMs with desired capabilities and preferences, such as reasoning. RLVR can be viewed as a variant of reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF), but instead of relying on a learned reward model from human preferences, it utilizes verifiable, criteria-based rewards r : X × A → [0,1] that directly encode reasoning and accuracy requirements [16]. For instance, the reward can be (1) verifiable correctness, (2) verification via execution, or (3) verifiable constraints. These rewards are typically more transparent and less susceptible to reward hacking compared to learned reward models, which often require careful design and tuning for specific datasets.

Suppose we have access to a dataset of prompts D = {xi} drawn from a distribution xi ∼ µ ∈ ∆(X). Let the policy πθ be parameterized by θ. Except for the reward specification, RLVR for post-training follows the same pipeline as RLHF and is formulated as:

θ(·|x) [r(x,a) − βDKL(πθ(·|x)∥πref(·|x)], (1) where DKL(·) represents the Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence.

RLVR with Data Mixtures. In practice, we often aim to fine-tune an LLM to perform well across a variety of tasks, which naturally benefits from training on multiple datasets spanning diverse domains. Without loss of generality, suppose we have access to m multimodal datasets D = {Di,ri}mi=1, each associated with a domain-specific verifiable reward function ri : X × A → [0,1]. Each dataset Di = {xi,j}|Dj=1i| contains prompts drawn from distribution xi,j ∼ µi. The ultimate goal is to achieve an optimally generalizable MLLM in a testing prompt distribution µtest with corresponding verifiable reward rtest, which potentially not only encompasses the tasks within the m domains used during training but also extends to another n out-of-distribution domains (multimodal tasks).

Now we are ready to provide the formulation of Multimodal RLVR with Data Mixtures. We consider training the LLM using a mixture of the m datasets, weighted by w ∈ ∆m, where w is a probability distribution over the m datasets. This results in a mixed training distribution: µ(w) = mi=1 wiµi. The objective of RLVR with data mixtures is to optimize w such that the resulting model performs best on the test distribution, i.e.,

Here, θ(w)⋆ denotes the optimal model parameters obtained by running RLVR (as in Eq. (1)) on the mixed dataset µ(w). In practice, this optimum may not be perfectly attainable, but the formulation can be generalized to any post-training procedure that outputs an LLM model with some parameters θ using the mixed distribution µ(w).

### 2.2 Model-Based Data Mixture Strategy

To solve (2), the objective is to find the optimal data mixture strategy w for a fixed given distribution µtest. Various techniques can be used to address this problem; however, a significant challenge lies in the fact that for a fixed w, its corresponding performance Ex∈µ

Ea∼πθ(w)⋆(·|x)[r(x,a)]

test

is unknown. Estimating this performance requires an entire post-training process (solving (1)),

which makes searching through the exponentially large space ∆m computationally infeasible. To overcome this challenge, we adopt a model-based approach [20]. Specifically, we first develop

a model estimation Ltest(w) for the ground truth performance function Ltest(w) with relatively low computational cost. This estimation Ltest(w) is then used to determine the optimal w and the corresponding data mixture strategy µ(w) for RLVR post-training.

In particular, we use supervised learning to estimate the performance model Ltest(w) and then compute its corresponding optimal data mixture strategy by following these key steps:

### • Construction of the training dataset for Ltest(w). First, construct a collection {wi0}ki=1

as "seed distribution" samples. These seed distributions {wi0}ki=1 are carefully chosen to maximize information while minimizing computational cost. This selection is inspired

by the hypothesis that the different m multimodal task domains might have independent or correlated effects on the m + n testing tasks within µtest. For example, we might choose w10 = [1,0,0,0,0]⊤, w20 = [0,1,0,0,0]⊤, and w30 = [0,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25]⊤ for m = 5. Then perform k RLVR training runs to curate a collection of data {(w10,Ltest(w10)),(w20,Ltest(w20)),...}ki=1. We assume that the trained RLVR output approximates the optimal solution θ(wi0) for all {wi0}ki=1 so that we can get the exact performance Ltest(wi0) by using wi0.

### • Estimating the optimal data mixture strategy w. Using a non-linear second-order model

Ltest(w) := a + b⊤w + w⊤Cw, parameterized by a ∈ R, b ∈ Rm, and C ∈ Rm×m. This model captures both the independent (via a and b) and correlated (via C) effects of different m datasets on the performance function. The parameters {a,b,C} are estimated by minimizing the empirical risk minimization (ERM) objective using the data generated according to the seed samples:

k

i=1

where L(·,·) is a fixed loss function (e.g., RMSE).

Finally, computing the optimal weight w∗ = arg maxw∈∆

Ltest(w) and using the corresponding training data distribution µ = µ(w⋆) for RLVR post-training (i.e., solving (1)).

## 3 Experiments

We begin by describing the experimental setup, including dataset curation, reasoning mode, reward models, training and testing strategies, data sampling, and evaluation metrics in Sec. 3.1. Subsequently, Sec. 3.2 explains the design of 3 groups of data mixture strategies examined in our paper, i.e. seed, heuristic, and model-based. Finally, Sec. 3.3 presents a comprehensive analysis of the results, demonstrating the importance of data mixture in Multimodal LLM RLVR and the efficacy of different data mixture strategies.

Figure 2: Demonstration of a General QuestionAnswer Pair With and Without Reasoning.

Data Curation To expose our model to a broad range of vision-language competencies—from scientific reasoning to fine-grained visual grounding—we assemble a diverse mixture of training corpora where each dataset’s question-answer pairs are verifiable: the ground-truth answer can be deterministically checked either by exact-string comparison (for multiple-choice letters or short freeform text) or by straightforward programmatic evaluation (for numeric responses). This guarantees an unambiguous reward signal during RLVR Post-Training.

In addition to training datasets’ in-distribution test splits (if exist), we adopt out-of-distribution benchmarks that have been widely used to evaluate Multimodal LLMs [73]. Statistics for all training and evaluation sets appear in Tab. 1.

Pre-Processing of Individual Datasets (some training datasets have corresponding testing datasets):

- 1. COCO [29]: we adopt the full object-category subset used by Liu et al. [35].
- 2. LISA [23]: each image-bounding-box pair may be associated with multiple questions; we treat every question as an independent sample and shuffle the flattened list. Images whose longer side exceeds 640 pixels are resized while maintaining the aspect ratio. The same pipeline is applied to both the official train and test splits, yielding our LISA-train/test sets.
- 3. GeoQAV [26]: starting from the 8k-example math subset, we remove corrupted items by retaining only those whose answers match the expected multiple-choice regex pattern; oversized images are resized as in LISA.
- 4. SAT [52]: we use the original train split for GRPO Post-Training and val split for evaluation.
- 5. ScienceQA [37]: we keep only problems that reference an image. All answer options are concatenated with the original question into a single multiple-choice prompt, and the ground truth answer is converted to its corresponding letter label for style matching.

Reasoning Mode Rather than permitting the multimodal LLM to emit an answer immediately after observing the image-question pair, we place it in a two-step reasoning mode: (1) generate a free-form chain-of-thought, and (2) commit to a concise final answer. We trigger this mode by appending a specialised reasoning prompt to every question. Sec. 3 is an example.

Reward Models After the above steps, we extract the final answer via a regular-expression parse. ❶ Format: if the regex succeeds, this reward yields 1; otherwise, {Format, Acc, IoU} are all set to zero. ❷ Accuracy (Acc): a binary reward indicating an exact match. ❸ Intersectionover-Union (IoU): for bounding boxes, a real-valued reward in [0,1]. The specific combination of rewards applied to each training dataset is summarised in Tab. 1.

Figure 3: Model Performance before / after GRPO training on All data mixture.

Train/Test Strategy To stay within 4× NVIDIA A100 GPUS’ budget while retaining adequate representational power, we select Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct [61] as the base for our GRPO experiments. To further improve efficiency, 1 GPU runs a vLLM [22] server that handles all forward generation and periodically sync weight with other processes; the remaining GPUs execute policy update loop. Each

of 3 training GPUs processes 2 samples in parallel; 2 gradient accumulation steps give an effective batch of 12 trajectories per update. This provides the k = 6 generations needed for GRPO reward while maximizing throughput without exceeding memory limits. The vision encoder is frozen; only the LLM-part parameters are updated. We use AdamW optimizer with β1=0.9,β2=0.999,ε=10−8. The learning rate follows a linear schedule: 10% warm-up to a peak ηmax = 1 × 10−6, then linear decay to zero. Training is performed in bfloat16 with deterministic seed 42. Regarding GRPOspecific hyperparameters, we use KL coefficient 0.04, reward weights 2.0 for Acc and IoU, and 1.0 for Format. We train each experiment for 1 epoch and report metrics after 2000 steps of training. If a certain mixture training ends early, we use the last checkpoint for evaluation. We also compute metrics after 500 and 1500 steps of training for certain data mixture prediction strategies.

Training Data Sampling Let w1,...,wm denote the weights for the m available training sets, with mi=1 wi = 1. For each training step, we perform a two-stage draw: (1) sample a domain (Di) according to (Pr(Di) = wi); (2) sample 1 unseen example from the training split of (Di). This design aims to force the model to see training samples proportional to the data mixture. If all training samples from a certain dataset have been seen, the training stops.

Evaluation Metrics We compute a score in the range [0,1] for every test dataset. For LISA-test, we use the mean intersection-over-union (IoU) metric between predicted and ground-truth boxes. For all others, we use the fraction of samples where the answer exactly matches the reference as the score. To provide a concise summary of in/out-of-distribution, we additionally report 2 aggregations. ❶ In-Score: the weighted average over datasets that might be seen during training, and ❷ Out-Score: the weighted average over datasets that were not used at train time. Weights are proportional to the number of test samples in each dataset (see Tab. 1), ensuring that larger benchmarks contribute more to the overall score.

### 3.2 Data Mixture Implementation

Seed data mixture We begin with a suite of seed mixtures in which every participating dataset is equally sampled at each training step. Three variants are considered:

- • Single: train on one dataset only (αj = 1 for the chosen dataset, 0 otherwise).
- • Exclude-One: the mixtures uniformly over all but one dataset; the held-out set’s weight is 0.
- • All: a mixture uniformly over the complete collection (αi = 1/m for every dataset).

Heuristic data mixture After the seed mixture strategies, we now explore heuristic approaches that make assumptions about how each dataset impacts test performance. These data-driven strategies predict weights using empirical performance scores observed in our seed mixture experiments. We employ three heuristic methods:

- • Alpha-family: These approaches assume independence of datasets, and track each dataset’s contribution to performance with a hyperparameter α to balance In-Score and Out-Score priorities:

- – Ain (α = 1.0) / Aout (α = 0.0): Preferred for In-Score / Out-Score
- – Abal (α = 0.5): Balanced weighting between In-Score and Out-Score

- • Collinearity-Aware Regression (Coli): Employs ridge regression and assumes that variance inflation factor (VIF) correction can account for statistical dependencies between datasets.
- • Leave-One-Out Normalization (Norm): Assumes that the performance gap when a dataset is excluded compared to All is related to its importance in the final mixture.

Model-based data mixture Moving beyond heuristic approaches, we introduce a Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) framework that fits a parametric-model to approximate the mapping from data mixtures to performance scores.

After fitting empirical observations of both seed and heuristic mixture experiments, the parametric model enables the prediction of performance for any potential mixture without requiring additional empirical observations. By sampling from regions centered on observed mixtures and ranking mixtures based on model estimation, we can discover mixtures of potential that heuristic methods could not reach, particularly when complex synergies exist between datasets.

### 3.3 Evaluation Results and Analysis

We begin by showing the generalization potential of basic seed mixtures for multimodal LLM posttraining using GRPO. Next, we explore the inherent complexities of combining diverse datasets. Lastly, we justify our parametric model choice for the model-based strategy, and compare the overall efficacy of seed, heuristic, and model-based-yielded data mixtures.

Intricate Nature of Data Mixture (Figures 4 and 5). While the above seed mixture shows improvement on all test benchmarks, finding optimal data mixtures is far from straightforward. First, naive inclusion of more data does not guarantee superior results. For example, Fig. 4 shows that All’s performance on ChartQA and InfoVQA is lower than 2 single-dataset mixtures. Furthermore, Fig. 4 illustrates that each dataset might have a distinct impact on model performance. For instance, LISAonly is beneficial for generalization on InfoVQA but hurts ScienceQA score, while ScienceQA-only yields the highest score on the same-domain test set but is less useful for InfoVQA. When there’s more than one data source, the interplay between them makes the situation more complicated. Figure 5 displays this complexity by comparing All with Exclude-One mixtures. The targeted removal of certain datasets might not negatively affect, or could even enhance, performance on particular tasks or overall. For instance, the exclusion of ScienceQA significantly lowers scores on the ScienceQA and ChartQA benchmarks, while its effects elsewhere are mixed. Additionally, excluding one dataset is

consistently helpful for overall Out-Score, i.e., useful for out-domain generalization. This variability underscores the need for more intelligent and adaptive data mixture strategies.

Selection of an Effective Parametric data mixture Model (Figure 7). As the seed mixture shows promise but is likely suboptimal due to the aforementioned complexities, we investigated heuristic and model-based strategies to predict optimal data mixture. For model-based strategies, the choice of an appropriate mathematical model to approximate the function from mixture to Out-Score is crucial, as depicted in Fig. 7. A linear (1-dimensional) optimization model, for example, fails to accurately map mixture to performance outcomes even when using all samples for fitting, as evidenced by the significant deviation between "Actual" and "Predicted Scores". Similarly, an analysis using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the mixture vectors suggests that the data points are not readily separable in a linearly reduced dimensional space, further pointing to underlying non-linearities. In contrast, a quadratic optimization function is more adept. When employing cross-validation to pick top-1 out of 5 shuffles, the quadratic model (rightmost panel) demonstrates improved ability to fit the training data and, critically, to generalize to unseen test sets. We hypothesize that the advantage of using a quadratic function over 1-dimensional linear function comes from the former’s handling of the nuanced dataset interactions. Now, we adopt the quadratic paradigm to guide the search for effective data mixture.

Comparison of Mixture Strategies (Figure 6). Our investigation of data mixture strategies is summarized in Fig. 6, which presents an aggregated view of out-ofdomain scores (Out-Score), grouped by strategy. This figure shows that, as groups, the predicted data mixtures of heuristic and model-based strategies both offer advantages over naive seed mixtures by having higher median and minimum scores. This reinforces the idea that thoughtful data mixing is the key to unlocking better generalization.

Seed Heuristic Model-based

Out-Score

When comparing heuristic methods against our modelbased approach (which leverages the aforementioned quadratic optimization), the model-based strategy achieves a higher median, a higher minimum, and a competitive maximum. Moreover, the model-based approach exhibits smaller variance compared to both seed and heuristic methods, which is a sign of not only an improvement in average performance but also a gain in reliability.

RL for aligning language models. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) guides LLMs with rewards learned from human-labeled data, most visibly in InstructGPT [47]. Recent variants reduce human

effort, e.g., Constitutional AI [3], RLAIF [24], and log-likelihood-based SimPO [43], or replace value networks with groupwise comparisons (GRPO) and other verifiable-reward methods that markedly improve multi-step reasoning [4, 5, 21].

R1-style multimodal reasoning. DeepSeek-Math/R1 show that GRPO can boost textual reasoning without an explicit reward model [54]. A fast-growing line of work ports this idea to vision–language models, demonstrating domain-specific gains in math, fine-grained recognition, counting, and spatial tasks (e.g., MAYE [39], Visual-RFT [35], R1-V [7]). Follow-up studies refine rewards, curricula, and exploration strategies, achieving further stability and efficiency; yet how to allocate training across heterogeneous multimodal tasks remains open.

Data-mixture strategies. Classic multilingual pretraining up-samples rare languages with temperature sampling [13]. Proxy-model approaches such as DoReMi [64] and RegMix [33] learn mixture weights in two stages, while ODM [2] updates them online. Very recent evidence suggests that even simple heuristics rival these sophisticated schemes [18]. We extend this discussion to vision–language reasoning, treating task-level sampling as a first-class design choice.

Overall, prior studies show that (i) lightweight, verifiable rewards can reliably sharpen reasoning, and (ii) mixture policies critically shape downstream performance. Our work unifies these threads by jointly optimising data mixture and GRPO-style reinforcement for multimodal reasoning. For a full discussion, please refer to the supplementary materials Appendix A.

## 5 Conclusion

We introduced MoDoMoDo, a framework that couples multi-domain data mixtures with reinforcement learning under verifiable rewards (RLVR) for multimodal large language models. Leveraging five complementary image–text datasets equipped with rule-based reward functions, we train a lightweight quadratic surrogate to predict post-training performance as a function of the mixture distribution. This surrogate lets us identify an optimal mix after only a small set of pilot runs. Models fine-tuned with the learned mixture surpass those trained on any individual dataset or on uniform combinations.

Limitations and Future Work. Our analysis is limited to image–text settings; extending MoDoMoDo to audio, video, and 3-D modalities, as well as to tasks where verifiable signals are sparse or noisy, remains open. On the algorithmic side, exploring surrogate models that incorporate dataset similarity, curriculum schedules, or uncertainty estimates could further reduce pilot-run cost. Finally, connecting our empirical findings to a unified multi-objective RL theory would deepen understanding of why mixture-optimized RLVR generalizes so well.

## A Related Work

### A.1 Reinforcement Learning for LLM

Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has become a foundational technique for aligning LLM outputs with human preferences. Early implementations, such as InstructGPT [47], utilized Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) guided by reward models trained on human-labeled data. Subsequent approaches like Constitutional AI [3] introduced self-supervised objectives to reduce reliance on human feedback. To further minimize human involvement, Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) [24] leverages AI-generated feedback. Simplifying the RLHF pipeline, SimPO [43] replaces explicit reward models with implicit rewards derived from the model’s own log-likelihood, streamlining training while maintaining performance.

Building upon these foundations, recent research has focused on enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities through RL via verifiable rewards. DeepSeek’s R1 models [4, 28] employ Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), which eschews value networks in favor of comparing groups of outputs to reinforce correct reasoning patterns. Similarly, LaTRO [5] frames reasoning as a latent-variable optimization problem, enabling self-improvement without external feedback. [17] compare several RL algorithms (Expert Iteration, PPO, return-conditioned RL) using sparse correctness rewards or learned reward models, finding broadly similar gains in multi-step reasoning. VinePPO [21] addresses credit assignment in multi-step reasoning by utilizing unbiased Monte Carlo returns, and Xiong et al. train models to iteratively generate, verify, and refine their answers using rule-based self-rewards [65]. [19] show that a minimalistic PPO pipeline steadily increases response length and accuracy. On the systems side, VeRL [56] provides a flexible RL execution framework: it combines single- and multi-controller designs to support complex LLM training dataflows (PPO, GRPO, etc.) and reports 1.5×-20× throughput improvements over prior systems. Together, these advances demonstrate that relatively simple RL setups with rule-based correctness rewards can substantially enhance LLM reasoning when scaled effectively.

### A.2 R1-Style Multimodal Reasoning

Large language models (LLMs) are usually pre-trained for next token generation and then post-trained to follow instructions and reason. The dominant post-training recipe combines supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with RLHF, where PPO is steered by a reward model built from human judgements [48]. Recently, DeepSeek-Math [54] and DeepSeek-R1 [11] skip the costly reward model training and replace PPO with Group-Relative Policy Optimisation (GRPO), achieving stronger reasoning at lower compute. While DeepSeek-Math/R1 targeted language-only models, a wave of concurrent studies now adapts similar idea to multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to improve reasoning abilities [27, 30].

Single-domain MLLM Reasoning The first wave of multimodal R1 work asks a focused question: can GRPO turn a general-purpose MLLM into a domain specialist? Math reasoning is explored by MAYE [39], R1-OneVision [68], and Multimodal-Open-R1 [26]. Fine-grained/Open-vocabulary recognition is addressed by Visual-RFT [35] and VLM-R1 [55]. R1-V [7] targets visual counting and geometric reasoning, and VisualThinker-R1-Zero [74] pioneers spatial reasoning without any SFT warm-up [52]. Collectively, these studies demonstrate that GRPO is task-portable: by pairing a verifiable reward with a modest domain-specific corpus, one can reliably lift MLLM reasoning within that domain.

Reward engineering and algorithmic variants. Once a core stack exists, researchers turn to how the policy is optimised, devising alternative rewards, KL schedules, and curricula. OThinkMR1 [36] introduces GRPO-D, an adaptive KL penalty that balances exploration and imitation for counting and geometry. NoisyRollout [34] injects image augmentations during roll-outs to strengthen mathematical reasoning, and ThinkLite-VL [62] shows that a small but hard subset can rival large-scale runs. FAST [63] further adapts the reasoning length to task difficulty on-the-fly.

Stability, efficiency and exploration strategies. As reward designs grow more sophisticated, training can suffer from vanishing gradients and sample inefficiency, motivating techniques that explicitly stabilise and accelerate GRPO. [8] proposes normalized length reward to mitigate instability

caused by compeletion length. VL-Rethinker [60] combats gradient issues via selective sample replay and forced self-reflection, whereas LUFFY [67] blends off-policy imitation with on-policy exploration using regularised importance sampling.

Empirical analyses and large-scale deployments. A complementary thread conducts systematic ablations or scales GRPO to production-grade MLLMs, clarifying its real-world impact. VLAAThinking [6] argues that SFT alone induces “pseudo-reasoning” and that mixed-reward GRPO restores genuine logical skill; Limit-of-RLVR [72] notes that GRPO mainly lifts top-1 rather than top-k performance; and Perception-R1 [70] measures transfer to pure perception. In practice, Skywork-R1V [49] and Cosmos-Reason1 [45] add a GRPO stage to large production models, while OpenVLThinker [12] alternates SFT and GRPO over progressively harder datasets. The recipe is already migrating to video—Video-R1 [14], SEED-Bench-R1 [9] and VideoChat-R1—highlighting its modality-agnostic appeal. To track progress, new visual puzzle suites probe the logical depth of MLLMs [57, 25, 66].

Open problem. Despite the rapid proliferation of R1-style methods in MLLM Reasoning, data mixture strategies—how to allocate training resources across heterogeneous reasoning tasks—remain unexplored. Our work fills this gap and serves as a first step for future studies.

### A.3 Data Mixture for LLM

Existing approaches to mixing heterogeneous data sources for pretraining have largely fallen into two categories: language-centric up-sampling and model-guided data mixture. In the multilingual setting, BERT [13] up-samples under-represented languages by raising sampling probabilities with a temperature hyperparameter, but this often causes the lowest-resource languages to be repeated excessively. To address this imbalance problem, UniMax [10] introduces a heuristic that dynamically adjusts language weights to achieve a fairer distribution across languages. In parallel, methods such as data mixing laws [69] learn analytic functions over sample mixtures to predict model performance on unseen combinations without requiring full training runs. DoReMi [64] and RegMix [33] pursue a similar two-stage strategy: a small proxy model is first trained – via GroupDRO [53] in DoReMi or by evaluating multiple mixture configurations in RegMix – to identify optimal mixture weights, before resampling and training a full-scale model. Although effective, these proxy-based methods suffer from reduced efficiency due to multiple training passes, and the weights they learn often fail to generalize across different models. Online Data Mixing (ODM) [2] builds on DoReMi by updating data weights during full-model training, but still relies on the same underlying minimax estimation.

More recent findings suggest that even simple heuristics, such as token-count proportions [18], can outperform both manual and learned data mixture schemes, calling into question the necessity of complex weight estimation. Motivated by this insight, [18] proposes UtiliMax and Model Estimated Data Utility (MEDU), which blend lightweight utility estimates with model-informed adjustments to strike a balance between simplicity and adaptivity. While the aforementioned techniques focus primarily on monolingual or multilingual text corpora drawn from sources like Wikipedia, books, web text, and code, our study shifts attention to the domains of vision-language reasoning tasks. In these multimodal settings, dataset relationships are governed not only by raw sample frequency but also by the semantic and reasoning objectives unique to each task, necessitating novel strategies for sampling and weighting across diverse VLM reasoning benchmarks.
