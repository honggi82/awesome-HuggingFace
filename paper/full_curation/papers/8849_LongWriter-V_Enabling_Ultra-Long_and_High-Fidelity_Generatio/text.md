### Abstract

Existing Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) can process inputs with context lengths up to 128k visual and text tokens, yet they struggle to generate coherent outputs beyond 1,000 words. We find that the primary limitation is the absence of long output examples during supervised fine-tuning (SFT). To tackle this issue, we introduce LongWriter-V22k, a SFT dataset comprising 22,158 examples, each with multiple input images, an instruction, and corresponding outputs ranging from 0 to 10,000 words. Moreover, to achieve long outputs that maintain high-fidelity to the input images, we employ Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to the SFT model. Given the high cost of collecting human feedback for lengthy outputs (e.g., 3,000 words), we propose IterDPO, which breaks long outputs into segments and uses iterative corrections to form preference pairs with the original outputs. Additionally, we develop MMLongBench-Write, a benchmark featuring six tasks to evaluate the long-generation capabilities of VLMs. Our 7B parameter model, trained with LongWriter-V22k and IterDPO, achieves impressive performance on this benchmark, outperforming larger proprietary models like GPT-4o.

### 1 Introduction

Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have significantly enhanced their capabilities in processing visual and textual inputs (Alayrac et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2024). Notably, there have been substantial breakthroughs in the long-context capabilities of VLMs (Xue et al., 2024; Shu et al., 2024). For instance, Qwen2VL (Wang et al., 2024a) can now understand videos up to 20 minutes, with a context window of 32k tokens. This progress has significantly expanded the scope of tasks that VLMs can handle, making them more applicable to real-world scenarios.

*Equal contribution.

However, despite the increased input context window, the effective output length of VLMs remains limited. To verify this limitation, we collect a benchmark comprising six tasks that require VLMs to generate long texts based on visual inputs (as shown in Figure 1). By adjusting the required output length in the instructions, we found that all existing models struggle to generate outputs exceeding 1,000 words (Section 2). In real-world scenarios, such long-output queries are common user demands (Chou et al., 2024). For example, (1) creative writing tasks may require generating detailed stories or essays based on visual prompts (Hong

- et al., 2023), and (2) professional writing tasks may involve writing comprehensive reports or analyses from visual data (Hartsock and Rasool, 2024). To meet these practical needs, it is essential to enhance the long-output capabilities of VLMs.

To investigate the reasons behind the limited long-output capability of VLMs, we are inspired by the LongWriter (Bai et al., 2024), which adjusts the output length distribution of the supervised finetuning (SFT) data to observe changes in model output length. Our experiments revealed that the proportion of long-output examples in the SFT data determines the model’s output length. This finding explains why VLMs typically have an output length limit of around 1,000 words. Existing visual instruction tuning datasets (Schuhmann et al., 2022), such as LLaVA (Liu et al., 2024a), mainly contain tasks like grounding (Liu et al., 2024b) and caption generation (Wang et al., 2022), with most outputs being less than 300 words (Lin et al., 2014).

To fill the gap, we select long-output instructionimage pairs from MMEvol (Luo et al., 2024) as inputs. In addition to single-image inputs, we also constructed other forms of data, including multiimage inputs and backtranslated instructions (Wang

- et al., 2024b), to enrich the diversity of the input data. To generate long outputs, we propose a planand-write approach: LongWriter-Agent-V. This

method involves providing input images and writing instructions to GPT-4o to first generate an outline and then sequentially write the text in segments. Through this approach, we collect LongWrite-V22k, a dataset of 22k long-output examples.

Using LongWrite-V-22k for SFT, the output length of Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct (Team, 2025) can be extended beyond 3,000 words. However, longer outputs often introduce issues such as repetition and hallucination (Favero et al., 2024). To improve the fidelity of long outputs, we adapted the approach from RLHF-V (Yu et al., 2024a), where human experts revise the model’s outputs to form preference pairs for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Since traditional DPO (Rafailov et al., 2024) is typically performed on short texts of around 300 words, and LongWriter-V’s output length can exceed 3,000 words, the annotation cost is extremely high. To enhance the efficiency of preference data utilization, we proposed IterDPO, which divides long outputs into N segments, treating each segment’s revision as a preference pair. This method allows the model to learn fine-grained human corrections for each segment and effectively multiplies the use of a single long-output preference pair by N times. Through LongWriter-V-22k SFT and IterDPO, our 7B model achieves impressive performance in both output length and quality, surpassing powerful VLMs like GPT-4o.

In summary, our contributions are as follows:

• We construct MMLongBench-Write to evaluate the long-output capabilities of VLMs and find that the output length limit of existing

VLMs is around 1,000 words.

- • We collect the SFT dataset LongWrite-V-22k, enabling VLMs for 3,000+ word generation.
- • We propose IterDPO, which effectively improves the text quality of long-output VLM.

### 2 Preliminaries

In the preliminary experiments, we first collect MMLongBench-Write, a benchmark with visual inputs and long-output requirements. Then, we conduct an evaluation on this benchmark to explore the maximum output length of VLMs. Besides, we reveal that the main reason for bounded output length lies in the length distribution of SFT data.

MMLongBench-Write. The ability to write long texts based on visual inputs is a fundamental skill in various real-world applications and can be broadly categorized into professional writing and creative writing, depending on whether specialized knowledge is required (Taavitsainen and Pahta, 2000). To evaluate how well that VLMs master the two skills, we design three specific tasks for each skill. For each task, we curate 20 representative instructions with input images as test data. To ensure diversity, half instructions are in English and half are in Chinese. Figure 1 shows six examples of the benchmark and data distribution. It highlights that professional writing tasks typically involve more input images and require longer output lengths.

LongWrite-V-Ruler. To explore the maximum output length of VLMs, we select 8 examples from MMLongBench-Write benchmark, with four

samples in English and four in Chinese. As depicted in Figure 1, each instruction is in the form of "Write an L-word article for the given pictures". We construct a diverse test set by changing the length requirement L. This test set uses L ∈ {500,1000,2000,4000}, which consists of 32 test prompts in total.

Evaluation Result. We conduct the LongWrite-VRuler test on three open-source VLMs and three proprietary models. In Figure 2, we plot the required output length (x-axis) and the corresponding average output length (y-axis) for 12 instructions. We can observe that there exists an upper bound of 1000 output length for all models.

Preliminary Experiment. As the controlled experiments in LongWriter (Bai et al., 2024) has revealed that the maximum output length of LLM is correlated with the maximum output length of SFT data, we further explore how the average output length of SFT data can influence the long-generation capabilities of VLM. We fine-tune Qwen2-VL-7BInstruct (Wang et al., 2024a) on three visual instruction datasets sampled from our final SFT data. Each dataset has 10k examples with different average output length respectively (0.8k, 1.8k and 2.8k).

- Figure 3 shows the trained models’ performance on LongWrite-V-Ruler, we observe that the model’s maximum output length increases with the average output length of SFT data. Besides, we find that the number of long-output examples is crucial for extending the output length of VLMs. For example, the training set with an average length of

kens (orange line). In contrast, the model trained with 21% data exceeding 4k output length is able to do that (blue line). This result indicates that the main reason that limits the VLM’s output length is lack of enough long-output examples in SFT data.

3 LongWriter-V: Data and Training

In this section, we will introduce the data collection and training process for unlocking the long generation capability of vision-language models.

3.1 Data Collection

- Figure 4 depicts the overall pipeline of our data collection process, which consists of two phases: SFT and DPO data collection.

##### 3.1.1 SFT Data Collection

Existing VLMs fail to directly generate texts exceeding 1k tokens, so we develop a two-stage method to generate long texts as SFT data.

LongWrite Agent-V. Before introducing our method, we first formalize the task’s objective. Given several input images v and an user instruction x, our goal is to generate a text y∗ that aligned with user’s length and quality requirements:

y∗ = arg max

(sl(y) + sq(y))Pθ(y|v,x) (1)

y

where sl and sq is the scoring function for judging the length and quality of the output, respectively.

Pθ is the function representing the end-to-end solution, while existing VLMs may not be directly applied as their maximum output lengths are below 1k. To utilize off-the-shelf VLMs, we propose

- Figure 4: SFT and DPO data collection pipeline of LongWriter-V. The SFT data includes both single-image and multi-image input for long text output. The DPO data contains human revision over each paragraph of VLM’s long output. We conduct iterative direct preference optimization to learn the fine-grained human feedback.

a two-stage method for generating long texts. Inspired by the plan-and-write method from LongWriter (Bai et al., 2024), we first prompt the VLM to generate an outline o that structures the output, plans the content, and specifies the word count for each paragraph. This outline breaks down the complex long-output task into manageable sub-tasks. Next, we use the VLM to fill in each paragraph and concatenate them to form the final output:

y∗ = arg max

P1(o|v,x)arg max

(sl(y)+sq(y))P2

(2) P2(y|v,x,o) =

p(yi|v,x,oi,y<i) (3)

where P1 is the modeling function for first stage, which takes input images and instruction to write an n-paragraph outline o = {oi,i = 1,...,n}. P2 refers to the second stage, where the VLM outputs the content yi paragraph by paragraph based on the input information, outline oi and previous paragraphs y<i. In practice, we design two detailed prompts for guiding VLM to implement the two

stages, which are listed in Appendix B.2.

Visual Instruction Collection. To collect longoutput visual instructions for SFT, we choose MMEvol (Luo et al., 2024) as our primary data source. MMEvol is a large-scale, opendomain dataset containing 480k image-text instruction pairs, sourced from diverse datasets such as LLaVA-Instruct (Liu et al., 2024a) and ShareGPT4V (Chen et al., 2024a). However, the average output length in this dataset is relatively short (54.85 tokens), necessitating a filtering process to identify long-output instructions. We first check the original response length of e ach example and select those with output length over 128, yielding 55,835 valid data. Next, we utilized GPT-4o to verify whether each instruction genuinely requires a long output and whether the associated image was sufficiently relevant to the instruction. Finally, we get 8,115 single-image instructions.

Multi-image Instruction Generation. As the original data in MMEvol only has one image for each instruction, we synthesize some multi-image instructions to increase the diversity of SFT data.

We select three subsets of MMEvol: wikiart, weblandmark, web-celebrity. Each subset contains hundreds of images in the same category. For example, images in web-landmark are all landmark pictures taken from different world attractions. We randomly sample 2 or 4 same-category images and then ask gpt-4o to generate an instruction that require long output for these images. We obtain 6,313 multi-image instructions in this way. Apart from synthetic data, we also collect natural multi-image data from an open-source PPT dataset, Zenodo10K (Zheng et al., 2025). We transform these slides into images to use them as visual inputs and set the instruction as "Write a lecture script for these slides". We choose those slides that has at least 2 pages and at most 30 pages, resulting in 7,730 data. Backtranslation. Through above processes, we collect 22,158 single-image and multi-image instructions in total. Using the LongWrite AgentV pipeline, we generate long output for each visual instruction as SFT data. We call this training data LongWrite-V-22k. But most instructions don’t specify the exact word count requirement, models trained on these data may lack the ability to follow the writing instruction with word count requirements. Therefore, we sample 5,000 data from LongWrite-V-22k and calculate the length of the output L then add a requirement "Please write L-word in total." to the end of the instruction and use gpt-4o-mini for rephrasing the instruction to maintain consistency. This is inspired by previous backtranslation (Li et al., 2023) method on training long-output LLMs (Pham et al., 2024).

##### 3.1.2 DPO Data Collection

The SFT data aims to extend VLMs’ output length. But the longer outputs may bring more hallucinations and repetitions. So the follow up question is: how to improve the generation fidelity of long output VLM? Previous works often adapt direct preference optimization (Rafailov et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2024c) to correct the hallucinations of VLMs. We follow the data format in RLHF-V (Yu et al., 2024a) which utilizes the human-annotated segment-level corrections on VLM’s outputs as feedback.

VLM Output Collection. To collect long responses, we select 100 slides that were not included in LongWrite-V-22k for VLM to generate scripts. These slides were previously used for teaching on MOOC platforms (Yu et al., 2020) and cover 10 subjects such as Computer Science, Math and Physics. Each subject may contain 4 to 16

slides and each slide may have 10 to 30 pages. We use LongWriter-V-7B, the VLM trained on our SFT data, to generate scripts for each slide. The long scripts are segmented by sections and aligned with each page of the given slide. We find that LongWriter-V-7B tends to output fewer sections than the number of total pages, which is one of the issues that we would ask human annotators to fix. Human Revision Collection. To get high-quality feedback on the flawed output of SFT model, we hire 10 college students from 10 different majors corresponding to the subjects of our slides. We required annotators to have a GPA above 3.8 to ensure their expertise. To facilitate the annotation process, we build an online platform (See Appendix C.1). Each annotator will get slides that match with their major.The platform displays each slide page alongside the corresponding script segment generated by the SFT model. We ask annotators to check and revise each page’s script for the following error types: factual errors, missing information, relevance to the image, coherence of sentences, and repetition of words. After completing the annotation of a slide, our authors will review the annotation quality. Ultimately, we get 72 valid scripts with fine-grained human corrections.

##### 3.2 Training

Supervised Fine-tuning. We conduct model training based on two open-source VLMs with different parameter sizes: Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct (Team, 2025). We choose Qwen2.5-VL series as base model because they support a context window of 32k tokens. By resizing the input image’s width and height to 280x280, the Qwen2.5-VL models can process up to 30 images. As shown in Figure 5, the output length in LongWrite-V-22k are distributed between 0 and 10k with two peaks around 0 and 1.5k. The

peak at 0 indicates some short output data is mixed in the LongWrite-V-22k, which are mainly the results of those simple instructions. To get a better length distribution, we sample 10k data from LongWrite-V-22k with an average output length of

- 2.8k as training data. We then fine-tune the two models for 3 epochs with a learning rate of 1e-5 for Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct and 7e-6 for Qwen2.5VL-72B-Instruct, resulting in two SFT models: LongWriter-V-7B and LongWriter-V-72B. Iterative Direct Preference Optimization. After SFT phase, DPO (Rafailov et al., 2024) is a widelyused method to optimize VLM’s output quality, which learns from a dataset of preference pairs D = {(v,x,yw,yl)}, where the winning output yw is preferred over the losing output yl given the same visual input v and text input x. The optimization objective of DPO is to maximize the difference between likelihood of preference pairs:

LDPO(πθ;πref) = −E(v,x,yw,yl)∼D [log σ(β log

πθ(yw|v,x) πref(yw|v,x) − β log

πθ(yl|v,x) πref(yl|v,x)

)]

(4) In our annotation process, v represents the images of a slide, x is the instruction for generating scripts, yl is the flawed output script of VLM and yw is the slide’s lecture after human revision. However, collecting human feedback on long output is very time-consuming and expensive. As mentioned in Section 3.1.2, we gather 72 preference pairs on the scripts, which costs one week and around 1,000 $ to finish. To make most use of these data, we propose to iteratively learn the fine-grained human correctional feedback on the long output. As the yw = {ywi ,i = 1,...N} is a revised script for an N page slide, we increasingly view each page’s script ywi as a winning segment over the flawed script:

N

LIterDPO(πθ; πref) = −E(v,x,yw,yl)∼D

i=1

πθ(yl≤i|v≤i, x) πref(yl≤i|v≤i, x)

πθ(yw≤i|v≤i, x) πref(yw≤i|v≤i, x)

− β log

[log σ(β log

)]

(5)

where yw≤i, yl≤i is the revised and unrevised scripts until page i, and v≤i are the corresponding images. We view yw≤i as a new wining response over the flawed output yl≤i, this can help VLM learn the fine-grained feedback on the long output and extend the number preference pairs for N times. In this way, we get 1,477 iterative pairs for training. Apart from human feedback, we also utilize AI

feedback by employing the gpt4o as the reward model. Following RLAIF (Yu et al., 2024b), we sample responses from the SFT model for 1,367 long-output instructions and use GPT-4o for assigning length and quality scores for the responses to construct preference pairs. Our final DPO model is trained with 2,844 mixed preference pairs,

### 4 Experiments

##### 4.1 Experimental Setup

Metric. Following Bai et al. (2024), we evaluate the VLM’s output length and quality using two metrics: Sl and Sq. Sl is the output score that measures how close that the VLM’s output length lv is to the required length lr:

 

100 · max 0,1 − (lv/l3r−1) if lv > lr, 100 · max 0,1 − (lr/l2v−1) if lv ≤ lr.

Sl =



(6) We also use gpt-4o-2024-08-06 to assign the quality score Sq for six aspects: Relevance, Accuracy, Coherence, Clarity, Breadth and Depth, and Reading Experience. We list the scoring prompt in Appendix D. Note that we have asked gpt-4o not to take the output length into account so that the quality score is independent with the length score. The overall score S is the mean of Sl and Sq.

Baselines. We evaluate 3 proprietary VLMs, 3 open-source VLMs and 4 LLMs on MMLongBench-Write (model details about models are listed in Table 3). Given that LLMs can also process visual instructions via reading the image caption (Ma et al., 2024), we first use gpt-4o to describe the input images and then feed the caption and writing instruction to the LLM.

##### 4.2 Main Results

We report the performance of baselines and our trained models in Table 1. To study the effective output length of models, we divide the MMLongBench-Write benchmark into four subsets based on the instruction’s required word count: 01500 words, 1500-2000 words, 2000-3000 words, and over 3000 words. The highest length and quality scores for each subset among models are in bold. We have three observations on the results: (1) Most existing models struggle to satisfy the length requirement over 2000 words, while LongWriter-V models can generate enough words for such instructions. By checking the length score Sl across different length intervals, we find that most models

perform poorly on the [2000, 3000) range, with their Sl below 70. In contrast, our LongWriter-V models can generate outputs with effective length and high quality even on the range of [3000, 4000). (2) The scaling law effect on our benchmark is striking: smaller models like Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct perform poorly in our evaluation with an overall score of 54.4, while its larger counterpart Qwen2.5VL-72B-Instruct achieves a notably higher score of 83.3. Besides, after training the two VLMs on our LongWrite-V-22k data, both models improve significantly on long generation. The performance gap between the two sizes’ models is narrowed after SFT (LongWriter-V-7B’s 81.8 vs. LongWriter-V-72B’s 84.9). (3) DPO can improve both the VLM’s output quality and the ability to follow the length requirements of long generation. LongWriter-V-7B-DPO, which is the model trained on LongWriter-V-7B with 2,844 preference pairs, achieves improvement on both Sl (+3.7) and Sq (+1.8), showing that DPO is effective for boosting the long generation capabilities of VLMs.

- 4.3 Human Evaluation As the quality score Sq is assigned by the GPT-

- 4o automatically, the evaluation results may have bias as LLM tends to favor the responses generated by itself (Wang et al., 2023; Li et al., 2024a). To get a more fair quality comparison for the mod-

els, we conduct a human evaluation to capture the actual human preferences on model responses. Specifically, we select responses from four models: the three models trained by us and the GPT4o-2024-08-06 baseline. We ask two human annotators to vote for their preferred response between two selected models on the 120 responses of MMLongBench-Write. For each annotator, we collect 720 votes and calculate the average win rate among models using two annotators’ feedback.

The results are shown in Figure 6, where we surprisingly find that two of our trained models receive more votes from humans in the comparison with the GPT-4o-2024-08-06 baseline. While in the automatic quality score comparison, the two models also surpass the GPT-4o on the quality score. This indicates that our trained models have gained some advantages over the GPT-4o baseline in the human preference, which is consistent with the automatic evaluation on the quality score of responses.

##### 4.4 Ablation Study

We conduct ablation experiments on both the SFT and DPO process of LongWriter-V models. For the LongWriter-V-7B model trained on LongWriteV-22k data, we control the three data sources of LongWrite-V-22k to observe how they contribute to the final performance of the SFT model. We run the SFT process on Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct with-

out (w/o) single-image, multi-image or backtranslation data respectively and evaluate the trained models on MMLongBench-Write. As shown in Table 2, removing any of these data sources may lead to a decline in the overall score, where multi-image data is the most essential one, causing a decrease of 15.3 overall score. These results indicate that these sources are useful for training long output VLMs.

To explore the effectiveness of our iterative DPO strategy over the small size preference data on longoutput VLM alignment, we run the DPO process without those extra pairs extended by the iterative strategy. Results in Table 2 demonstrates that the model gains +1.1 length score but -1.1 quality score and -2.5 PPT task score over the DPO model with full data, which means the extended data is useful for the generation quality and the PPT script task. To examine the effectiveness of mixing AI preference pairs, we then train the SFT model with the human revised preference pairs only, resulting in a even worse performance (-1.1 overall score against the SFT model). This suggests that incorporating AI-generated pairs can improve model performance by providing additional training signals.

### 5 Related Work

Recent advancements in Vision-Language Models have focused on enhancing their ability to process long-context inputs (Ge et al., 2024; Li et al., 2024b; Chen et al., 2024c). There are abundant benchmarks and datasets that designed for multimodal long context understanding including MMLongBench-Doc (Ma et al., 2024), Long-

DocURL (Deng et al., 2024), LongViTU (Wu et al., 2025), ShareGPT4Video (Chen et al., 2024b), LongVideoBench (Wu et al., 2024a) and LVBench (Wang et al., 2024c). However, the longoutput generation abilities of VLMs have been less explored. In our work, we find that current VLMs struggle to generate an output with over 1000 tokens, which is much shorter than their max input context length (>16,000 tokens) (Wang et al., 2024a). To fill this gap, we explore how to extend the maximum output length of VLMs.

Although we show that supervised fine-tuning can align VLMs with user’s instructions on length requirements, it is also important to improve the quality of long output (Wu et al., 2024b). Previous works mainly focus on how to improve VLMs’ generation quality on short output tasks via post training methods such as RLHF-V (Yu et al., 2024a), RLAIF-V (Yu et al., 2024b), POVID (Zhou et al., 2024) and MIA-DPO (Liu et al., 2024c). However, none of these methods have explored how to effectively use human correctional feedback on long output for aligning VLMs. We propose to iteratively use each segment of the revised long output as the preferred response, which extends the number of preference pairs and successfully improves the long generation quality of VLM.

### 6 Conclusion

Our work introduces MMLongBench-Write, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating long-generation tasks with visual inputs, and LongWriter-V-22k, a novel supervised fine-tuning dataset designed to enhance the long-output capabilities of VLMs. Furthermore, our proposed IterDPO method effectively leverages human feedback to improve the fidelity of long outputs, addressing issues such as hallucination. Future

research may explore more efficient training strategies and larger datasets to further push the boundaries of long-output generation in VLMs.

### Limitations

We acknowledge some limitations in our work, which are listed below: 1. Dataset Size: The size of our LongWriter-V-22k dataset may not be sufficiently large to fully capture the diversity of longoutput generation tasks. While this dataset size is adequate for initial exploration and training, it may limit the robustness of our findings and the generalizability of our model’s performance. Expanding the dataset to include more examples would require significant additional resources, both in terms of data collection and annotation costs. 2. Language Limitation: The current dataset and benchmark are limited to English and Chinese only. This restricts our ability to evaluate the performance of VLMs across multiple languages, which is crucial for real-world applications where multilingual support is often required. Future work should consider expanding the dataset to include other languages to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of VLMs’ long-output capabilities. 3. Human Feedback Efficiency: While our IterDPO method significantly improves the efficiency of utilizing human feedback for long outputs, the process of collecting high-quality human corrections remains time-consuming and costly. This limits the scalability of our approach and the frequency with which we can update and refine the training data. Future work should explore more efficient methods for obtaining and incorporating human feedback to further enhance model performance.

### Ethical Consideration

While our work on enhancing the long-output capabilities of Vision-Language Models represents a significant advancement, VLMs may still generate inaccurate or misleading information, especially when dealing with common knowledge not explicitly present in the context. This can lead to the propagation of false information if not properly managed. Therefore, additional safeguards and verification mechanisms should be implemented when deploying these models in user-facing applications.

Our training data has been desensitized to protect individual privacy. All the data sources we used are public available with permissible licenses, including MMEvol (Luo et al., 2024) and Zen-

odo10K (Zheng et al., 2025).

### C Annotation Details

##### C.1 Annotation Platform

Our annotation platform consists of two main pages: annotation page and admin page.

Annotation page. This page provides the core annotation interface for users. As shown in Figure 7, after logging in, users first see a course selection interface where they can view available courses in their major. Each course is displayed with a progress bar showing completion status and the total number of annotated pages. After selecting a course, users enter the annotation interface shown in Figure 8, where the page is divided into three columns: the lecture slide, original transcript, and annotation area. Users can navigate through slides using pagination controls and save their annotations for each slide individually.

Admin page. This page provides administrative oversight of the annotation process. As shown in Figure 9, administrators can monitor annotation progress across all majors and courses, with detailed statistics grouped by annotator’s major. The interface displays progress bars and completion rates for each course, helping administrators track the overall project status. When reviewing annotations, administrators can examine both original and modified scripts side by side, as shown in Figure 10.

[Figure 30]

- C.2 Annotation Guidelines Guidelines for the data annotators:

- 1. Click on “Register” in the left bottom part of the annotation page if this is the first time that you enter our system. You should choose your major, username and password during registration. We will assign annotation tasks according to your major. You can return to the annotation page and login via your username and password.
- 2. After logging in, you will see a list of PPTs that require modifications to the presentation scripts. Click on “Start Annotating” to proceed.
- 3. After opening a PPT, you will see the original script for each slide. These scripts are generated by AI and may have issues such as factual errors, missing information from the PPT, irrelevance to the topic, awkward phrasing, or repetitive wording. Your task is to edit the script for each slide in the "Annotation Area." After making your changes, click on "Save Annotations."
- 4. Note that this is a one-way system. If you press the browser’s back button, the login process will restart (there are only three pages: login, list, and annotation). If you want to return to the list page from the annotation page, you can click on "Return to Course List" at the top. Remember to save your annotations promptly after completing them! Click "Save Annotations" immediately after finishing your annotations! If the PPT is not clear enough, you can use the button at the top-right corner of the image to enlarge it to full screen.
- 5. If you have finished marking a PPT, you can contact us for acceptance inspection. We will check each page for the following:

- - Whether there are factual errors.
- - Whether too much information from the PPT is missing in the script.
- - Whether the content is irrelevant to the topic.
- - Whether the sentences are awkward or not smooth.
- - Whether there is repetitive wording.

- 6. Compensation:

##### Response of GPT-4o-2024-08-06:

Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to today’s lecture on Mechanical Energy. Our focus will be on understanding the fundamental concepts of kinetic energy, potential energy, and the roles of air resistance and friction. These concepts are not just theoretical; they have practical implications in our daily lives, especially in the context of transportation. Let’s begin by considering the significance of transportation in energy consumption. In the United States, transportation accounts for approximately 28% of total energy use, which translates to about 30 exajoules per year. This sector also contributes to one-third of the country’s CO2 emissions. Understanding the mechanics behind transportation can help us devise strategies to reduce energy use and emissions. First, let’s delve into kinetic energy, which is the energy of motion. The formula for kinetic energy is Ekin = 21mv2, where m is mass and v is velocity. Consider a baseball thrown at 100 mph; its kinetic energy is around 150 joules. While this is a small amount of energy, it illustrates the concept effectively. Now, imagine a car like a Toyota Camry with four passengers moving at 60 mph. The kinetic energy here is approximately 700 kilojoules, demonstrating how energy scales with mass and velocity. Let’s explore a practical example: a road trip from Boston to New York, a distance of 210 miles. Suppose the car in question achieves 30 miles per gallon and consumes 7 gallons of fuel for the trip, equating to 840 megajoules of energy. However, not all this energy is used for motion. The kinetic energy required is only about 0.7 megajoules. So, where does the rest of the energy go? Factors like engine efficiency, air resistance, and friction play significant roles. Next, we’ll explore potential energy, which is stored energy based on an object’s position or configuration. A fundamental principle here is energy conservation: energy cannot be created or destroyed,

only transformed. Consider a ball rolling uphill; kinetic energy is converted into potential energy. The potential energy, U, is given by U = mgh, where g is the acceleration due to gravity, and h is height. Springs are another example, where potential energy is stored as U = 12kx2. Now, let’s consider potential energy in the context of forces and work. For a mass subject to a force, the work done is the force multiplied by the distance moved. This work results in energy transfer, such as converting potential energy to kinetic energy. In vector terms, for motion in a line, force is related to potential energy by F = −dUdx . Let’s apply these concepts to real-world scenarios. Consider an airplane cruising at altitude; its kinetic energy is significant. But potential energy also plays a crucial role, especially at high altitudes. Other applications include using potential energy to pump water uphill or using elevators and cranes. Returning to our road trip example, we must consider the potential energy effects of hills. A constant speed of 60 mph with elevation gains requires additional energy. Suppose the car gains 50 feet per mile; the energy needed per hill becomes substantial. Despite this, the total energy for hills remains less than the energy output from the engine, highlighting the inefficiency of energy conversion in transportation. Air resistance and friction are also critical factors in energy consumption. As a car moves, it collides with air molecules, creating a wake. This interaction results in energy loss, calculated using the drag coefficient. For example, a Toyota Camry traveling from Boston to New York loses a considerable amount of energy to air resistance. The drag force depends on factors like speed and surface area, and reducing these can improve efficiency. Finally, let’s summarize our findings. The total energy expenditure for our road trip includes kinetic energy, potential energy of hills, rolling resistance, and air resistance. The gasoline energy far exceeds these values, illustrating the inefficiency of internal combustion engines, which are only about 25% efficient. This inefficiency is even more pronounced in city driving, where acceleration and rolling resistance dominate. To reduce transport energy costs, we can apply simple physics principles. Driving at lower speeds, streamlining vehicles, inflating tires, using more efficient engines, and employing regenerative braking are effective strategies. In an ideal world, with these measures and advanced technologies like vacuum tunnels, we could drastically reduce transport energy expenditure. In conclusion, understanding mechanical energy, particularly in transportation, provides insights into improving energy efficiency and reducing environmental impact. As we continue to innovate and apply these principles, we move closer to a more sustainable future. Thank you for your attention. Please review your lecture notes in preparation for our next topic: Heat.

- 2. Building on our introduction to mechanical energy, let’s examine its pivotal role in transportation. The U.S. dedicates around 28% of its energy to this sector, which consumes approximately 30 exajoules annually and accounts for a third of the country’s CO2 emissions. This underscores the necessity for sustainable practices. To tackle these challenges, we must understand kinetic and potential energy, as well as friction and air resistance. Kinetic energy is the energy of motion, while potential energy is stored energy with the potential to perform work.

- optimizing transportation systems. As we delve deeper, consider how these principles can inform innovations in energy conservation and efficiency, driving progress toward a more sustainable future.
- 3. Let’s delve into kinetic energy, the energy a moving object possesses. The formula for kinetic energy is Ekin = 12mv2, where m represents mass and v represents velocity. This equation reveals that kinetic energy is proportional to an object’s mass and the square of its speed. Consider a baseball traveling at 100 mph. Its kinetic energy is approximately 150 joules. Now, think about a Camry carrying four passengers moving at 60 mph; its kinetic energy jumps to around 700 kilojoules. This comparison illustrates how both mass and velocity significantly affect kinetic energy. To further clarify, let’s examine the energy needed for 100 pitches of a baseball.

As we proceed, consider how these principles apply to real-world scenarios and how they can inform innovations in energy efficiency and sustainability.

- 4. Let’s delve into a real-world application of energy principles by considering a road trip from Boston to New York in a Camry with four passengers. This 210-mile journey requires about 7 gallons of gasoline, equating to roughly 840 megajoules of energy. But where does this energy go? Firstly, kinetic energy is a factor; a 4000-pound car at 60 mph possesses about 0.7 megajoules of kinetic energy. Yet, this is a small portion of the total energy used. We must also consider the engine’s efficiency, typically around 25%, meaning much of the energy is lost as heat. Moreover, friction and air resistance play significant roles. These forces oppose the car’s motion, necessitating additional energy to maintain speed. Climbing hills further increases energy demands, converting kinetic energy into potential energy. This scenario prompts us to question the necessity of such energy expenditures. Are there ways to optimize our vehicles and driving habits to enhance efficiency? Reflect on how understanding these principles can lead to more sustainable practices in transportation. By grasping where energy is utilized and wasted, we can explore innovative solutions to reduce consumption and environmental impact.
- 5. Now, let’s turn our attention to potential energy, a fundamental idea in physics. It represents stored energy within a system, ready to perform work. The principle of energy conservation is key here: energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed from one form to another. Consider lifting an object; as it ascends, its kinetic energy converts into potential energy, expressed as U = mgh, where m is mass, g is gravitational acceleration, and h is height. This potential energy can revert to kinetic energy if the object falls. A practical example is a compressed spring. The energy you expend to compress it becomes potential energy, U = 12kx2, with k as the spring constant and x as the displacement. When released, this energy transforms back into kinetic energy. Understanding potential energy is vital for analyzing systems and predicting motion. It enables us to calculate energy transformations and optimize processes, from elevators to water pumps. Reflect on how these concepts apply to everyday technologies and how they might inspire innovations in energy storage and efficiency.

- 6. Building on our understanding of potential energy, let’s explore its relationship with forces and work. When an object is displaced in a potential field, like gravity or a spring, a force acts upon it.

This force is derived from the potential energy gradient, expressed as F = −dUdx , where U is potential energy and x is position.

Work is done when a force moves an object over a distance, quantified as W = F × d. In the context of potential energy, this work equates to the change in potential energy, ∆U. For instance, lifting an object increases its gravitational potential energy, while compressing a spring increases its elastic potential energy. These concepts are crucial in physics, as they enable us to analyze and predict system behavior. By understanding the forces and work involved, we can optimize energy use in various applications, from

designing efficient machines to developing renewable energy systems. Consider how these principles apply to real-world scenarios and inspire innovations in energy efficiency and sustainability.

- 7. Expanding on our discussion, let’s delve into potential energy in two and three dimensions using vectors. In 2D and 3D spaces, potential energy becomes a function of multiple variables, such as U(x,y,z). The gradient of potential energy, denoted as ∇U, is a vector that points in the direction of the greatest increase in potential energy. The force acting on an object can be derived from this gradient, expressed as F = −∇U. The negative sign indicates that the force acts in the direction of decreasing potential energy. For example, in a gravitational field, the potential energy is given by U = −GMmr , where G is the gravitational constant, M and m are masses, and r is the distance between them. The corresponding force is F = −∇U = −GMmr2 ˆr, which is the familiar inverse-square law of gravity. Understanding these vector relationships is essential for analyzing complex systems, such as planetary motion or electromagnetic interactions. It allows us to predict and explain the behavior of objects under various forces, inspiring innovations in fields like robotics and aerospace engineering. Reflect on how these principles apply to real-world technologies and consider their potential to drive future advancements.

- 8. Let’s delve into the practical applications of potential energy, beginning with aircraft. At cruising altitude, a 747 carries substantial potential energy, calculated as U = mgh, where m is the aircraft’s mass, g is gravitational acceleration, and h is its height. For a 747 at 40,000 feet, this equates to about 41 gigajoules. Potential energy is also pivotal in energy storage systems. Pumped-storage hydroelectricity is a prime example, where water is pumped uphill to a reservoir during off-peak hours. When demand rises, the water is released to generate electricity, effectively converting stored potential energy into kinetic energy, which then powers turbines. In urban settings, potential energy is harnessed in elevators and cranes. Elevators utilize counterweights to minimize energy consumption during vertical movement, while cranes employ potential energy to lift heavy loads efficiently. These examples underscore the significance of potential energy in modern engineering and its role in sustainable energy solutions. Reflect on how these principles can inspire innovations in energy efficiency and storage, contributing to a greener future.
- 9. Let’s revisit our road trip scenario to delve into the role of potential energy. Even though Boston and New York are at sea level, the journey between them involves elevation changes that significantly impact energy consumption. As you ascend hills, your vehicle converts kinetic energy into potential energy, stored due to increased height. This process demands extra energy, which is then partly recovered as you descend, converting potential energy back into kinetic energy. However, not all energy is recaptured due to losses from friction and air resistance. Understanding these dynamics is vital for optimizing vehicle efficiency. By analyzing elevation profiles, we can better predict energy requirements and improve fuel economy. This knowledge not only enhances road trip efficiency but also informs the development of smarter navigation systems and more fuel-efficient vehicles. Consider how these principles might be applied to other modes of transport, such as trains or ships, to reduce energy usage and environmental impact. Reflect on potential innovations that could further minimize energy loss, contributing to sustainable transportation solutions.
- 10. To estimate the energy impact of hills during a road trip, consider a car traveling at a steady 60 mph, encountering a 50-foot elevation gain per mile. This incline necessitates additional energy to elevate the vehicle, calculated using the potential energy formula U = mgh, where m is the car’s mass, g is gravitational acceleration, and h is the height increase. For a 1800 kg car, the energy required to climb each hill is approximately 260 kJ. Over a 210-mile trip, this accumulates to about 27 MJ. However, descending the hills doesn’t fully recover this energy

- due to energy losses from braking and friction. These calculations highlight the significant energy demands of hilly terrains. By understanding these dynamics, we can develop strategies to optimize fuel efficiency, such as using regenerative braking systems to capture energy during descents. Reflect on how this knowledge can inform route planning and vehicle design to enhance efficiency and sustainability. Consider potential innovations that could further minimize energy loss, contributing to a greener future in transportation.
- 11. Now, let’s delve into the impact of air resistance on vehicle energy efficiency. As a car moves, it displaces air molecules, creating drag that reduces efficiency. The energy lost to air resistance can be calculated using the formula ∆Eair = 21cd(∆mair)v2, where cd is the drag coefficient, ∆mair is the mass of displaced air, and v is the velocity. For a typical car traveling at 60 mph, this results in a substantial energy loss. The loss increases with the square of the velocity, meaning higher speeds lead to significantly greater energy expenditure. For instance, a Toyota Camry traveling from Boston to New York at 60 mph loses about 133 MJ to air resistance, but this increases to 236 MJ at 80 mph. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for enhancing vehicle efficiency. Designing more aerodynamic vehicles with lower drag coefficients can mitigate these losses. Additionally, maintaining optimal speeds can drastically improve fuel efficiency. Reflect on how these principles can be applied to everyday driving to reduce energy consumption and environmental impact. Consider potential innovations in vehicle design and technology that could further minimize air resistance and contribute to sustainable transportation solutions.

- 12. Let’s delve deeper into the energy lost to air resistance during a road trip. For a Toyota Camry traveling from Boston to New York at 60 mph, approximately 133 MJ is lost to air resistance. This significant amount highlights the impact of aerodynamics on fuel efficiency. Increasing speed exacerbates this issue. At 80 mph, the energy loss rises to about 236 MJ, demonstrating that higher speeds demand more energy to overcome air resistance. This is because the energy loss is proportional to the square of the velocity. In addition to air resistance, rolling resistance also plays a role. This is the energy lost due to tire deformation and road friction. For a typical car, rolling resistance can account for around 54 MJ over the same distance. Understanding these factors is crucial for improving vehicle efficiency. Designing more aerodynamic vehicles and maintaining optimal speeds can significantly reduce energy loss. Keeping tires properly inflated is another simple yet effective way to minimize rolling resistance. Reflect on how these principles can be applied to everyday driving to enhance efficiency and reduce environmental impact. Consider potential innovations in vehicle design and technology that could further mitigate these energy losses, contributing to sustainable transportation solutions.
- 13. Now, let’s wrap up our energy analysis for the road trip from Boston to New York. We start with kinetic energy, about 2 MJ, accounting for stops along the way. Then, there’s the 27 MJ for potential energy, spent on climbing hills. Rolling resistance adds another 54 MJ, and air resistance claims a significant 133 MJ. Altogether, these factors total 216 MJ of energy used. However, the gasoline used provides 840 MJ, indicating an overall efficiency of roughly 25%. This means only a quarter of the fuel’s energy is utilized for motion, with the rest lost as heat and other inefficiencies. This analysis underscores the inefficiencies in automobile energy usage. By grasping these components, we can pinpoint areas for improvement. For instance, enhancing aerodynamics, reducing rolling resistance, and optimizing vehicle weight can boost efficiency. Reflect on how these insights can inform future innovations in vehicle design and technology. Consider how better understanding these dynamics can lead to more sustainable and efficient transportation solutions, reducing our environmental impact.
- 14. To enhance transport efficiency, we can apply fundamental physics principles. Reducing air resistance is key, as it significantly impacts energy consumption. By traveling at lower speeds—opting

- for 60 mph instead of 80 mph—we diminish drag and boost fuel efficiency. Streamlined vehicle designs also help cut through air more effortlessly. Public transportation offers another efficient alternative, as buses and trains inherently possess lower per capita drag. Maintaining vehicles with properly inflated tires is crucial, as it reduces rolling resistance and conserves energy. Innovative technologies, like regenerative braking, capture energy during braking, which can be reused, enhancing overall efficiency. This technology is particularly effective in stop-and-go traffic, maximizing energy savings. Looking ahead, concepts such as vacuum tunnels and magnetic levitation could revolutionize transportation by drastically reducing air and rolling resistance. While these ideas are futuristic, they demonstrate the potential for significant advancements in energy efficiency. Reflect on how these principles and innovations might be integrated into everyday travel. Consider their role in reducing environmental impact and fostering sustainable transportation solutions.
- 15. In conclusion, we’ve delved into the core concepts of mechanical energy, emphasizing kinetic and potential energy, and the effects of air resistance and friction. These elements are pivotal in understanding energy consumption in transportation.

We learned that kinetic energy, calculated as 12mv2, is essential for vehicle motion. Meanwhile, potential energy, expressed as mgh, becomes significant when navigating hills or elevated terrains.

Air resistance, quantified by 12cdAρv2, plays a crucial role in energy efficiency, especially at higher speeds. Minimizing this resistance can markedly enhance fuel economy.

Our energy analysis of a road trip revealed that out of the 840 MJ provided by gasoline, only 216 MJ is used for motion, highlighting the need for more efficient engines and innovative technologies. Looking ahead, we’ll explore the concept of heat and its impact on energy systems. I encourage you to review your lecture notes and reflect on how these principles can be applied to real-world challenges.

- **4. Transport Energy Example: Road Trip** Let’s examine a practical example of transport energy using a road trip from Boston to New York. This journey covers about 210 miles and requires a Camry with four passengers. To begin, we calculate the energy consumption. The car’s fuel efficiency is 30 miles per gallon, and gasoline contains roughly 120 megajoules per gallon. Thus, for this trip, the Camry will consume 7 gallons of gasoline, totaling approximately 840 megajoules of energy. But where does all this energy go? Part of it is used to overcome kinetic energy—the energy of motion—while the car travels at speeds of around 60 miles per hour. The remaining energy is used to counteract forces like friction and air resistance, which work to slow the car down. This example prompts us to ponder: Is the full 840 megajoules truly necessary? Are there ways to optimize energy use? By reflecting on these questions, we can explore strategies to enhance efficiency and sustainability in transportation.

- **5. Potential Energy** Now, let’s turn our attention to potential energy, a crucial component of mechanical energy. Potential energy is the energy stored in an object due to its position or configuration. A classic example is a ball placed atop a hill—its height confers potential energy, which can be converted into kinetic energy as it rolls down the hill. Grasping the conservation of energy is essential. This principle tells us that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed from one form to another. As the ball rolls, its potential energy diminishes, and kinetic energy increases. At the same time, the force of gravity acts upon the ball, driving its descent and converting energy from one form to another. Another instance is a stretched spring. The potential energy stored in the spring is due to its deformed state. When released, this energy is transferred into kinetic energy as the spring unravels. These examples illustrate how potential energy manifests and evolves. By exploring these principles, we gain insights into energy efficiency and sustainability. Understanding these dynamics is vital for developing systems that minimize energy waste and maximize output.

- As we proceed, think about applying these concepts to technological innovations. How can the principles of potential energy and conservation be harnessed to promote a more sustainable future? Reflect on these possibilities as we delve deeper into the interplay of energy forms.
- **6. Potential Energy, Forces, and Work** Let’s delve into the connection between potential energy, forces, and work. Consider a mass m under the influence of a force F = −kx, which is a spring force arising from a potential energy function U(x). The negative sign indicates that the force tends to reduce potential energy. Newton’s second law, F = ma = mx¨, describes the force as the mass times its acceleration. This equation reveals how forces influence the motion of objects, altering their kinetic energy. When a force acts over a distance, it performs work. The work W done by a force is given by W = F(x)dx. In the case of a spring, the work performed equals the change in potential energy, W = −∆U.

Conservation of energy is pivotal. It states that the total energy, the sum of kinetic energy Ek and potential energy U, remains constant in the absence of external dissipative forces. Mathematically,

Ek + U = constant. This principle is fundamental in many areas of physics and engineering, as it allows us to analyze complex systems by tracking energy flow and conservation. Reflect on how these principles can be applied to real-world scenarios, such as oscillating systems or mechanical devices. How can an understanding of forces and potential energy aid in designing more efficient systems? As we proceed, consider these applications and the broader implications for energy efficiency and sustainability.

- **7. Potential Energy and Vectors** Now, let’s delve into the role of vectors in potential energy and force expressions. When objects move along a line, we use a one-dimensional vector, F = mx¨, to depict the force. This vector form emphasizes the direction and magnitude of the force acting on an object. In two or three dimensions, we employ three-dimensional vectors to fully capture the force’s effect. A three-dimensional vector force is expressed as F = ma = mddt22x = (mx,m¨ y,m¨ z¨). The potential energy landscape varies in complexity with dimensions. For a system with a potential energy function U(x,y,z), the force can be expressed as a gradient vector: F = −∇U =

−∂U∂x ,−∂U∂y ,−∂U∂z .

A key example is gravitational force, given by F = −∇U = −GMmr2 rˆ. This equation illustrates how gravity acts to decrease potential energy, always pointing towards the center of mass.

Understanding vector representations of potential energy and forces allows us to analyze complex systems, such as planetary orbits and mechanical structures. How can the principles of vector calculus and potential energy aid in solving real-world engineering challenges? Reflect on these applications as we continue to explore the connections between these mathematical concepts and their significance in physics and beyond.

- **8. Potential Energy: Applications** Let’s examine some practical applications of potential energy. Consider an airplane at high altitude. The potential energy an airplane possesses is given by U = mgh, where m is the mass, g is the acceleration due to gravity, and h is the height. For a 747 traveling at 900 km/h, this potential energy can reach an impressive 11 gigajoules at an altitude of 40,000 feet. Potential energy is equally important on a smaller scale. Take, for example, water pumps that lift water uphill to storage tanks. This process converts electrical energy into potential energy, allowing the water to be stored until needed. Similarly, elevators and cranes utilize potential energy to lift loads against gravity, showcasing the versatility of potential energy in both engineering and everyday life. These examples highlight the significance of potential energy in both everyday applications and large-scale industrial processes. Understanding potential energy not only helps in appreciating the efficiency of various machines but also prompts us to think creatively about energy storage and utilization in new technologies. As we proceed, consider how these principles can be applied to sustainable energy solutions. How

- can the understanding of potential energy contribute to developing more efficient energy systems? Reflect on these possibilities as we continue to explore the dynamic interplay between energy forms and their applications in the world around us.
- **9. Back to the Road Trip** Let’s return to our road trip scenario, where we calculated an energy expenditure of 840 megajoules for a 4000 lb car traveling at 60 mph from Boston to New York. Both cities are at sea level, so does potential energy play a role here? Surprisingly, even at sea level, potential energy is significant due to the road’s elevation profile. As you travel, the road’s elevation changes can alter the car’s potential energy. Climbing a hill increases potential energy, while descending allows some energy recapture through kinetic energy. On our typical road trip, minor elevation changes occur, particularly on highways like I-95, which have noticeable elevation gains. These variations in elevation mean that potential energy is not just a theoretical concept but a practical consideration in energy accounting. Taking potential energy into account can influence how we approach fuel efficiency. Understanding these energy dynamics encourages us to think critically about optimizing vehicle efficiency and considering the natural landscape’s impact on energy use. As we continue, think about how these principles can be applied to other real-world situations. How can recognizing potential energy help us in everyday activities or in the design of efficient transportation systems? Reflect on these possibilities and their potential to enhance our understanding of energy in the world around us.
- **10. Estimate Effects of Hills** When planning a road trip from Boston to New York, examining the impact of hills on energy use is essential. Even with a constant speed of 60 mph, elevation changes significantly affect a vehicle’s energy consumption. Each mile gained in elevation requires approximately 50 feet of elevation gain. Assuming this scenario, 27 megajoules of energy are needed just to tackle the hills—this calculation is based on the energy cost of climbing a hill, mgh, where m is the mass, g is the acceleration due to gravity, and h is the height gained. This energy is partly recovered when descending, but not entirely, due to friction and other losses. Thus, some energy is recaptured on the way down, not all of it is regained. The implications for energy use are noteworthy. Even minor hills can result in a substantial portion of the total energy expenditure during a journey. This highlights the need to consider elevation changes when evaluating energy efficiency in driving. These calculations encourage critical thinking about route planning and energy efficiency. As we delve deeper into energy use in transportation, think about how overcoming hills affects overall fuel consumption and what strategies could reduce this impact. How might engineering solutions or driving habits be improved to address these challenges?
- **11. Air Resistance and Friction** During a road trip, dealing with air resistance is an inevitable challenge that hampers a car’s efficiency. As a vehicle moves, it interacts with air molecules, creating resistance that reduces fuel efficiency.

This air resistance, or drag, is calculated using the formula ∆Eair = 12cd(∆mair)v2, where cd is the drag coefficient, ∆mair is the mass of air displaced, and v is the velocity of the vehicle.

The drag coefficient varies with a vehicle’s design; for typical cars, cd is approximately 1/3. This formula reveals that energy lost to air resistance is directly linked to the vehicle’s speed and the density of the air. At higher speeds, the energy loss escalates significantly. Streamlining a car’s design can substantially decrease this energy loss. By reducing the drag coefficient and minimizing surface area, vehicles can cut down on air resistance and improve fuel efficiency. This principle is evident in the aerodynamic designs of modern vehicles. Understanding these dynamics not only highlights the importance of engineering in enhancing vehicle efficiency but also encourages us to think critically about optimizing energy use in transportation. As we proceed, consider how these principles can be applied to create more sustainable transportation

methods. How might these ideas influence the future of car design and other forms of travel? Reflect on these possibilities and their potential to transform our approach to energy efficiency in the coming years.

- **12. Total Energy Lost to Air Resistance** Now, let’s delve into the energy lost due to air resistance during a road trip from Boston to New York. Using the formula derived earlier, Wair = 21cd(AD)ρv2, we can estimate this energy loss. The drag coefficient (cd) for a typical car is about 0.33. For a journey of 330 kilometers at a speed of 27.7 meters per second, the total energy lost to air resistance is approximately 133 megajoules. But how does this stack up with other energy expenditures during the trip? Consider that rolling resistance and hills each consume around 54 and 27 megajoules, respectively. Compared to the 210 megajoules total energy available from the gasoline burned, a significant portion is attributed to air resistance. This analysis highlights the importance of reducing air resistance to enhance fuel efficiency. Streamlining a car’s design, increasing tire pressure, and maintaining a moderate speed can mitigate this energy loss. Exploring these strategies offers promising avenues to optimize vehicle efficiency. As we wrap up this lecture, think about how these insights might be applied to real-world transportation challenges. How can we harness these principles to foster more sustainable travel options? Reflect on these possibilities and their potential to transform our approach to energy efficiency in the years ahead.

- **13. Final Energy Accounting** Let’s recap the various energy expenditures during our hypothetical road trip from Boston to New York. We began by accounting for kinetic energy, estimating about 2 megajoules necessary for maintaining speed and managing stoplights. Adding to this, the energy required to conquer hills amounts to around 27 megajoules, considering an average elevation gain of 50 feet per mile. Rolling resistance also claims approximately 54 megajoules, emulating a 1% grade, while air resistance incurs a substantial 133 megajoules, assuming a constant speed of 60 mph. The total energy usage for this journey is roughly 216 megajoules. It’s crucial to recognize that these calculations are based on a 25% efficient internal combustion engine, with 840 megajoules of gasoline energy consumed during a 330 km trip. This energy accounting highlights the impact of various factors on fuel efficiency. It directs our attention to optimization possibilities, such as enhancing engine efficiency, reducing air resistance, and exploring alternative propulsion systems. As we analyze city driving conditions, which are heavily influenced by acceleration, rolling resistance, and stoplights, we must consider how these elements differ from long highway trips. City driving tends to consume more energy due to frequent stopping and starting. This examination of energy use in transportation prompts us to contemplate future innovations. How can we refine our approach to energy efficiency in vehicles? Reflect on these potential advancements and their possible transformation of our relationship with energy.
- **14. Reducing Transport Energy Costs** Now, let’s explore how to cut down on transport energy costs. A key piece of advice is to drive at

lower speeds, as air resistance (Wair) is proportional to the square of the speed. Thus, choosing a speed of 60 mph instead of 80 mph can significantly cut down on energy use.

Designing vehicles to be more streamlined is another effective strategy. By reducing the drag coefficient (cd) and the vehicle’s cross-sectional area (A), we can greatly lessen air resistance. Additionally, mass transit systems offer a sustainable solution by carrying more passengers, thereby reducing the energy required per person. Proper tire inflation is often overlooked but is crucial for reducing rolling resistance. Ensuring tires are adequately inflated can enhance fuel efficiency by decreasing the force needed to roll the tires. Modern engines, like those in Toyota hybrids, also play a vital role. They optimize the energy used during acceleration and deceleration, improving overall efficiency. Regenerative braking systems are

another feature that capture energy during braking, storing it for future use. Looking to the future, technologies such as vacuum tunnels and space-based railways offer theoretically near-zero energy solutions. Although not yet practical, these concepts hold promise for future transportation. Implementing these strategies can lead to substantial energy cost reductions and a more sustainable future. As you consider these ideas, think about their application in your daily life. How can you contribute to energy efficiency in transportation? Reflect on these possibilities and their potential to transform our approach to energy use in the years ahead.
