Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in understanding common visual elements such as landscapes, household objects, and public events, largely due to their large-scale datasets and advanced training strategies. However, their effectiveness in medical applications remains limited due to the inherent discrepancies between data and tasks in medical scenarios and those in the general domain. Concretely, existing medical MLLMs face the following critical limitations: (1) limited coverage of medical knowledge beyond imaging, (2) heightened susceptibility to hallucinations due to suboptimal data curation processes, and (3) lack of reasoning capabilities tailored for complex medical scenarios. To address these challenges, we first propose a comprehensive data curation procedure that (1) efficiently acquires rich medical knowledge data not only from medical imaging but also from extensive medical texts and general-domain data; and (2) synthesizes accurate medical captions, visual question answering (VQA), and reasoning samples. As a result, we build a multimodal dataset enriched with extensive medical knowledge. Building on the curated data, we introduce our medical-specialized MLLM: Lingshu. Lingshu undergoes multi-stage training to embed medical expertise and enhance its task-solving capabilities progressively. Besides, we preliminarily explore the potential of applying reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards paradigm to enhance Lingshu’s medical reasoning ability. Additionally, we develop MedEvalKit, a unified evaluation framework that consolidates leading multimodal and textual medical benchmarks for standardized, fair, and efficient model assessment. We evaluate the performance of Lingshu on three fundamental medical tasks, multimodal QA, text-based QA, and medical report generation. The results show that Lingshu consistently outperforms the existing open-source multimodal models on most tasks. Furthermore, we conduct five case studies closely aligned with real-world scenarios, demonstrating Lingshu’s potential for practical applications in medical contexts.

- 1 Introduction

Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly propelled progress in multimodal domains (OpenAI, 2024a; DeepMind, 2025a; Chen et al., 2025b; Kimi et al., 2025; Zhu et al., 2025), demonstrating capabilities that approach expert-level proficiency in areas like image captioning, visual question answering, and complex reasoning. Despite these successes, the performance of MLLMs in medical applications remains notably constrained (Yan et al., 2023; Lee et al., 2023; Nori et al., 2023). Biomedical image-text pairs differ fundamentally from typical web-based content, presenting unique challenges that general visual assistants are not well-equipped to handle (Li et al., 2025b). Lacking domain-specific medical visual knowledge, these models often respond to biomedical inquiries either with uncertainty or, worse, with incorrect information and hallucinations (Li et al., 2023a; Chen et al., 2024c).

To address these gaps, recent studies have concentrated on adapting models specifically for medical contexts by integrating general-purpose LLMs or MLLMs with medical multimodal data to construct specialized

Our results demonstrate that Lingshu achieves promising performance across various medical benchmarks and modalities. Furthermore, case studies in downstream tasks highlight its practical utility and significant potential in real-world healthcare settings.

models (Wu et al., 2023; Hyland et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2024a,b; Seyfioglu et al., 2025). These models demonstrate encouraging results in various tasks, including medical VQA, medical report generation, and diagnostic support, underscoring the considerable potential of MLLMs in healthcare scenarios. Pioneering models, such as LLaVA-Med (Li et al., 2023a), directly employ PubMed-derived datasets for vision-language alignment and supervised fine-tuning. However, their performance remains limited due to low data quality and inherent noise within PubMed. Subsequent research (Chen et al., 2024c; Li et al., 2025b; Lin et al., 2025) addresses the challenges with refined training recipes as well as larger and higher-quality medical multimodal datasets. Concurrently, advances in reasoning models, exemplified by OpenAI’s o-series (OpenAI, 2024b, 2025b) and DeepSeek-R1 (DeepSeek-AI, 2025), set new benchmarks through advanced post-training techniques. Inspired by reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR; Shao et al. (2024); Yu et al. (2025)), some studies (Lai et al., 2025; Pan et al., 2025) attempt to integrate this technique into the training of medical models to improve reasoning capabilities and enhance performance in clinical applications.

https://www.highcharts.com/demo/highcharts/parallel-coordinates-polar 1/1

Although significant progress has been achieved, existing medical MLLMs typically focus on collecting imagetext pairs by distilling knowledge from advanced models (OpenAI, 2024a,b, 2025a,b; DeepMind, 2025a,b). This solution is easy to implement and is scalable, but has notable limitations. First, medical tasks inherently demand extensive and diverse domain-specific knowledge. Nevertheless, the current distilled data are generated by prompting advanced models with medical imaging. These imaging prompts present challenges in extracting essential knowledge related to pharmacology, public health, and clinical contexts from the advanced models. Second, many distillation processes lack additional labels or supervision, relying exclusively on the generative capability of large models, thereby increasing hallucination risks. Third, the existing distilled data fall short in addressing complex medical cases that extend beyond basic image-text correlations and necessitate sequential decision-making.

In this work, we address the challenges of medical data curation via (1) efficiently acquiring rich medical knowledge data by collecting not only multimodal medical data but also extensive medical texts and generaldomain multimodal/text data; and (2) synthesizing accurate medical data through a robust pipeline for generating captions, QA pairs, and chain-of-thoughts (CoTs) reasoning samples. Leveraging this data, we develop Lingshu1, which is specifically tailored for the medical domain. Lingshu models undergo a multi-stage

1Lingshu originates from a chapter title in the Huangdi Neijing (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huangdi_Neijing), one of

training paradigm to progressively infuse medical knowledge and enhance their problem-solving abilities. Besides, we investigate the role of RLVR in improving Lingshu’s multimodal medical reasoning and develop Lingshu-RL. In addition to the data and model contributions, we find that current models are often evaluated in isolated, non-standardized environments. The lack of accessible, unified evaluation frameworks further restricts the development of the medical field. Therefore, we introduce MedEvalKit, a unified framework that consolidates major multimodal and textual medical benchmarks for efficient, standardized model assessment.

Extensive experiments demonstrate that Lingshu consistently achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across most multimodal and textual medical VQA tasks, as well as in report generation, for both 7B and 32B configurations. Notably, in medical VQA tasks, Lingshu-32B outperforms the second-best model by an average of 7.2 accuracy points across seven tasks, even surpassing proprietary models like GPT-4.1 and Claude Sonnet 4. Through comprehensive ablation studies, we further confirm the importance of data quality and medical knowledge coverage on overall performance, validating the effectiveness of our data curation framework. Finally, our case study underscores the great potential of Lingshu across numerous medical applications, including medical report generation, medical support assistance, and clinical surgery assistance.

To sum up, our contributions are fourfold:

- • Data: We introduce a novel data curation pipeline that efficiently gathers medical knowledge from various resources and synthesizes high-quality medical captions, QA pairs, and CoT reasoning samples.
- • Training: We propose our medical-specific MLLMs, Lingshu in 7B and 32B parameter sizes. Lingshu models are trained with our tailored, multi-stage training paradigm that progressively infuses extensive medical knowledge into MLLMs and enhances problem-solving abilities. We also explore the role of RLVR in improving the multimodal medical reasoning and develop Lingshu-RL.
- • Evaluation: We propose MedEvalKit, a unified evaluation framework that consolidates major benchmarks for multimodal and textual medical tasks, streamlining model assessment and advancing standardized performance evaluation in the medical field.
- • Performance: Through rigorous experimental validations, Lingshu demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across multiple multimodal and textual medical VQA tasks, as well as in report generation.

Paper organization. We first describe our data curation process in §2, followed by the introduction of detailed training methodology (§3). We then elaborate our unified medical evaluation framework, MedEvalKit in §4. The experimental results are reported in §5, followed by illustrative case studies in §6. Subsequently, we briefly review related literature on medical MLLMs in §7. Finally, we discuss limitations and outline directions for future research in §8.

- 2 Data Curation

We address the intricate challenges of medical data curation via two primary strategies: (1) comprehensive collection of diverse medical knowledge sources, including medical multimodal datasets, extensive medical texts, and general-domain multimodal/textual data; and (2) synthesis of high-quality medical data through a robust pipeline capable of generating detailed captions, OCR-based samples, QA pairs, and chain-of-thought reasoning examples. The overall medical data curation pipeline is illustrated in Figure 2.

For data collection, we curate a wide range of open-source datasets from the web, categorized as follows: (1) multimodal medical data for enhancing Lingshu’s comprehension of medical images and downstream task performance; (2) unimodal medical data, including standalone medical images and texts, to enrich domain knowledge and support synthetic data generation; (3) general-domain data to improve general visual and language understanding. All data undergo strict quality filtering prior to use. Each dataset is individually preprocessed and cleaned to ensure the quality and relevance.

For medical data synthesis, we generate targeted synthetic data to strengthen specific model capabilities: (1) long-form captions to improve diagnostic detail extraction from images; (2) OCR-based instruction data to enhance text recognition in medical imagery; (3) VQA samples for tasks such as diagnosis, anatomical

- 2.1.1 Medical Multimodal Data Collection

We incorporate two primary categories of existing multimodal medical data into our training set: (1) medical caption data, which pairs one or more medical images with descriptive text to facilitate semantic alignment between visual and textual modalities; and (2) medical multimodal instruction data, which includes image-instruction pairs. The latter comprises two main types: medical VQA data, featuring open-ended or multiple-choice questions about medical images, and medical report data, consisting of radiology reports that detail clinical findings and impressions. These datasets support MLLM in learning a broad range of medical multimodal tasks. A complete list of the collected datasets is provided in Table 1.

Medical text instruction data. Chen et al. (2023) has demonstrated that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on medical instruction data is effective in injecting medical knowledge into LLMs. Building on this insight, we incorporate medical text instruction data into our training corpus to enhance the domain knowledge of Lingshu. The incorporated data spans four primary categories: (1) medical factoid QA, including both free-form and multiple-choice questions on medical knowledge; (2) distilled reasoning data, which supplements answers with step-by-step reasoning path annotated by large reasoning models; (3) patient-doctor dialogues, comprising single-turn exchanges with patient queries and corresponding doctor responses; and (4) general

Medical imaging data. It comprises raw images paired with human-annotated metadata, including the depicted organ, diagnostic labels, and imaging modality. This metadata enables the synthesis of additional captioning and VQA samples to improve medical image understanding and downstream task performance. We primarily use these datasets for data synthesis, which is detailed in §2.2. Table 3 summarizes the collected datasets, which span a wide range of medical modalities.

- 2.1.3 General Domain Data Collection

To enhance the general visual understanding, text generation, and multimodal instruction-following capabilities of our medical MLLM, we incorporate diverse general-domain datasets. These include image captioning, textual, and multimodal instruction-following data, which collectively enhance the model’s generalization to a wide range of vision-language tasks. Specifically, we utilize LLaVA-1.5 captions (Liu et al., 2024) and PixMo (Deitke et al., 2024) for image captioning; LLaVA-1.5 (textual instruction subset) and OpenHermes-

- 2.1.4 Data Cleaning Process

Data cleaning for medical multimodal data. Many open-source multimodal medical datasets are extracted automatically from scientific papers and thus often contain noise and redundancy. To ensure data quality, we implement a three-stage cleaning pipeline. First, image filtering, where images with dimensions smaller than 64 pixels are removed to eliminate low-resolution or uninformative content. Second, image deduplication, where we apply perceptual hashing with a strict Hamming distance threshold of zero to detect and remove exact duplicate images, retaining only one high-quality instance per set. To accelerate this process, we use a chunk-based deduplication technique.2 Third, text filtering, where image caption samples with fewer than 10

The full pipeline is applied to all medical image captioning datasets. For instruction data, we omit the text filtering step due to the validity of concise responses, e.g., “yes/no”, word phrases, or short options. Image deduplication in instruction datasets specifically targets PubMedVision (Chen et al., 2024c) and LLaVAMed (Li et al., 2023a), which exhibit a high degree of redundancy. However, cross-dataset deduplication is avoided in this case, as individual images may be paired with diverse instructions. In contrast, image deduplication across all datasets is conducted for medical captioning data.

Data cleaning for medical text data. To ensure the quality and compliance of collected medical text instruction data, we implement two key cleaning procedures. First, we apply model-based response cleaning to opensource patient-doctor dialogue datasets, such as HealthCareMagic-100k (Li et al., 2023b) and iCliniq-10k (Li et al., 2023b), which are typically scraped from online healthcare platforms. These responses often contain sensitive identity information or provide explicit diagnoses and prescriptions, raising privacy and legal concerns. Specifically, we employ LLaMA-3.1-70B (Dubey et al., 2024) to remove identity-related content and revise responses to avoid direct medical recommendations, as detailed in Appendix A.1. Second, to eliminate redundancy, we perform text deduplication across multiple instruction datasets using min-hash locality-sensitive hashing (LSH), retaining only the highest-quality version of each near-duplicate based on the reliability of its source.

- 2.2 Medical Data Synthesis

This section details our methodologies for synthesizing four types of medical multimodal data—long-form captions, OCR-based instruction samples, VQA instances, and distilled reasoning examples—alongside the quality control strategy employed to ensure their accuracy and reliability.

- 2.2.1 Medical Long-form Caption Synthesis

Given the brevity and limited descriptive depth of existing medical caption datasets, we aim to construct enriched captions that capture key visual features in medical images. To this end, we utilize data from medical image segmentation and classification tasks, which include human-annotated disease regions, diagnostic labels, and metadata such as patient gender and X-ray view position. This structured factual knowledge enables the synthesis of detailed and authentic medical captions. To ensure modality diversity and improve the model’s visual perception across imaging types, we source data from multiple modalities and balance their volume in the constructed caption dataset.

Specifically, we collect AbdomenUS (Vitale et al., 2020) for Ultrasound; PAD-UFES-20 (Pacheco et al., 2020) for Dermoscopy; CheXpert (Irvin et al., 2019), NIH-Chest-X-Ray (Rajpurkar et al., 2017), and Mendeley Digital Knee X-ray (Gornale and Patravali, 2020) for X-ray; KIPA22 (He et al., 2021) and DeepLesion (Yan et al., 2017) for CT; BraTS2024 (de Verdier et al., 2024), Brain-Tumor-MRI (Nickparvar, 2021), LLD-MMRI (Lou et al., 2025), and MAMA-MIA (Garrucho et al., 2025) for MRI; and CPD (Wagner et al., 2023), Breast-Cancer (Ding et al., 2023), PanNuke (Gamper et al., 2020), and EBHI-Seg (Shi et al., 2023) for Histopathology. For each image, we adopt GPT-4o (OpenAI, 2024a), whose prompt is shown in Appendix A.4, to generate a detailed long-form caption that captures fine-grained visual features. The captioning process follows a five-stage pipeline: (1) metadata preparation, (2) region-of-interest (RoI) identification, (3) annotation with factual knowledge, (4) annotation with doctor preference, and (5) summarization. This procedure yields approximately 100K high-quality medical image captions.

- Stage 1: metadata preparation. This stage leverages metadata to provide essential contextual information for a given image, including modality, disease type, and, when applicable, camera view and observable patient characteristics. Following Xie et al. (2025), we begin by extracting metadata from each dataset, applying dataset-specific rules to convert this information into short captions. For example, in CPD (Wagner et al., 2023), we generate short captions using a staining method and nuclei score metadata with the template: “A WSI image of carcinogenic DNA damage caused by ultraviolet (UV) radiation. The image is stained for {staining}. The relative amount of damaged nuclei (bounded in [0,1]) is {nuclei score}.” To minimize hallucination risk, we exclude metadata not visually inferable from the image, e.g., patient age, based on expert consultation. All personal identifiers are removed to prevent racial or demographic biases. Additionally, we manually retrieve medical knowledge from the web to enhance the annotation process, particularly for models like GPT-4o that may lack domain-specific expertise. Thus, this stage involves metadata preparation from both the dataset and external medical references.
- Stage 2: RoI identification. Building upon the textual data obtained in Stage 1, this stage incorporates complementary visual information. For image segmentation datasets, it provides disease or abnormality localization through RoIs, which are critical for reducing hallucinations and must be clearly marked in the images. RoIs are available as either segmentation masks or bounding boxes. Bounding boxes are directly overlaid on the original images, while segmentation masks are converted into bounding boxes by computing the minimal enclosing rectangles. For 3D datasets such as MAMA-MIA (Garrucho et al., 2025) and KIPA22 (He et al., 2021), we extract 2D slices and their corresponding masks along the z-axis, and apply the same bounding box rendering procedure to generate 2D images.
- Stage 3: annotation with factual knowledge. This stage focuses on synthesizing image descriptions by integrating textual and visual information from the previous two stages. For datasets with annotated RoIs, we input bounding-box-rendered images, short captions, and retrieved medical knowledge into GPT-4o to generate descriptive text. For datasets lacking RoI annotations, such as image classification tasks, GPT-4o is prompted with the original image and metadata from Stage 1. Since visual and textual inputs from the last two stages are both manually annotated, the resulting descriptions are considered highly reliable.
- Stage 4: annotation with doctor preference. Although the generated factual descriptions are highly reliable, they are often constrained by explicitly available metadata and may overlook critical visual details beyond RoIs. To mitigate this, we consult medical professionals to identify key factors they consider when interpreting medical images. Their insights are distilled into task-specific instructions. For instance, in MRI analysis, clinicians focus on sequence type, image orientation, anatomical structures, and visible abnormalities. These instructions are used to guide the annotation model, which, given the original image without bounding box overlays, generates alternative descriptions aligned with expert diagnostic perspectives.
- Stage 5: summarization. We use GPT-4o to combine the outputs from stages 3 and 4 to consolidate the final caption for each medical image. To avoid conflict, the description from stage 3 is prioritized due to its higher reliability. Figure 3 presents a representative example of a synthesized long-form caption for an MRI image.

[Figure 25]

This MRI brain image reveals a meningioma located near the base of the skull in the lower right region, specifically in the infratentorial space near the cerebellum. The tumor is well-defined, round, and emits a bright signal, contrasting with the surrounding darker brain tissue on the T1weighted image. The meningioma is causing a mass effect, gently

displacing the adjacent brain structures without evidence of significant invasion. Anatomical structures visible include the frontal and parietal lobes, as well as the cerebellum and brainstem. The gyri and sulci of the

cerebral cortex appear normal, with no other abnormalities noted. This imaging highlights the utility of MRI in diagnosing and understanding the spatial relations of intracranial lesions like meningiomas, which can exert pressure on nearby brain tissues and structures.

- 2.2.2 Medical OCR-based Instruction Data Synthesis

OCR-based instruction datasets enhance the model’s ability to interpret textual information embedded within medical images, a common scenario involving elements such as patient identifiers, age, and biological metrics. To construct these datasets, we collect biology and chemistry exam questions with ground-truth answers from online sources, as these subjects are closely related to the medical domain and offer rich resources. Each question is annotated with detailed reasoning steps using Gemini-2.0-Flash-Thinking (DeepMind, 2025a), and only samples with answers that exactly match the ground-truth are retained. The validated questions are then rendered as images to form multimodal instruction data, where the question image serves as input and the textual answer as output (see Table 4). This process yields a total of 50K high-quality OCR-based samples.

- 2.2.3 Medical VQA Data Synthesis

Medical diagnosis, anatomy identification, and modality classification are core competencies required for MLLMs to perform diverse medical multimodal tasks. To strengthen Lingshu’s capabilities in these areas, we synthesize additional medical VQA data using two complementary strategies: a template-based method and a self-instruct-based method.

Template-based method. This method constructs VQA samples using human-annotated meta-information, e.g., abnormality labels, from public medical imaging datasets. Specifically, we extract datasets containing labels related to anatomical structures, abnormalities, or imaging modalities. For each label type, we manually design question templates. Ground-truth answers are derived from the original annotations, while distractor options are sampled from the label space of the respective dataset. This approach enables a structured generation of high-quality VQA data. An example of this process is illustrated in Figure 4.

Self-instruct-based method. To enhance question diversity and linguistic variation, we leverage GPT-4o to generate VQA samples from (image, caption) pairs sourced from medical captioning datasets. GPT-

- 2.2.4 Medical Reasoning Data Distillation

Most existing open-source and our synthesized medical instruction data, primarily composed of short-answer and multiple-choice questions, lack explicit annotations of the underlying reasoning process. To strengthen the model’s medical reasoning capabilities, we employ GPT-4o to generate CoT reasoning trajectories for a subset of both multimodal and textual instruction data. Specifically, for each sample, we provide GPT-4o with the question, ground-truth answer, and, if applicable, answer options and the corresponding medical image. GPT-4o is instructed to produce a step-by-step reasoning path without relying on or explicitly referencing the ground-truth answer. To ensure quality, we implement an LLM-based validation process wherein GPT-4o evaluates the consistency between the reasoning trace and the ground-truth answer. Samples deemed inconsistent are excluded from the final dataset. The prompts are detailed in Appendix A.3.

- 2.3 Dataset Summary

The data collection and synthesis pipelines yield 3.75M high-quality open-source medical samples and 1.30M high-quality synthetic medical samples, respectively. We also conduct rigorous quality checks on all samples to ensure the overall data quality. To prevent data contamination, we perform strict image and text deduplication by excluding any images and samples overlapping with the evaluation benchmarks in MedEvalKit. Moreover, we examine the distribution of medical image modalities within the training set. As many multimodal datasets lack explicit modality annotations, we train a modality classifier based on BiomedCLIP (Zhang et al., 2025b) to infer the modalities of unlabeled samples. Figure 5 presents the resulting modality distribution. Our dataset covers over 12 medical imaging modalities, substantially enhancing the model’s versatility and applicability on medical downstream tasks across a wide spectrum of modalities.

###### 3 Model Training

Lingshu is built upon the Qwen2.5-VL model architecture (Bai et al., 2025), which consists of three key components: a large language model (LLM), a vision encoder, and an MLP-based projector. We employ two parameter-scaled variants of Qwen2.5-VL, i.e., 7B-Instruct and 32B-Instruct, as the foundational models. The choice of instruct versions is motivated by two primary considerations. First, these models require significantly less alignment data during training, owing to their inherent image understanding and instruction-following capabilities. Second, they support the direct use of instruction-formatted data during the alignment phase. Consequently, Lingshu can adopt instruction-style data formatting from the initial training stage, which

promotes consistency across the multi-stage training pipeline, reduces the overhead of additional instruction alignment, simplifies the training process, and enhances overall training stability.

- 3.1 Training Recipe

Building on prior advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs; Bai et al. (2025); Zhu et al. (2025)), we develop a multi-stage training framework to progressively adapt the backbone model to the medical domain. This framework follows a “shallow-to-deep” progression and comprises four sequential stages: (1) Medical Shallow Alignment, (2) Medical Deep Alignment, (3) Medical Instruction Tuning, and (4) Medical-oriented Reinforcement Learning. The overall training pipeline is illustrated in Figure 6. Note that our Lingshu is trained after the first three stages. We further explore the effectiveness of RL in medical reasoning, leading to Lingshu-RL version.

The initial two stages focus on constructing a robust vision-language foundation tailored to medical scenarios. Medical Shallow Alignment fine-tunes the model using a small set of medical image-text pairs, enabling it to encode medical images and generate corresponding descriptions accurately. This stage facilitates the model’s preliminary understanding of visual medical content. Medical Deep Alignment builds upon this by introducing larger, higher-quality, and semantically richer medical image-text pair datasets. This stage deepens the model’s domain knowledge and achieves finer-grained vision-language alignment.

The subsequent stages aim to enhance the model’s utility in practical medical settings. Medical Instruction Tuning improves the model’s ability to comprehend and execute task-specific instructions across various medical use cases, thereby enhancing its generalizability to downstream tasks. Finally, Medical-oriented Reinforcement Learning incorporates the Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR; Shao et al. (2024); Lai et al. (2025); Pan et al. (2025)) paradigm to strengthen the model’s medical reasoning, problem-solving capacity, and interpretability.

###### Figure 6 The training pipeline of Lingshu, which consists of four stages: medical shallow alignment, medical deep alignment, medical instruction tuning, and medical-oriented reinforcement learning. Note that our Lingshu is trained after the first three SFT stages. We additionally apply RL on top of it, leading to Lingshu-RL version.

- 3.1.1 Medical Shallow Alignment

The goal of the medical shallow alignment stage is to establish effective alignment between diverse medical imaging modalities and their corresponding textual descriptions. This alignment enhances the model’s ability to comprehend and interpret medical images, thereby laying a solid foundation for subsequent medical knowledge integration. During this phase, the LLM is kept frozen, while only the vision encoder and the projector are fine-tuned using coarsely annotated medical image-caption data.

Freezing the LLM is a deliberate choice, as the coarse caption data typically consists of short and informationsparse text. Exposing the LLM to such limited textual content could potentially impair its language generation capabilities. In contrast, training the vision encoder and projector enables the model to better map medical visual features into the LLM’s representational space. The use of coarsely annotated data is motivated by its relatively low semantic complexity, which facilitates rapid learning of the general characteristics of medical imaging modalities. This not only aids in effectively adjusting the vision encoder’s outputs for better alignment with the LLM but also contributes to faster training and improved convergence stability. As shown in Table 5, the coarsely annotated medical image-caption data comprises two datasets with relatively short and concise captions, i.e., PMC-OA (Lin et al., 2023) and ROCO (Pelka et al., 2018).

- 3.1.2 Medical Deep Alignment

The goal of the medical deep alignment stage is to comprehensively integrate medical knowledge into MLLM, enhancing its capabilities to understand diverse medical concepts and adapt to various clinical contexts. To achieve this, all model parameters, including those of the LLM, vision encoder, and projector, are unfrozen to allow end-to-end fine-tuning. This process is designed to improve the model’s ability in multimodal knowledge integration and its effectiveness in interpreting complex medical visual data.

During this stage, training is conducted on a substantially more diverse and enriched set of medical image-text pairs. Compared to the preceding shallow alignment phase, the dataset is significantly expanded in terms of modality diversity, linguistic complexity, and structural completeness. It includes images from less common medical imaging modalities, longer and more structured captions, as well as synthetic image-caption pairs generated from medical image classification and segmentation tasks.

Moreover, high-quality general-domain multimodal image-text data is incorporated into the training process alongside medical data. This joint training not only helps preserve the model’s general multimodal capabilities but also introduces it to a wider variety of visual formats, such as charts, tables, graphs, mathematics, and

scientific illustrations. Exposure to these structured visual elements enhances the model’s ability to perform structured data interpretation and cross-modal reasoning.

This is particularly beneficial in medical contexts where diagnostic reports often include laboratory tables, time-series physiological curves, and pathological maps—visual formats that differ significantly from natural images in both distribution and semantics. By learning from these general-domain examples, the model acquires transferable skills in chart interpretation and symbolic reasoning, enabling more precise analysis of abnormal physiological metrics, lesion measurements, and their temporal dynamics in clinical scenarios. The overall medical and general image caption dataset usage is summarized in Table 5.

- 3.1.3 Medical Instruction Tuning

In line with the prevailing practices in MLLMs (Li et al., 2023a; Chen et al., 2024c; Zhu et al., 2025; Chen et al., 2025c), the medical instruction-tuning stage is designed to refine MLLM’s instruction following capability with a broad spectrum of task directives, ensuring that its outputs are accurately aligned with user intentions. To accommodate a wide breadth of clinical use cases, we unlock all parameters and perform large-scale, end-to-end optimization of the entire model.

The training corpus transcends conventional instruction formats, such as image descriptions, question-answer pairs, and multiple-choice questions, by integrating an extensive suite of scenario-oriented queries collected and synthesized from multiple sources. These queries span diagnosis, clinical examination, medical knowledge retrieval, clinical report generation, and anatomical structure localization. This breadth markedly augments the model’s domain competency. In addition, we enrich the corpus with carefully vetted high-quality generaldomain data and medical text data, both of which have proven effective in enhancing performance on downstream medical tasks. Incorporating such data is capable of counterbalancing the inherent image-centric information bias of image-text pair data, expanding the model’s conceptual scope beyond visual content, and fostering a more holistic grasp of medical knowledge.

Moreover, our training data comprises advanced and complex data formats, such as multi-image reasoning tasks, multi-turn dialogues, and queries that require detailed reasoning processes, which demand deeper analytical acuity. Collectively, this diversified and sophisticated training data equips the MLLM to navigate complex clinical scenarios with enhanced precision and analytical capabilities.

The datasets used in this stage are summarized in Table 5, which are categorized based on their domain (i.e., medical or general) and modality (i.e., multimodal or textual):

- • In the medical multimodal subset, we initially employ multiple public medical instruction datasets, but found that they often emphasize specific image regions, which may introduce local view bias during training. Thus, we supplement the training with high-quality caption datasets—selected from ROCOv2 (Rückert et al., 2024), PubMedVision (Chen et al., 2024c), and MIMIC-CXR (Johnson et al., 2019)—to promote holistic visual understanding. We further incorporate clinical report generation datasets, CheXpert Plus (Chambon et al., 2024) and IU-Xray (Demner-Fushman et al., 2016). Lastly, we synthesize additional medical data, as detailed in §2.2, including OCR-based, QA, and CoT data.
- • For the general multimodal subset, we select the publicly available instruction-tuned version of LLaVA1.5 (Liu et al., 2024) and ALLaVA (Chen et al., 2024a).
- • In the medical text subset, we curate data from diverse public sources and generate instruction data via an automated synthesis pipeline, followed by strict quality validation. We further incorporate open-source long-form medical reasoning datasets, primarily distilled from OpenAI-o1 (OpenAI, 2024b) and DeepSeek-R1 (DeepSeek-AI, 2025), which offer comprehensive analyses of medical problems and effectively enhance the model’s medical knowledge.
- • For the general text subset, we leverage two public datasets, i.e., the text-only part of LLaVA-1.5 (Liu et al., 2024), and OpenHermes-2.5 (Teknium, 2023).

- 3.1.4 Medical-oriented Reinforcement Learning

Recent advancements in reasoning models, exemplified by OpenAI’s o-series (OpenAI, 2024b, 2025b) and DeepSeek-R1 (DeepSeek-AI, 2025), have set new benchmarks in complex tasks through advanced post-training strategies. Central to these improvements is reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO; Shao et al. (2024)) emerging as a prominent method due to its efficiency and effectiveness. It has been increasingly adopted for training MLLMs to enhance reasoning capabilities (Meng et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2025a; Tan et al., 2025). Building on RLVR’s success, some work applies it to medical domains for improving generalizability, interpretability, and reliability (Lai et al., 2025; Pan et al., 2025). Conventional SFT encounters key limitations: 1) over-reliance on answer supervision, which can cause overfitting and shortcut learning, particularly detrimental in medical scenarios; and 2) limited promotion of deliberate reasoning skills. RLVR addresses these issues by encouraging models to autonomously discover reasoning pathways through reward signals, rather than relying on answer memorization or teacherguided CoT imitation (Chu et al., 2025). Accordingly, we adopt GRPO to train Lingshu, leveraging a carefully curated medical verifiable dataset.

The medical verifiable dataset is derived from multiple medical sources (Table 5) and undergoes rigorous post-processing. Since most collected samples are in multiple-choice format, we reformulate those with word or phrase answers as open-ended questions to enhance difficulty while maintaining verifiability. This process also leads to a data balance between MCQA and open-ended QA. Additionally, binary-answer questions (e.g., “Yes”/“No”) are downsampled to approximately 5% of the dataset to mitigate potential bias from their over-representation. Samples are then selected based on their modality and query format, aiming to ensure the data balance. A total of 100K examples are curated to form the training set for the RL stage. For reward design, we follow common practices (DeepSeek-AI, 2025; Yeo et al., 2025) by using a strict format reward and an accuracy reward, with respective weights of 0.5 and 1.

3.2 Implementation Details

As previously outlined, Lingshu builds upon two variants of the Qwen2.5-VL-Instruct model, with parameter sizes of 7B and 32B, and is further optimized via continual training. The standard training process is organized into three primary stages, i.e., Medical Shallow Alignment, Medical Deep Alignment, and Medical Instruction Tuning. This leads to our Lingshu models. Across all stages, we adopt the AdamW optimizer with the cosine learning rate scheduler and a warm-up step of 100. The maximum sequence length is set to 8,192 tokens, the per-device training batch size is configured as 1, and the gradient accumulation step is set to 8.

In the Medical Shallow Alignment stage, LLM remains frozen, only the vision encoder and the projection layer are fine-tuned for one epoch, with learning rates set to 2e-6 and 1e-5, respectively. During the Medical Deep Alignment and Medical Instruction Tuning stages, we unfreeze the LLM and fine-tune it with a learning rate of 1e-5, while maintaining the same learning rates for the vision encoder and projector. These stages are trained for one and two epochs, respectively.

To enhance training efficiency, we employ data packing during the Medical Instruction Tuning stage. Preliminary experiments suggest that data packing at this stage does not adversely affect model performance. However, similar attempts in the Medical Shallow and Deep Alignment stages have led to a marked decline in model performance. This decline is likely attributable to the high prevalence of short textual samples within the medical image-caption dataset.3 When packed into longer sequences, these short entries contribute sparse gradients during normalization, undermining the training dynamics. Additionally, data packing substantially reduces the number of training steps, which may hinder sufficient convergence. Extending the number of epochs to compensate could result in overfitting. Consequently, we opt not to use data packing during the Medical Shallow and Deep Alignment stages.

For the Medical-oriented RL stage, we initialize training from Lingshu checkpoint and apply GRPO for one epoch using the AdamW optimizer. The maximum sequence length is set to 4096,4 with a rollout batch size of 512 and a global batch size of 128. The learning rate is configured at 1e-6, the sampling temperature at 1.0, the KL divergence loss coefficient at 1e-3, and 16 responses are sampled for each prompt. The resultant model is named as Lingshu-RL.

- 4 MedEvalKit: A Unified Medical Evaluation Framework

The rapid progress of medical MLLMs has yielded impressive performance across various tasks. However, the absence of a unified evaluation framework has led to inconsistencies in performance comparison across models. Additionally, reproducing or deploying existing models in a standardized environment often requires substantial time and computational resources. A systematic and rigorous evaluation across diverse medical tasks is essential for accurately assessing model capabilities, identifying strengths and limitations, and providing actionable feedback for further development. Reproducible, quantitative evaluation is thus vital to advancing the optimization of medical MLLMs.

An effective evaluation of medical MLLMs requires a multiple-dimensional assessment, including medical knowledge, visual understanding, and reasoning ability. While existing frameworks, such as LMMs-Eval (Zhang et al., 2025a), Eval-Harness (Gao et al., 2024), and VLMEvalKit (Duan et al., 2024), can be applied to evaluate medical MLLMs, they are primarily designed for general multimodal tasks. As a result, they exhibit limitations in terms of medical data coverage and model adaptation, making them difficult to apply directly. This not only reduces evaluation efficiency but may also introduce potential biases.

To comprehensively and efficiently evaluate the performance of medical MLLMs, we develop a systematic evaluation framework, termed MedEvalKit, which integrates mainstream medical benchmarks and task

samples generate significantly shorter outputs. Thus, we reduce the maximum sequence length to 4096 for this stage.

It covers representative tasks in medical multimodal and textual understanding, offering broad applicability. MedEvalKit accommodates both multimodal and text-only inputs, enabling unified evaluation of both medical MLLMs and medical LLMs. To enhance standardization and reproducibility, we standardized data preprocessing formats and post-processing protocols. A consistent model deployment and inference interface is provided, supporting rapid integration and one-click evaluation. For result assessment, MedEvalKit incorporates a dual verification mechanism that combines rule-based evaluation with an LLM-as-a-Judge strategy, integrating both objective and subjective assessment to improve evaluation stability and reliability. Additionally, the framework supports inference acceleration via vLLM (Kwon et al., 2023), enabling high-throughput and parallel evaluation, with strong scalability and engineering usability.

- 4.1 A Large-scale Medical Evaluation Benchmark

To enable a more comprehensive evaluation of medical MLLMs, we curated a collection of mainstream medical benchmark datasets covering multimodal question answering, text-only question answering, and report generation, comprising a total of 152,066 evaluation samples with 121,622 distinct medical images spanning 16 benchmark datasets. The overview of the medical evaluation benchmark is depicted in Figure 7. More detailed information is presented in Table 25.

Multimodal QA: We include the test sets of VQA-RAD (Lau et al., 2018), SLAKE (Liu et al., 2021), PathVQA (He et al., 2020), PMC-VQA (v2; Zhang et al. (2024b)), OmniMedVQA (Hu et al., 2024), MMMU (Yue et al., 2024), and MedXpertQA (Zuo et al., 2025). Specifically, we select the Health & Medical subset of MMMU, the multimodal portion of MedXpertQA, and the open-access part of OmniMedVQA. By incorporating these datasets, we encompass a diverse range of medical imaging modalities, including X-ray, CT scans, MRI, PET, ultrasound, microscopy, pathology, OCT, dermoscopy, gastrointestinal (GI) examinations, endoscopy, fundus, and medical-related charts, tables, and figures.

Text-only QA: We collect multiple medical text evaluation benchmarks, which comprise the test sets of MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2021), PubMedQA (Jin et al., 2019), MedMCQA (Pal et al., 2022), MedQAUSMLE (Jin et al., 2021), MedBullets (Chen et al., 2025a), MedXpertQA (Zuo et al., 2025), and SuperGPQA (Team et al., 2025). Specifically, we select the text portion of MedXpertQA, the medicine-related questions of MMLU by following the split in Wang et al. (2024b), and the test set of SuperGPQA by the official split criteria.

Report Generation: We utilize the official test splits of three established benchmarks: MIMIC-CXR (Johnson et al., 2019), IU-Xray (Demner-Fushman et al., 2016), and CheXpert Plus (Chambon et al., 2024). These datasets primarily consist of chest X-rays paired with corresponding radiology reports. We follow Zhang et al. (2024c) to filter out samples where both findings and impressions are empty.

Moreover, we standardize the input format for all questions based on the question types, while adhering to the officially recommended chat template of the candidate medical MLLMs to be evaluated. The input prompt format of each question type is illustrated in Figure 8.

- 4.2 Evaluation Metrics

As the evaluation set comprises multiple task types, each requiring its own evaluation criteria, we implement a range of task-specific evaluation protocols accordingly.

For the QA task, Accuracy is used as the primary evaluation metric. For multiple-choice questions, a two-stage evaluation strategy is adopted: rule-based matching is first applied to assess alignment with answer options; if insufficient, we further employ the official MMMU codebase5 to compute similarity scores and select the option with the highest score as the final answer. For open-ended questions, we directly leverage GPT-4.1 (2025-04-14 version; OpenAI (2025a)) to assess consistency between model outputs and reference answers, with the prompting strategy detailed in Appendix B.

For the report generation task, we develop a multi-metric evaluation approach that integrates semantic and model-based metrics, specifically tailored to address the challenges posed by the lengthy and highly open-ended nature of the outputs. This design enables a more comprehensive and granular assessment of model performance. For the semantic evaluation metrics, we choose Rouge-L (Lin, 2004) and CIDEr (Vedantam et al., 2015) to measure the quality of model-generated reports with respect to the reference answers. For the model-based evaluation metrics, we follow ReXrank (Zhang et al., 2024c) to utilize SembScore (Smit et al., 2020) and RaTEScore (Zhao et al., 2024b) to measure the candidate reports. We also include a composite metric RadCliQ-v1 (Yu et al., 2023). The detailed descriptions of these metrics are presented in Appendix B.

###### 5 Experiments

- 5.1 Experimental Settings

To comprehensively evaluate the performance of our model, Lingshu, on various medical benchmarks, we compare it against a diverse set of baseline models, encompassing both proprietary models and open-source MLLMs from both general and medical domains. The open-source MLLMs are further categorized based on the parameter size. Specifically, our evaluation includes the following models:

- • ProprietaryModels: GPT-4.1 (2025-04-14 version; OpenAI (2025a)), Claude Sonnet 4 (Anthropic, 2025), and Gemini-2.5-Flash (Preview 05-20 version; DeepMind (2025a)), which are the most representative proprietary models available.
- • Medical MLLMs: BiomedGPT (Zhang et al., 2024a), Med-R1 (Lai et al., 2025), MedVLM-R1 (Pan et al., 2025), MedGemma (Google, 2025), LLaVA-Med (Li et al., 2023a), HuatuoGPT-V (Chen et al., 2024c), BioMediX2 (Mullappilly et al., 2024), HealthGPT (Lin et al., 2025), and MedDr (He et al., 2024).
- • General-purpose MLLMs: Qwen2.5-VL-Instruct (Bai et al., 2025), InternVL2.5 (Chen et al., 2025c), and InternVL3 (Zhu et al., 2025).6

To ensure a fair and consistent comparison, all models are evaluated using our MedEvalKit (detailed in §4) within a standardized evaluation environment.

- 5.2 Performance Comparison on Medical Multimodal Benchmarks

- Table 6 presents a detailed comparison between Lingshu and a diverse set of both proprietary and open-source MLLMs across seven medical multimodal benchmarks. Proprietary models such as GPT-4.1, Claude Sonnet 4, and Gemini-2.5-Flash, demonstrate consistently strong performance, with Gemini-2.5-Flash attaining the highest average score (65.1) among them. Among open-source models with fewer than 10B parameters, Lingshu-7B achieves the highest average score (61.8), exceeding the best-performing baseline in this category by a substantial margin (+4.5). It ranks first on five out of seven benchmarks—SLAKE (83.1), PathVQA (61.9), PMC-VQA (56.3), OmniMedVQA (82.9), and MedXpertQA (26.7)—and secures second place on the remaining two, i.e., MMMU-Med and VQA-RAD. Notably, on PathVQA, Lingshu-7B outperforms the next best open-source model, MedGemma-4B-IT, by a wide margin (61.9 versus 48.8). Furthermore, Lingshu-7B

achieves an average performance comparable to GPT-4.1 and Claude Sonnet 4, highlighting its competitiveness despite significantly smaller parameters. With increased model capacity, Lingshu-32B attains a state-of-the-art average score of 66.6 across all benchmarks, outperforming both proprietary and open-source counterparts. These results validate the effectiveness of our approach and demonstrate its strong potential for broad application across diverse medical multimodal tasks.

5.3 Performance Comparison on Medical Textual Benchmarks

Although primarily designed as multimodal models, Lingshu exhibit remarkable proficiency in handling medical text-based tasks, underscoring its generalization capabilities across data modalities. As reported in

- Table 7, Lingshu-7B achieves the highest average accuracy among all open-source models with fewer than 10B parameters. It leads on four key benchmarks—PubMedQA (76.6), MedQA-USMLE (63.3), Medbullets (56.2), and MedXpertQA (16.5)—and ranks a close second on the remaining three benchmarks.

For larger-scale models, Lingshu-32B delivers even more pronounced improvements. It outperforms the second-best open-source competitor, InternVL3-38B, by an average of 3.4 percentage points in accuracy and secures top performance on six of the seven evaluated benchmarks, which highlights the scalability of Lingshu. Nevertheless, a performance gap persists between Lingshu and leading proprietary systems such as GPT-4.1, Claude Sonnet 4, and Gemini-2.5-Flash, particularly in tasks requiring deep clinical reasoning or access to extensive medical knowledge. Closing this gap is a primary objective of our ongoing research, which aims to

- 5.4 Performance Comparison on Report Generation Benchmarks

In addition to the conventional QA benchmarks, we further evaluate the model’s performance on a practical task of high clinical relevance: automatic medical report generation. The results, summarized in Table 8, cover three widely adopted benchmarks: MIMIC-CXR, CheXpert Plus, and IU-Xray. A case study about report generation can be found in §6.5. For models with fewer than 10B parameters, Lingshu-7B consistently surpasses all competing models on all three datasets, attaining either the best or second-best score for every evaluation metric. In the larger model size (>10B), performance differences among open-source models become more pronounced. Lingshu-32B delivers the strongest overall results, leading in almost all metrics. Notably, its IU-Xray score is nearly double that of the compared baselines. These quantitative gains are accompanied by two noteworthy qualitative observations: (1) On MIMIC-CXR and CheXpert Plus, larger models occasionally achieve lower performance compared to their smaller counterparts. We posit that this counterintuitive result may be because larger models produce more elaborate and stylistically varied descriptions, nuances that current automatic metrics fail to reward adequately. This finding highlights an urgent need for more sophisticated evaluation protocols for free-text medical report generation tasks. (2) Although the InternVL series achieves commendable scores on multimodal and textual QA benchmarks (see Tables 6 and 7), it underperforms markedly in report generation. This disparity reveals a substantial disconnect between benchmark-centric evaluations and the demands of real-world medical applications, underscoring the importance of task-specific assessment when deploying medical AI systems.

Models colored in light gray , gray and green denote the medical MLLMs, general-purpose MLLMs and our Lingshu, respectively. Metrics included are two semantic-based: ROUGE-L and CIDEr, two model-based: RaTE and SembScore (Semb), and one composite metric: RadCliQ-v1 (RadCliQ). As RadCliQ-v1 indicates better performance when the score is lower, we follow Zhang et al. (2024c) to take its reciprocal, i.e., RadCliQ−1. All scores are scaled by a factor of 100 to enhance clarity and comprehension.

- 5.5 Performance of Medical-oriented RL

We further conduct the initial exploration of RLVR to boost the medical multimodal reasoning capabilities of Lingshu. As reported in Table 9, while the RL-trained variant (Lingshu-RL-7B) achieves marginal improvements on MMMU-Med (+0.7%), PMC-VQA (+0.7%), and VQA-RAD (+0.4%), it shows performance degradation on SLAKE (−0.6%), PathVQA (−0.8%), and OMVQA (−1.6%). The average performance across all datasets remains relatively stable, indicating that the current RLVR training has not achieved the same improvements as those observed in the math/code domains. We identify two potential causes: (1) Reward Design: Our implementation adopted the prevailing approach of accuracy-oriented, rule-based rewards. However, medical reasoning is knowledge-driven, and acceptable answers, especially for open-ended questions, often exhibit substantial linguistic variability. Simple heuristics reward, therefore, may provide an unreliable signal of correctness, which can misdirect optimization. (2) Data Quality: A significant portion of medical multimodal problems do not necessitate complex reasoning processes, such as straightforward classification problems like identifying organ types. These data fail to effectively contribute to enhancing the model’s reasoning capabilities while introducing unnecessary noise to the training process. In this case, our current approach lacks criteria for selecting such reasoning-focused medical problems.

Overall, all four categories of training data outlined in §3.1.3, namely, {Medical, General} × {Multimodal,

Text}, collectively contribute to Lingshu’s medical multimodal task-solving ability, even when some data sources are not explicitly tailored for medical domain. Notably, medical textual data emerges as the most critical component; the removal of merely 173K samples leads to substantial performance degradation across five of the seven evaluated tasks.

Each data type contributes differently depending on the task. For instance, the exclusion of medical multimodal data (- Medical Multimodal) results in pronounced performance declines on benchmarks such as SLAKE, PathVQA, and OmniMedVQA. This likely reflects the heavy reliance of these datasets on histopathology and X-ray imagery, which are well represented in the medical multimodal training corpus. In contrast, removing general multimodal data (- General Multimodal) has a more adverse effect on tasks like MMMU-Med and PMC-VQA. These tasks appear to require a nuanced understanding of medical content presented in complex formats such as public health charts—knowledge that is underrepresented in current medical multimodal datasets.

We hypothesize that such specialized knowledge can be effectively supplemented through the inclusion of general-domain multimodal and textual data, thereby compensating for existing limitations in domain-specific resources. These observations reinforce our hypothesis: acquiring comprehensive medical knowledge for multimodal problem solving should not rely exclusively on medical multimodal data. Rather, it necessitates the integration of medical text and general-domain data to develop a more robust and generalizable model.

Beyond the overall data composition, we examine the contributions of several high-value data components:

- • Medical Caption (Stage 3): As mentioned in §3.1.3, we retain a subset of high-quality medical caption data during Stage 3 to mitigate local view bias. Experimental results indicate substantial performance degradation on benchmarks such as MMMU-Med, VQA-RAD, PMC-VQA, and OmniMedVQA upon its removal. This underscores the continued importance of incorporating high-quality caption data in the final stages of instruction tuning.
- • Medical Caption (Stage 1&2): To assess the role of early-stage training, we bypass Stages 1 and 2 and directly fine-tune the model using Stage 3 instruction data. This variant leads to moderate performance drops on PathVQA, PMC-VQA, and OmniMedVQA, suggesting that early-stage alignment remains a critical step in the training pipeline.
- • Synthetic Multimodal Medical data: Excluding all synthetic multimodal data, as defined in §2.2, yields notable declines in performance across MMMU-Med, SLAKE, PathVQA, and especially OmniMedVQA,

- which includes a broad spectrum of medical imaging modalities. These findings highlight the essential role of synthetic data in enriching modality diversity and compensating for gaps in existing datasets through the infusion of additional medical knowledge.
- • Distilled Textual Medical Reasoning Data: Building on prior evidence of the significance of textual data, we further isolate the impact of distilled medical reasoning texts. Results reveal that removing only this subset produces performance drops on five out of seven tasks, nearly equivalent to removing all medical textual data. We attribute this effect to the dense medical knowledge encoded within chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning traces. This finding suggests a promising direction for future research: developing diverse, high-quality corpora of medical reasoning texts to systematically enhance medical expertise acquisition.

Figure 9 Performance of different models across different medical modalities on OmniMedVQA.

The analysis in §5.2 demonstrates the effectiveness of Lingshu in diverse medical tasks. Here, we investigate how these MLLMs perform in terms of different medical modalities. Figure 9 benchmarks Lingshu-7B against the four strongest baselines based on their average performance in medical multimodal tasks, i.e., InternVL-3-8B, InternVL-2.5-8B, HuatuoGPT-V-7B, and MedGemma-4B-IT, on OmniMedVQA.

Across the eight medical imaging modalities evaluated, Lingshu either matches or exceeds the competitors on most fronts. It achieves leading performance in microscopy, MRI, dermoscopy, and OCT modalities that demand precise recognition of micro-textural and meso-structural cues; this suggests that Lingshu is particularly effective at capturing both high-frequency detail and anatomical regularities. Lingshu also delivers promising performance on ultrasound and fundus photography, underscoring its robustness in domains characterized by speckle noise (ultrasound) and fine vascular patterns (fundus). In CT and X-ray, Lingshu trails the best baseline by a modest margin. Overall, Lingshu establishes itself as a modality-agnostic yet high-resolution specialist, outperforming larger competitors despite its comparatively compact parameter budget. The gaps identified in modalities like CT and X-ray offer targeted opportunities for improving Lingshu in the future.

- 5.8 Analysis of Data Volume Scaling

- Figure 10 traces accuracy as the number of training samples is progressively expanded from 0% to 100% of its full size. A common pattern emerges across all seven benchmarks: accuracy rises sharply with the first quarter of additional data, then continues to climb—albeit with diminishing marginal gains—until it converges near the 75–100% mark. The smoothed curves reveal a near-monotonic trajectory that is partially obscured by the volatility of the raw scores, confirming that the overall trend is robust.

Two further observations merit emphasis. First, tasks that are intrinsically image-centric and less textintensive (e.g., SLAKE and PathVQA) saturate earlier than concept-heavy challenges such as MedXpertQA, which still registers steady improvements at the upper end of the data scale. Second, the aggregate plot mirrors the individual tasks, climbing from roughly 52% to 62% accuracy, thereby quantifying a clear data scaling for training medical MLLMs. Taken together, these findings highlight the decisive role of large-scale data acquisition while also signaling an eventual plateau, after which further progress will likely depend on qualitative data enrichment or architectural innovation rather than sheer volume alone.

6 Case Studies

This section presents illustrative case studies that showcase Lingshu in various clinical applications, such as medical diagnosis and report generation. All examples are produced with the Lingshu-32B model and, when feasible, compared with equivalently sized baseline models. The resulting comparisons elucidate the tangible advantages Lingshu can offer to both healthcare professionals and patients.

- 6.1 Visual Question Answering across Different Medical Imaging Modalities

Figure 11 presents the medical VQA cases of Lingshu across eight distinct medical modalities. The results highlight Lingshu is capable of transparent its reasoning process to derive a reliable decision.

Reasoning trajectory. Lingshu traces a diagnostic path that mirrors standard clinical workflows. In the chest-radiograph example, for instance, it inspects anatomical regions in the canonical order: first the “lungs,” then the “heart,” followed by the “bony structures,” and finally the “diaphragm” and “costophrenic angles.” This systematic progression ensures comprehensive coverage of relevant findings.

Decision refinement. Rather than issuing a final diagnosis immediately, the model incrementally constrains the differential. In the dermoscopy case, the initial hypothesis set included “seborrheic keratosis,” “basalcell carcinoma,” and “dermatofibroma.” Continued analysis reduced the options to the first and third, before converging on “dermatofibroma” after incorporating additional visual cues. This step-wise narrowing underscores the reliability and clinical plausibility of Lingshu’s decision-making process.

- 6.2 Medical Diagnosis

###### Figure 12 compares the diagnostic reasoning of Lingshu with that of the second-best model, InternVL3, on a medical diagnosis case. Guided by the dome-shaped retinal elevation observed in the image, Lingshu initially considers two differential diagnoses, “macular edema” and “macular hole,” and subsequently converges on “macular edema” after incorporating additional clinical cues such as subretinal fluid accumulation and cystoid spaces. InternVL3, by contrast, issues an incorrect verdict with unwarranted confidence, neither assessing alternative hypotheses nor integrating ancillary visual evidence. This discrepancy aligns with the broader modality analysis in §6.1, highlighting Lingshu’s more clinically grounded and cautious diagnostic strategy, resulting in more dependable outcomes.

Question: What is the specific abnormality present in this image? Please solve this stepby-step. To determine the specific abnormality present in this retinal image, I will first examine the overall structure and appearance of the retina. The image shows a clear view of the optic disc, which appears to be of normal size and shape. The retinal vessels are visible and appear to be of normal caliber and distribution. The macula, located in the central part of the retina, does not show any obvious signs of edema or hemorrhage. There are no visible signs of diabetic retinopathy, such as microaneurysms, dot-blot hemorrhages, or neovascularization. The retinal background does not show any signs of exudates or cotton wool spots. The overall retinal pigmentation appears normal, and there are no areas of depigmentation or hyperpigmentation. Based on this detailed examination, the retina appears to be within normal limits, and there is no evidence of any retinal pathology. ### Final Answer: Normal

###### MRI

Question: What can be seen in the image? Please solve the problem step-bystep.

[Figure 79]

To interpret the medical image, we first identify the type of scan. This appears to be an MRI of the lumbar spine, given the axial view and the structures visible. The central structure is the spinal canal, surrounded by the vertebral body. The dark areas on either side are likely the psoas muscles, and the bright areas are likely the intervertebral discs. The key focus should be on any abnormalities in the spinal canal or surrounding structures. In this image, there is a noticeable herniation of the intervertebral disc material into the spinal canal, which is compressing the thecal sac. This is indicative of a lumbar disc herniation, which can cause symptoms such as pain, numbness, or weakness in the lower extremities. ### Final Answer: Lumbar disc herniation

Question: What part is shown in this ultrasound image? Please solve the problem step-by-step. To determine the part shown in this ultrasound image, we start by analyzing the image characteristics. The image is a grayscale ultrasound, which is commonly used for imaging soft tissues. The orientation and the structures visible suggest that this is a transverse view. The image shows a rounded, fluid-filled structure, which is typical of a gestational sac seen in early pregnancy. The presence of this sac, along with the surrounding myometrium, indicates that this is an obstetric ultrasound. The uterus is the primary organ visualized in obstetric ultrasounds, especially when assessing early pregnancy. Therefore, based on the visual cues and the typical use of ultrasound in obstetrics, the part shown in this image is the uterus. ### Final Answer: Uterus

Question:PleasesolveWhattheproblemistheabnormalitystep-by-stepshowninthisimage? First,IobservetheOCTscan,whichprovidesacross-sectionalview Ultrasound of the retina. I note the presence of a full-thickness macular hole, which is a break in the central part of the retina leading to a loss of retinal tissue. This is evident from the gap in the retinal layers at the macula. Additionally, I see retinal schisis, which is a splitting of the retinal layers. This is indicated by the separation and splitting of the retinal layers, visible as distinct layers that are not normally separated. The combination of a full-thickness macular hole and retinal schisis is a complex retinal condition that can significantly affect vision. ### Final Answer: Full-thickness macular hole with retinal schisis

Question: What type of abnormality is present in this image? Please solve this step-by-step

Question: Which type of tissue is visible in the image? Please solve this step-by-step.

We begin by examining the structural characteristics present. The image shows a collection of large, clear spaces that are separated by thin, fibrous septa. These spaces are characteristic of adipose tissue, which is composed of adipocytes, or fat cells. Adipocytes typically appear as large, empty spaces in histological sections due to the extraction of lipids during processing. The thin septa are composed of connective tissue, which is consistent with the organization of adipose tissue. The presence of these large, round, clear spaces is a hallmark feature of adipose tissue, distinguishing it from other tissue types such as muscle, connective tissue, or epithelial tissue, which have different structural characteristics. Therefore, based on the visual cues and the typical histological appearance of adipose tissue, the tissue in the image is identified as adipose tissue. ### Final Answer: Adipose

... This could indicate a lesion or abnormality. The lesion appears to be relatively small and has a somewhat uniform color, which might suggest a benign condition. The presence of hair follicles and the overall appearance of the skin suggest that this could be a common skin condition. The differential diagnosis for skin lesions includes seborrheic keratosis, basal cell carcinoma, and dermatofibroma, among others. Given the uniformity and the lack of irregular borders or significant color variation, a benign lesion such as seborrheic keratosis or dermatofibroma is more likely. However, without more specific features such as a waxy appearance or a central umbilication, it is challenging to definitively identify the lesion. The most likely diagnosis, considering the uniformity and common presentation, is a dermatofibroma, … ### Final Answer: dermatofibroma

1. Begin by examining the CT image provided, which is an axial view of the abdomen. The liver is located in the upper right quadrant of the image. 2. Look for any irregularities in the liver's appearance. Normally, the liver should have a uniform texture and be homogenous in density. 3. Identify any areas that appear different from the surrounding liver tissue. In this image, there is a distinct area in the liver that appears lighter or darker than the rest of the liver tissue, indicating a potential abnormality. 4. Consider common liver abnormalities that could present as a distinct area on a CT scan. These include liver cysts, hemangiomas, metastases, or primary liver tumors such as hepatocellular carcinoma. 5. Evaluate the characteristics of the lesion: its size, shape, and borders. The lesion in this image appears to be wellcircumscribed and distinct from the surrounding liver tissue, which is typical of a liver lesion. 6. Based on the visual evidence and common presentations of liver abnormalities, conclude that the abnormality present in this image is a liver lesion. ### Final Answer: Liver Lesion

First, I will examine the overall quality and orientation of the chest X-ray image to ensure it is properly positioned and clear. The image appears to be a frontal view of the chest, with the ribs, spine, and clavicles clearly visible. Next, I will assess the lung fields for any signs of abnormal opacities, masses, or consolidation. The lung fields appear clear without any visible lesions or abnormal shadows. I will also check the heart size and shape to rule out any cardiomegaly or structural abnormalities. The heart appears to be of normal size and shape. Additionally, I will inspect the bony structures, including the ribs and spine, for any fractures or deformities. The bony structures appear intact and normal. Finally, I will review the diaphragm and costophrenic angles for any signs of effusion or elevation. The diaphragm and costophrenic angles appear normal. Based on this thorough examination, there are no visible signs of abnormalities in the image. ### Final Answer: No

- Figure 11 Case studies on Lingshu in visual question answering across various medical imaging modalities.

- 6.3 Medical Knowledge

Beyond its proficiency in clinical image interpretation, Lingshu exhibits sustained mastery of specialised biomedical knowledge. As depicted in Figure 13, Lingshu clearly interprets the intricate processes occurring within synapses. Notably, it precisely identifies the synapse type as noradrenergic, based on a thorough understanding of neurotransmitter and receptor interactions. This is in stark contrast to the original Qwen2.5VL model, which, while adept at describing synaptic processes, fails to accurately classify them, a crucial piece of information. Moreover, the Qwen2.5-VL produces a great amount of incoherent or irrelevant content, a sign of unreliability in its understanding and application of medical knowledge.

- 6.4 Public Health

As shown in Figure 14, a public health case, Lingshu precisely extracts the relevant elements from the cohort-study table, identifying incidence rates of 58 per 100,000 in the smoking (exposed) cohort and 5 per 100,000 among non-smokers. It then applies the standard formula, subtracting the latter from the former to obtain an attributable risk of 53 per 100,000. This example underscores Lingshu’s capacity to interpret tabular data accurately, implement appropriate public-health calculations, and articulate the population-level implications of those results.

- 6.5 Report Generation

- Figure 15 presents an X-ray report produced by Lingshu. It rigorously follows the conventional radiological structure, i.e., distinct “Findings” followed by an “Impression.” Within the Findings, it correctly delineates suspected abnormalities involving both the cardiac silhouette and pulmonary parenchyma. Furthermore, Lingshu exhibits clinical insight by appending actionable recommendations, such as obtaining a follow-up radiograph after diuretic therapy. These results indicate that the model not only detects radiographic

### Diagnosis

InternVL3: To analyze the specific abnormality shown in this image, let's break it down step by step:

Lingshu: Upon examining the image, we notice a notable elevation in the central region of the retina, which is indicative of a macular abnormality. The macula is the central part of the retina responsible for sharp vision, and any elevation or distortion here can suggest pathology. The key features to look for in this context include the presence of a dome-shaped elevation, which is often associated with macular edema or a macular hole. Macular edema is characterized by fluid accumulation in the macula, leading to swelling and elevation. In this image, the central elevation and the appearance of the retinal layers suggest fluid accumulation beneath the retina, which is consistent with macular edema. This is further supported by the presence of cystoid spaces within the retina, which are typical of fluid-filled cysts seen in cystoid macular edema. Therefore, based on the visual cues of retinal elevation and cystoid spaces, the specific abnormality shown in this image is macular edema. ### Final Answer: Macular edema

- 1. **Analyze the Layers**: - The retina has several distinct layers, and each layer has a specific appearance in an OCT scan. The layers include the retinal nerve fiber layer, ganglion cell layer, inner plexiform layer, inner nuclear layer, outer plexiform layer, outer nuclear layer, and the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE).
- 2. **Look for Abnormalities**: - In this image, there is a noticeable disruption in the normal architecture of the retina. Specifically, there is a large, dark area in the central part of the scan, which suggests a significant structural change.
- 3. **Interpret the Findings**: - The dark area in the center is indicative of a full-thickness defect in the retina. This is characteristic of a macular hole, which is a small break in the macula, an area in the retina responsible for central vision.
- 4. **Conclusion**: - The specific abnormality shown in this image is a macular hole. This condition can cause blurred or distorted central vision and is often associated with aging, but it can also be caused by trauma or other eye conditions.

Question: What is the abnormality shown in this image?

Question: What is this?

Lingshu: To determine what is depicted in the image, I will analyze the visual elements and the context provided. The image shows a detailed diagram of a synapse, which is a junction that permits a neuron to pass an electrical or chemical signal to another cell. Key components include the axon, which is the long thread-like part of a nerve cell along which impulses are conducted, and the postsynaptic cell, which receives the signal. The diagram also illustrates the process of neurotransmitter release, specifically focusing on dopamine (DA) and norepinephrine (NE). The

presence of enzymes like MAO (monoamine oxidase) and PNMT (phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase) suggests the synthesis and breakdown of neurotransmitters. The image also includes

receptors such as α1, α2, β1, and β2, which are part of the adrenergic receptor system, indicating the type of synapse depicted. Given these elements, the image is likely depicting a

noradrenergic synapse, where norepinephrine is the primary neurotransmitter. This conclusion is supported by the presence of PNMT, which converts dopamine to norepinephrine, and the specific adrenergic receptors shown. ### Final Answer: noradrenergic synapse

Medical Knowledge Qwen2.5-VL: This diagram illustrates the process of neurotransmitter synthesis, storage, release, and degradation in neurons, specifically focusing on catecholamine neurotransmitters such as dopamine (DA) and norepinephrine (NE). Here's a breakdown of what each part represents:

[Figure 87]

1. Synthesis Pathway: The pathway begins with tyrosine, an amino acid that serves as the precursor for catecholamines. Tyrosine → L-DOPA (dihydroxyphenylalanine): Catalyzed by the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) within the neuron’s cytoplasm. L-DOPA → Dopamine (DA): Catalyzed by aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase (DDC/AADC). DA can be further converted to NE: Dopamine → Norepinephrine (NE): Catalyzed by phenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase (PNMT, shown at top right).

The model interprets the patient’s concerns, proposes plausible differential diagnoses, directs the individual to the relevant clinical specialty, and specifies suitable diagnostic tests. Such performance underscores Lingshu’s promise as an effective assistant for medical consultations and broader healthcare support.

The rapid development of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has achieved tremendous improvements across various domains, which has sparked widespread interest in their applications within the medical field and driven significant progress in this area, highlighting their enormous potential within healthcare scenarios (Tian et al., 2023; AlSaad et al., 2024). Early endeavors attempt to combine LLMs with specialized medical visual encoders through a linear transformation layer to establish vision-language alignment for medical image understanding and analysis (Li et al., 2023a; Moor et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023; Zhang et al.,

##### Public Health

To calculate the attributable risk (AR) from the given data, we need to follow these steps:

- 1. **Identify the incidence rates in both groups**:

- - The incidence rate in the exposure group (smokers) is 58 per 100,000.
- - The incidence rate in the non-exposure group (non-smokers) is 5 per 100,000.

- 2. **Calculate the attributable risk (AR)**:

- - AR is calculated as the difference between the incidence rate in the exposed group and the incidence rate in the non-exposed group.
- - AR = Incidence rate in exposed group - Incidence rate in non-exposed group
- - AR = 58 - 5
- - AR = 53

Therefore, the attributable risk (AR) is 53 per 100,000. This means that for every 100,000 people, there are 53 more cases of lung cancer in smokers compared to non-smokers.

In parallel, widely used proprietary models have integrated medical knowledge into their platforms, such as Med-Gemini (DeepMind, 2024b) and Med-PaLM (Singhal et al., 2023a,b), and achieve strong performance on diverse medical tasks (Xie et al., 2024; Saab et al., 2024; Yang et al., 2024; Aydin and Karaarslan, 2025; Arora et al., 2025). Beyond general medical MLLMs, many studies also explore specialized MLLMs tailored to particular diseases or clinical contexts to support better targeted downstream applications, such as models developed specifically for pathology (Lu et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024c; Zhao et al., 2024a; Seyfioglu et al., 2025), radiology (Hyland et al., 2024; Christensen et al., 2024; Shui et al., 2025; Zambrano Chaves et al., 2025; Pai et al., 2025; Tanno et al., 2025), ophthalmology (Deng et al., 2024), pan-cancer analysis (Keyl et al., 2025), specific cancer types (Sammut et al., 2022; Pai et al., 2024; Niu et al., 2025), etc. Furthermore, building on the capabilities of medical MLLMs, researchers have initiated the development of medical agents that extend model functionality through integration with external medical tools, as illustrated by systems like AgentClinic (Schmidgall et al., 2025), Agent Hospital (Li et al., 2025a), AIME (DeepMind, 2024a), and MedAgent-Pro (Wang et al., 2025b). In contrast, our work focuses on developing a multimodal foundation model that accommodates diverse medical modalities and supports tasks such as question answering, diagnosis, report generation, and diverse clinical applications.

#### Medical Support

Based on the information provided, it sounds like your son may be experiencing a persistent respiratory issue. Here are some potential causes and recommendations for next steps:

- 1. Chronic bronchitis: This is a condition where the airways become inflamed and produce excess mucus, leading to a persistent cough and green phlegm. It is often caused by repeated respiratory infections or exposure to irritants like cigarette smoke.
- 2. Allergic bronchitis: This is a type of bronchitis that is triggered by allergies. It can cause a persistent cough and green phlegm, along with other allergy symptoms like sneezing and itchy eyes.
- 3. Asthma: While asthma typically causes wheezing and shortness of breath, it can also cause a persistent cough and green phlegm in some cases.
- 4. Sinusitis: This is an inflammation of the sinuses that can cause a persistent cough and green phlegm. It is often caused by a bacterial or viral infection.
- 5. Bronchiectasis: This is a condition where the airways become damaged and scarred, leading to a persistent cough and green phlegm. It is often caused by repeated respiratory infections or exposure to irritants. To determine the underlying cause of your son's persistent cough and green phlegm, it is recommended that you schedule an appointment with a pediatrician or a pulmonologist. They can perform a physical examination, review your son's medical history, and order appropriate tests (such as a chest X-ray or a lung function test) to help determine the underlying cause. Additionally, they can provide recommendations for treatment and management of the condition.

- 8 Conclusion, Limitations, and Future Work

- 8.1 Conclusion

In this work, we introduce Lingshu, a domain-specialized multimodal foundation model designed for medical AI, addressing key challenges in medical data construction, model training, and evaluation. By unifying large-scale, high-quality medical and general-domain corpora with a comprehensive data curation pipeline, encompassing image captions, QA pairs, and CoT annotations, Lingshu acquires an expansive and diverse knowledge base. Our multi-stage training paradigm progressively enhances the model’s medical understanding and problem-solving skills. Besides, we also explore the potential of incorporating advanced reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards to further boost performance. Beyond model development, we emphasize the importance of evaluation standardization in the medical domain, and introduce MedEvalKit, a unified framework that consolidates multiple multimodal and textual benchmarks while enforcing standardized evaluation. This toolkit enables fair, reproducible, and transparent comparisons across models. Extensive experiments confirm the model’s superiority. Across a broad spectrum of medical VQA and report generation tasks, Lingshu consistently surpasses the open-source baselines and narrows the gaps to proprietary models. Overall, Lingshu and MedEvalKit provide a high-performing model, a robust evaluation toolkit, and empirically grounded guidelines on data curation, staged training, and evaluation. These contributions represent a step forward in aligning MLLMs with real-world medical applications.

- 8.2 Limitations Despite Lingshu’s promising performance across various medical tasks, several limitations remain:

Data Quality and Diversity: While extensive medical multimodal and textual data are collected and synthesized, yielding notable gains. Dataset quality and diversity remain limited. Open-source medical multimodal data often exhibit low annotation accuracy, poor image resolution, and uneven modality distribution. Additionally, in the absence of full expert medical supervision, many samples are generated using proprietary models, which may introduce severe hallucinations and factual errors. Despite rigorous quality control and manual verification, such issues persist and may hinder the model’s generalizability to downstream tasks.

Model Performance and Generalization: Although Lingshu achieves promising results across several medical benchmarks, particularly in question answering and report generation, it still underperforms compared to state-of-the-art proprietary models. Moreover, its generalization to broader and more diverse medical tasks remains insufficiently explored. Enhancing its capabilities through the inclusion of additional downstream

scenarios and modality types is promising but entails substantial challenges in data integration, preprocessing, and model design.

Training Paradigm and Reinforcement Learning: While we validate the effectiveness of our data strategy and training paradigm through ablation studies, the optimal data mixture and training configuration remain insufficiently explored. Our exploration of RLVR in medical settings is preliminary; although it offers moderate results in downstream tasks, the overall impact is limited, and a deeper understanding of its effective application in medical contexts is still needed.

- 8.3 Future Work

Building on Lingshu, we identify several directions for future work to address current limitations and further enhance the model’s capabilities:

High-Quality Medical Data Construction: Given the scarcity of high-quality multimodal medical data, it is crucial to increase efforts in constructing and curating more diverse, enriched, and high-quality medical image-text datasets. A key challenge is that medical data quality often requires expert evaluation, which is resource-intensive and infeasible to scale. To address this, it is essential to build robust data generation and quality control systems, including specialized assessment models and fine-grained data synthesis pipelines. Incorporating human-in-the-loop mechanisms for iterative refinement may further improve the efficiency and reliability of the data production process.

Toward Comprehensive Medical Multimodal Benchmarking: Current medical multimodal benchmarks fall short of capturing real-world clinical complexity, limiting their ability to evaluate model utility in practical downstream tasks. The recent release of HealthBench (Arora et al., 2025) by OpenAI—a realistic, open-ended evaluation framework for assessing LLMs across professional dimensions—highlights the need for similarly comprehensive and application-aligned benchmarks in the medical multimodal domain.

Model Expansion: Exploring advanced model architectures tailored to medical multimodal scenarios is essential. Medical data encompasses not only general formats of image and video sequence but also 3D imaging (e.g., CT, MRI), ultra-high-resolution images (e.g., histopathology WSI), and molecular, protein, and genomic data. Although existing frameworks (DeepMind, 2024b) can be adapted to these modalities through optimized data pipelines, such adaptations may introduce information loss and limit the model’s ability to capture subtle variations in medical modalities. Future work will focus on extending Lingshu to natively support WSI, 3D imaging, and omics data, enabling seamless integration and comprehensive understanding across diverse medical modalities.

Post-Training Techniques: Further exploration of post-training techniques is essential, particularly in adapting reinforcement learning for medical MLLMs to better align outputs with task-specific goals and contextual demands. Unlike the logic-driven nature of mathematical or programming reasoning, medical reasoning is predominantly knowledge-driven, relying on domain expertise and clinical experience. This distinction underscores the necessity for tailored reinforcement learning approaches in medical contexts, including the use of specialized reward functions, custom reward models, and process-level supervision.

Evaluation: Currently, MedEvalKit primarily assesses MLLM capabilities within evaluation metrics from general domains. We have attempted to incorporate certain domain-specific metrics into evaluations for particular tasks, such as report generation. In future work, it is crucial to introduce medical-specific evaluation measures, such as the Concordance Index (c-index), Clinical Efficacy Score, and Decision Curve Analysis, to assess model performance in real medical applications. Additionally, exploring methodologies for integrating human expert evaluation to enhance model credibility and safety indicates another promising direction for future investigation.

Roadmap of Lingshu: This work marks our initial effort in the medical domain. Future developments will focus on enhancing Lingshu through improved and diversified medical datasets and benchmarks, exploring more effective post-training strategies tailored to medical tasks, scaling to larger model sizes, and optimizing performance for specific applications such as report generation, diagnosis, and staging prediction. We also plan to expand language support and develop efficient, task-oriented agent systems based on Lingshu to address the diverse needs of real-world clinical scenarios.

# Appendix

- A More Details about Data Curation

- A.1 Model-based response cleaning for patient-doctor dialogue datasets We show the prompt for model-based response cleaning for patient-doctor dialogue datasets in Table 11.

- Table 11 The prompt used for model-based response cleaning for patient-doctor dialogue datasets.

Response to patient: {response}

Revise the above response in a tone of an emphatic health-care agent. You should offer reliable information about medical conditions, but avoid giving explicit diagnosis and prescription. Add suggestions about which kinds of doctors the patient should consult. Include a disclaimer statement saying that it is not a definitive diagnosis. Begin the revised response with "Revised response:".

A.2 Medical VQA Data Synthesis

We display the prompt of our self-instruct based method for medical VQA data synthesis in Table 12.

- Table 12 The prompt used for synthesizing medical VQA data in our self-instruct based method.

- A.3 Medical reasoning data distillation

Given a medical image and its description, generate a clinically relevant multiple-choice question that could be asked to a medical professional.

If the given medical image matches its desription, your output should be in JSON format with three keys:

- - “question": A medically appropriate question related to the image.
- - “answer": Correct answer to the question.
- - “wrong answers": A list of wrong but relevant answers that could be given by the medical professional. There should be 1 to 3 options. The format is [“answer1", “answer2", ...] If the given medical image does not matche its desription, simply output "Error: the input description does not match the input image." The question should be directly answerable from the image.

Below are some examples of questions and answers for other images:

- {seed_example_1}
- {seed_example_2}

Now, use the following image and the image caption to generate the question: Image caption: {caption}

###### We depict the prompts for distilling the CoT reasoning process from GPT4-o into medical open-ended VQA datasets and medical multiple-choice VQA datasets in Figure 13 and Figure 14 respectively. The prompt used

###### for checking the quality of the generated reasoning traces is displayed in Table 15.

- Table 13 The prompt used for annotating CoT reasoning process for open-ended VQA data.

You are a medical expert specializing in interpreting medical images. The user will provide you with the following inputs:

- - A medical image
- - A question about the image
- - The groundtruth answer

Your task is to simulate a step-by-step diagnostic reasoning process that leads to the ground-truth answer. However, you must assume you do not know the ground-truth answer in advance, and you should not reference it explicitly during your reasoning. Please do not give empty output.

- - Carefully analyze both the image and the question.
- - Reason step by step, as a medical expert would, using visual and textual cues to reach a logical conclusion.
- - The reasoning should be concise, clear, and clinically sound.
- - After the reasoning, reveal the correct answer by copying the ground-truth answer.

Output in JSON Format:

{ "reasoning": "<step-by-step reasoning process here>", "answer": "<groundtruth answer>" }

Question: {question} Groundtruth answer: {answer}

- A.4 Prompts for Medical Long-form Caption Synthesis

We detail the prompts used for medical long-form caption synthesis across various stages. The prompt for Stage 3 (factual knowledge annotation) is presented in Table 16. For Stage 4 (annotation with doctor preference), the prompts tailored for different types of medical images are displayed in Tables 17, 18, 19, and 20. Finally, the summarization prompt for Stage 5 is depicted in Table 21. In this Stage 5 prompt, the variable {doctor_preferred_features} should be replaced by the doctor-preferred features specified in Tables 22 and 23, according to the type of the source image.

###### B More Details about MedEvalKit

The judgment prompt used for GPT-4.1 (OpenAI, 2025a) in the LLM-as-a-Judge module is presented in Table 24.

For the report generation task, we develop a multi-metric evaluation approach that integrates semantic and model-based metrics. Our MedEvalKit supports the following metrics, and in this paper, we selectively present a subset of these.

The semantic evaluation metrics:

• BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002): BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) is a widely adopted metric in machine translation and text generation tasks. It evaluates the quality of generated text by measuring n-gram precision between candidate and reference texts, with scores ranging from 0 to 1. This metric

assesses the overlap of contiguous sequences of n words between the generated report and the reference standard.

- • Rouge (Lin, 2004): ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) comprises a set of metrics designed to automatically assess summary quality by comparing generated summaries against reference human-authored summaries. This metric evaluates the overlap between the generated text and reference summaries, focusing particularly on recall-oriented measurements.
- • METEOR (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005): METEOR (Metric for Evaluation of Translation with Explicit ORdering) is an automated metric designed for machine translation evaluation, which assesses translation quality based on the concept of flexible uni-gram matching between machine-generated translations and human reference translations. This metric incorporates semantic matching principles beyond simple word overlap.
- • CIDEr (Vedantam et al., 2015): CIDEr (Consensus-based Image Description Evaluation) is a metric that quantifies the similarity between generated sentences and a collection of human-authored reference sentences. This metric specifically measures how well the generated content aligns with human consensus,

- Table 15 The prompt used for checking the quality of generated CoT reasoning traces.

You are a medical expert. The user will provide you with the following inputs:

- - A question related to an image.
- - A step-by-step diagnostic reasoning process that leads to a predicted answer.
- - The groundtruth answer.

Your task is to check whether the predicted answer in the reasoning process is consistent with the ground-truth answer. If the predicted answer in the reasoning process is inconsistent with the ground-truth answer. Please first output "Inconsistent. " Then give a short explanation. Otherwise, please first output "Consistent. " Then give a short explanation.

effectively capturing the semantic similarity between machine-generated and reference descriptions. The model-based evaluation metrics:

- • BERTScore (Zhang et al., 2020): BERTScore is a neural-based evaluation metric that leverages pretrained BERT models (Devlin et al., 2019) to assess textual similarity. This metric computes the cosine similarity between BERT embeddings of model-generated radiology reports and ground-truth reference reports, providing a more semantically nuanced evaluation that captures contextual relationships between texts.
- • SembScore (Smit et al., 2020): SembScore (CheXbert Labeler Vector Similarity) is a domain-specific metric developed for radiology report evaluation. This metric calculates the cosine similarity between vectors of 14 pathological indicators, which are automatically extracted by the CheXbert labeler from both model-generated and ground-truth radiology reports. This specialized metric focuses specifically on assessing the clinical content alignment between generated and reference reports.
- • RadGraph-F1 (Yu et al., 2023): RadGraph-F1 serves as a specialized metric for radiology report evaluation. It quantifies the overlap of clinical entities and their relationships extracted by RadGraph (Jain et al.,

2021) from both candidate and reference reports. This metric provides a structured assessment of how well the generated reports capture the underlying clinical relationships present in the reference reports.

- • RadCliQ-v1 (Yu et al., 2023)7: RadCliQ is a comprehensive metric designed for evaluating radiology report generation, integrating multiple complementary measures including BLEU, BERTScore, SembScore, and RadGraph-F1 to provide a holistic assessment of report quality.
- • RaTEScore (Zhao et al., 2024b)8: RaTEScore is an entity-aware metric specifically designed for radiology report evaluation. This metric emphasizes critical medical entities, including diagnostic findings and anatomical details, while demonstrating robustness to complex medical synonyms and sensitivity to negation expressions.
- • GREEN (Ostmeier et al., 2024)9: GREEN (Generated Radiology Report Evaluation and Error Notation) is an LLM-based metric designed for evaluating generated radiology reports. This metric leverages large

language models to identify and interpret clinically significant errors in both quantitative and qualitative aspects of candidate reports. The evaluation framework enables a comprehensive assessment of clinical accuracy and relevance in generated reports.

Table 25 summarizes the statistics of the evaluation benchmarks utilized in the MedEvalKit framework.

###### Table 16 The prompt used for the factual knowledge annotation stage of medical long caption synthesis.

You are provided with a biomedical image from a medical dataset, the disease type (or organ name if there is no disease) of the dataset (‘Disease or organ‘), the medical Knowledge of the disease (‘Knowledge‘), a coarse caption (‘Coarse Caption‘) of the image and the medical imaging methods (‘Modality‘). Your task is to answer the following questions based on the image, bounding box (if provided), caption, disease type and disease knowledge, and condense your answers into caption-styled text.

- ### question1 Give me a detailed description of the image, including type of the image, organs in the image, approximate location of these organs and relavant locations of these organs and any medical devices (if present) visible in the image as detailedly as possible. Note when answering question1:

- 1. You can use all the meta infomation I provided. But never mention that this information has been given. Your should NEVER mention anything about the bounding box like the contour itself and its outline. Assuming you are introducing to someone who can only see the original image.
- 2. If there is some statistical information provided, like the damage area or the relative damage ratio, etc., you should mention it in your response.
- 3. Not all disease knowledge is relevant to this image; only utilize disease knowledge pertinent to the condition depicted in this image for analysis.
- 4. The coarse caption may not explicitly describe the image, for example, there may appear multiple organs in the caption. You should utilize your knowledge to figure out the most ONE organ and ONE disease to give your description.
- 5. Do not explain or emphasize your analysis. Do not suggest or indicate any consequent effects of the disease.

- ### question2 Specify the specific location of the diesase or the organ in the image and its relative position to other reference objects in the image. Describe what is unusual in this area indicating the disease (color, texture, size and other features). Note when answering question2:

- 1. You can use information from ‘Coarse Caption‘ to locate the disease or the organ. If no, you need to locate the disease or organ by yourself.
- 2. The image may contain multiple bounding boxs, and the contents of these contours may not necessarily represent the affected areas. Therefore, you need to first answer the questions based on the contents within each bounding box. Afterward, analyze the location of the disease based on your answers.
- 3. Do not use phrase "bounding box" in your response. The bounding box if provided is only a visual aid for your reference. Do not say something correlates with or matches any of provided information. Assuming you are introducing to someone who cannot see the bounding box and the provided textual information. If you want to mention the bounding box, use the position of the bounding box (e.g. the top-left side of the image). Do not contain phrases "caption", "medical annotation", "medical knowledge".
- 4. Do not say anything that is not needed in your analysis, like introduction of the disease and medical equipments.
- 5. Do not explain or emphasize your analysis.

- ### question3 What may be the relationship between the content in the bounding box and other regions (others being cause of the disease/jointly affected by the diseases/one affect the others/relative positional relationships)? Why and is it possible? Note when answering question3:

- 1. Utilize external knowledge, if possible, to choose relationships and give necessary analysis.
- 2. You can only give an explanation to your choice within two sentence.
- 3. Do not summarize what you’ve said.
- 4. Do not emphasize your analysis. ### Integrate Information Describe your answers in a descriptive sentence, not in a "Question-Answer" style. Combine and slightly shorten your answers to the above three questions into a coherent text, keeping as much information of your answers as possible. Note when integrating information and outputing your response:

- 1. Don’t respond saying you’re unable to assist with requests.
- 2. You should only output your combined and shorteded text in the "caption" filed.

- Table 17 The prompts used for the annotation with doctor preference stage of medical long caption synthesis for MRI, X-ray, and CT images. MRI instruction:

Write a description of the MRI image to include the following information, if these information are visually discernible from the image:

- 1. The sequence used (e.g., T1-weighted, T2-weighted, FLAIR, etc.)
- 2. Plane/orientation of the image (axial, coronal, sagittal)
- 3. Describe the anatomical structures visible and their normal or abnormal appearance (e.g., brain lobes, ventricles, midline structures).
- 4. Identify and describe any abnormal findings, shape, location and effects (e.g. compression)
- 5. Describe signal intensity: hyperintense, hypointense, or isointense

X-ray instruction:

Write a description of the X-ray image to include the following information, if these information are visually discernible from the image:

- 1. Specific area of the body being imaged (e.g. chest area, lungs, knee, femur, etc.)
- 2. Body part or organ being examined, either fully or partially
- 3. Anatomical planes (e.g. Axial, Sagittal, and Coronal), specific X-ray imaging projections (e.g. AP, PA, lateral view, oblique view, etc.), and clearly discernible left vs right side (either clearly labeled in the image, or clearly determined from image).
- 4.

- Table 21 The prompt used for the summarization stage of medical long caption synthesis. The variable {doctor_preferred_features} in the prompt should be replaced by the doctor preferred features in Tables 22 and 23 according to the type of the source image.

You are provided with a biomedical image (which may contain multiple bounding boxes emphasizing the related disease or organs), the disease type (or organ name if there is no disease) of the dataset (‘Disease or organ’), the medical knowledge of the disease (‘Knowledge’), a coarse caption (‘Coarse Caption’) of the image, and the medical imaging method used to create the image (‘Modality’). In addition, detailed captions for many aspects of the medical image (‘Detailed Captions’) are also provided. Your task is to combine the above detailed captions into a long caption for the entire image.

- 1. You can also use the coarse caption, disease type, image modality and disease knowledge, which may contain additional useful information. But never mention that this information has been given.
- 2. Caption 0 in ‘Detailed Captions’ is a model-generated description, including some doctor-preferred features: {doctor_preferred_features}. Caption 1 focus on specific diseases and are annotated by humans, which are

more trustworthy. Consequently, if any pieces of information in Caption 0 does not contradict Caption 1 or is not mentioned in Caption 1, please keep them, especially the location, the size and the name of the disease. If there is a contradiction, you should only keep the information from Caption 1.

- 3. ‘Detailed Captions’ may not explain all bounding boxes. Sometimes some small ones are not mentioned. In this case, in addition to combining the above detailed captions, please also provide explanations for these unmentioned smaller bounding boxes.
- 4. You should NEVER mention anything about the bounding box, like the contour itself or its outline. The bounding box, if present, is only a visual aid for your reference. Assume you are introducing the image to someone who cannot see the bounding box.
- 5. If there is some statistical information provided, like the damage area or the relative damage ratio, etc., you should mention it in your response.
- 6. For some critical information, like the damage area(s) and its position(s), you should explain one by one in the combined caption.
- 7. Not all disease knowledge is relevant to this image; only utilize disease knowledge pertinent to the condition depicted in this image for analysis.
- 8. Do not explain or emphasize your analysis. Do not suggest or indicate any consequent effects of the disease.
- 9. Do not contain phrases "caption", "medical annotation", "medical knowledge".
- 10. Do not say anything that is not needed in your analysis, like introduction of the disease and medical treatments.
- 11. Do not explain or emphasize your analysis.
- 12. For CT MRI, Xray, GI tract or ultrasound image, if it contains multiple organs, please organize your description organ by organ. You should also include other organs information even if they are healthy. For Histopathology image, you should first describe the overall information, then go deep into the specific areas.
- 13. When integrating the information and outputting your response: (1) Don’t respond by saying you’re unable to assist with the requests. (2) You should only output your combined text in the "caption" field.
