Multi-turn problem solving is critical yet challenging for Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) to reflect on their reasoning and revise from feedback. Existing Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) methods train large reasoning models on a single-turn paradigm. However, we observe that models trained with existing RL paradigms often fail to explore alternative reasoning paths across multiple turns and lack the capacity for self-reflection, resulting in repetitive and unadapted responses to contextual feedback. We ask: Can LRMs learn to reflect their answers in a multi-turn context? In this work, we find that training models with multi-turn RL using only unary feedback (for example, “Let’s try again”) after wrong answers can improve both single-turn performance and multi-turn reasoning. We introduce Unary Feedback as Observation (UFO) for reinforcement learning, which uses minimal yet common unary user feedback during iterative problem solving. It can be easily applied to existing single-turn RL training setups. Experimental results show that RL training with UFO keeps single-turn performance and improves multi-turn reasoning accuracy by up to 14%, enabling models to reflect on prior failures and refine their reasoning accordingly. To further minimize the number of turns needed for a correct answer while encouraging diverse reasoning when mistakes occur, we design reward structures that guide models to produce careful and deliberate answers in each turn. Our code and models are open source https://github.com/lichengliu03/unary-feedback.

##### 1. Introduction

Large language and reasoning models (LLMs/LRMs) (DeepSeek-AI, 2025; OpenAI, 2024; Yang et al., 2024; Team, 2025) have demonstrated strong capabilities in solving complex tasks such as mathematics problems and code generation. Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) (DeepSeek-AI, 2025; Schulman et al., 2017; Zhou et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2025) further enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs through verifiable reward frameworks (RLVR). However, many real-world applications like chatbots, programming assistants, and educational tools (Xie et al., 2024; Pan et al., 2024; Yao et al., 2023; Shridhar et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2024a) require models to engage in multi-turn problem solving and adapting their reasoning with feedback. Despite this need, it remains underexplored how models trained with single-turn RL can generalize to interactive, multi-turn problem-solving.

In this work, we first observe that single-turn RL can hinder a model’s ability to engage in interactive multi-turn reasoning. Specifically, single-turn-trained models often fail to incorporate

in-context feedback and instead persist with their initial answers across subsequent turns (Figure 1). To quantify this persistence, we define effective answer as a new response that has never been explored in any previous turn by the LLM. In Figure 2, we observed that in 70% of the failed cases, the single-turn-trained models generate exactly the same answer across five turns (i.e. only 1 effective answer). One particular reason for that is that most existing datasets are inherently single-turn and lack signals for iterative exploration. Without such signals, models have limited opportunities to explore diverse reasoning paths or adapt their strategies based on feedback. This challenge motivates our research question: How can we train language models to iteratively explore and refine their reasoning, especially when initial attempts fail and only minimal feedback is available?

Collecting real-world multi-turn user feedback, however, is expensive and logistically difficult. Constrained by this data bottleneck, the existing multiturn framework has been training in automatic feedback such as code interpreter messages (Xie et al., 2024; Pan et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024a) and embodied simulator signals (Shridhar et al., 2021; Zhuang et al., 2025). Although useful, these signals are costly to construct and are still limited in scope (Cao et al., 2025). In light of these limitations, we explore a simple yet effective framework that can leverage static dataset for multi-turn RL training. By inserting minimal verbal feedback ("try again") into the context, we encourage models to revise and explore alternative reasoning paths. We call this Unary Feedback as Observation (UFO), framing interactive problem-solving as Markov Decision Processes (MDP)

where the model only receives unary feedback as its environmental observation.

Through experiments, we show that applying UFO in multi-turn RL effectively encourages interactive reasoning and helps the model explore alternative reasoning paths across turns.

[Figure 18]

- Figure 3 | Comparison of effective (unique) answer ratio (%) before and after RL training. Across single-turn RL methods, the unique answer ratio consistently drops after training across multiple model scales.

Instead of repeating previous answers, UFO trained models adjust their problem-solving strategies based on prior outcomes, leading to a 14% improvement in multi-turn success rates over conventional single-turn RL. Furthermore, we find that the model’s ability to self-reflect and adapt its reasoning generalizes robustly across diverse out-of-domain tasks.

To further align model behavior with real-world multi-turn reasoning objectives, we propose two guiding principles: minimality, where models should minimize the number of interaction turns needed to reach a correct answer, and diversity, where they should explore varied strategies when faced with failure. To operationalize these principles, we introduce a turn-wise reward decay and an answer repetition penalty which encourage systematic planning and improve reasoning efficiency.

To summarize, our contributions are as follows:

- • We identify that while current single-turn RL training improves reasoning, they can lead to repetitive and degraded outputs in multi-turn, interactive reasoning scenarios.
- • We explore a simple yet effective framework, Unary Feedback as Observation (UFO), to enable multi-turn RL training on existing static single-turn reasoning datasets.
- • We show that turn-wise reward decay and answer repetition penalty could effectively improve multi-turn reasoning minimality and diversity.

##### 2. Reinforcement Learning for LLM Reasoning

###### 2.1. Background

Single-Turn Reinforcement Learning. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a general framework to steer the behavior of LLMs by maximizing expected reward:

𝜃(·|𝑥)[𝑅(𝑥, 𝑦)],

E𝑥∼D, 𝑦∼𝜋

where D is a prompt distribution, 𝜋𝜃, is the LLM policy parameterized by 𝜃, and 𝑅(𝑥, 𝑦) is the reward for response 𝑦. Algorithms such as PPO (Schulman et al., 2017; Ouyang et al., 2022) and GRPO (DeepSeek-AI, 2025; Shao et al., 2024) apply this objective to static datasets, yielding strong single-turn gains in math and code generation.

Multi-Turn Extensions. Though these methods excel at optimizing a policy to produce a correct answer in a single attempt, real-world applications like tutoring, coding assistants, embodied agents demand multi-turn interaction, where a model refines answers across steps under feedback. In domains like programming, automated feedback is readily available from

compilers or unit tests, enabling iterative correction. But for tasks like mathematical reasoning, obtaining such dense feedback is difficult; often, only a final signal of correctness is available.

Recent work has begun addressing the challenge of sparse feedback in reasoning tasks by optimizing full interaction trajectories. For example, CollabLLM (Wu et al., 2025) introduces multi-turn fine-tuning with collaborative simulation and sparse rewards, while RAGEN (Wang et al., 2025) frames reasoning as an MDP to enable delayed credit assignment. However, these methods often depend on custom environments or simulated rewards, limiting scalability. Since most real-world math and code datasets are single-turn and collecting turn-level human feedback is costly, some efforts synthesize proxy signals (Xie et al., 2024; Pan et al., 2024) or build tool-augmented environments (Wang et al., 2024a; Jin et al., 2025; Feng et al., 2025). Despite these workarounds, most training remains fundamentally grounded in single-turn RL paradigms.

These limitations give rise to a fundamental question: Can models trained only with single-turn RL generalize to multi-turn reasoning?

###### 2.2. Single-Turn RL Leads to Collapsed Multi-Turn Reasoning

To answer the question, we need to examine how models trained with single-turn RL perform in multi-turn setting. Practically, users typically offer minimal feedback (e.g., “try again”) and expect the model to adjust its reasoning accordingly. However, we find that single-turn RL models are effective solvers but poor revisers, consistently failing to incorporate feedback.

This phenomenon is illustrated in Figure 1: a pre-trained model refines its answer across turns, while a single-turn RL model fails to revise, repeating its initial output. To quantify this behavior, we use effective answer as our metric, and the results were presented in Figure 3 for off-the-shelf LLMs and Figure 2 for our trained models with single-turn RL. Empirically, after single-turn RL training, LLMs tend to give less effective answers across multiple turns.

Specifically, for off-the-shelf LLMs, we select models fine-tuned with various RL algorithms including PPO (Schulman et al., 2017), GRPO (Shao et al., 2024), DAPO (Yu et al., 2025), and Dr. GRPO (Liu et al., 2025). Details of the models used can be found in the Appendix F. As shown in Figure 3, all models show a noticeable decrease in the unique answer ratio after RL training, and the extent varies by method and model size. For example, under DAPO the effective answer ratio of the 32B model falls from 78.0% to 65.7%, and under Dr. GRPO that of the 1.5B model drops from 38.0% to just 15.4%. On the contrary, GRPO shows more moderate losses (e.g., the

- 0.5B model decreased from 34.0% to 24.3%), and the impact of PPO is also mild (the 7B model went from 57.6% to 51.7%). We also measure how many distinct answers our single-turn RL model provides for questions it fails to answer correctly for 5 consecutive turns (see Section 4.1

for details). As shown in Figure 2, under nearly 70% cases the model provide identical wrong answers across multiple interaction turns.

###### 2.3. Theoretical Analysis

We theoretically analyze why single-turn RL models tend to repeat mistakes in multi-turn settings. This behavior is a predictable consequence of the training process itself, which creates a peaked, low-entropy output distribution (Cui et al., 2025; Yue et al., 2025). To quantify this tendency, we use the collision probability, the likelihood that two independent samples are identical, which is formally defined as:

Coll(𝑞) := ∑︁

𝑞(𝑦 | 𝑥)2. (1)

𝑦

This probability is fundamentally lower-bounded by the distribution’s Shannon Entropy, H(𝑞), as captured by the inequality:

Coll(𝑞) ≥ exp(−H(𝑞)). (2)

We formalize this relationship with greater rigor and provide detailed proofs in Appendix B. This relationship proves that as a model’s policy becomes more deterministic (lower entropy), the probability of repetition is forced to increase. For a static policy unable to learn from feedback, repetition is therefore an inevitable failure mode.

To overcome this limitation, a policy must be able to learn from its interaction history. We formalize this requirement using a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and define two distinct classes of policies. Parallel Policies (Π𝑝𝑎𝑟) correspond to traditional single-turn RL, where 𝑘 answers are sampled independently based only on the initial question. In contrast, Sequential Policies (Π𝑠𝑒𝑞) make decisions based on the full history of interactions, allowing for adaptation after each failure. Since any parallel policy is a special case of a sequential one, it is clear that Π𝑝𝑎𝑟 ⊆ Π𝑠𝑒𝑞, and their expected success rates provably satisfy:

max

E[Succ@𝑘] ≥ max

E[Succ@𝑘]. (3)

𝜋∈Π𝑠𝑒𝑞

𝜋∈Π𝑝𝑎𝑟

This theoretical guarantee stems from the fact that a sequential policy can intentionally avoid previously known errors, thus increasing its subsequent conditional success probability. By Blackwell dominance (Blackwell, 1951), its overall success rate is guaranteed to be at least as high as that of a parallel policy. We extend more detailed analysis in Appendix C.

This highlights a critical gap: single-turn RL is insufficient for multi-turn reasoning. However, acquiring the necessary step-by-step supervision is often infeasible. In light of this, we ask the following question: Can we leverage only the simplest form of supervision, such as “try again”, to simulate multi-turn interaction on static datasets and train models to learn adaptive revision behaviors?

Can minimal feedback alone unlock multi-turn reasoning on static datasets?

##### 3. Training Multi-Turn Reasoning Models with Unary Feedback

###### 3.1. Problem Formulation

We model the process of multi-turn problem solving based on static single-turn datasets as a finite-horizon Markov Decision Process (MDP), defined by the tuple (S, A, P, 𝑅,𝑇max). Here, S

is the state space, A is the action space consisting of all possible answers, P is the transition function defined by the agent–environment interaction, 𝑅 is the reward function, and 𝑇max is the maximum number of interaction steps per episode. At each turn 𝑡, the agent observes a state 𝑠𝑡 ∈ S that encodes the original question 𝑞 and the history of past attempts and feedbacks:

𝑠𝑡 = Concat(𝑞, {(𝑎𝑘, 𝑓𝑘)}𝑡𝑘−=11), (4)

where 𝑎𝑘 denotes the 𝑘-th answer, and 𝑓𝑘 is a feedback token returned by the environment. The agent then generates an answer 𝑎𝑡 ∼ 𝜋𝜃(· | 𝑠𝑡) and receives a scalar reward:

𝑟𝑡 =

1, if 𝑎𝑡 is correct, 0, otherwise.

(5)

The episode ends when the agent provides a correct answer or reaches the maximum number of steps 𝑇max. This formulation grounds the multi-turn learning problem in a standard RL framework.

###### 3.2. Unary Feedback as Observation (UFO)

To implement the MDP described above on static datasets, we propose a simple yet general mechanism called Unary Feedback as Observation (UFO) (Figure 4). This mechanism defines how the state history is constructed and presented to the agent. The key idea is to restrict 𝑓𝑘 in the observation to negative signals only. Specifically, when an answer 𝑎𝑘 is incorrect, the feedback is a generic signal such as TryAgain. When the agent produces a correct answer, the episode terminates immediately. Consequently, no explicit positive confirmation (e.g., Correct) is ever added to the state history. The agent thus only receives unary feedback and must learn to revise its answers based solely on a history of failed attempts.

In practice, the prompt is constructed as a natural-language sequence concatenating all previous attempts and their feedback. For example:

Question: What is the value of ...? Attempt 1: [wrong answer] Feedback: Try Again.

... Attempt K: [correct answer]

This UFO mechanism enables us to transform static single-turn datasets into multi-turn interaction episodes without requiring structural changes, expert annotations, or execution environments. Thus, UFO allows multi-turn RL on LLMs with minimal supervision.

###### 3.3. Reinforcement Learning with Unary Feedback

Given the MDP formulation and the UFO-based observation design, we optimize the agent using RL to learn revision-aware and multi-turn policies. Since the dataset only contains the final-answer accuracy and lacks ground-truth reasoning traces, supervised finetuning is not applicable. Reinforcement learning, in contrast, enables exploration of diverse reasoning strategies under sparse and delayed supervision.

We adopt Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to train the policy 𝜋𝜃, following prior work (Wang et al., 2025; Hu et al., 2025) which shows that a learned critic enables fine-grained

value estimates and stabilizes optimization. At each episode, the agent interacts with a problem over multiple rounds. At each turn 𝑡, it observes input 𝑥𝑡, generates an answer 𝑎𝑡, and receives a binary reward 𝑟𝑡 ∈ {0,1}. The resulting trajectory is defined as:

𝜏 = {(𝑥1, 𝑎1,𝑟1), (𝑥2, 𝑎2,𝑟2), . . . , (𝑥𝑇, 𝑎𝑇,𝑟𝑇)}, (6)

where 𝑇 ⩽ 𝑇max is the number of turns before success or termination. The objective is to maximize the expected return:

###### ∑︁ 𝑇

###### JRL(𝜃) = E𝜏∼𝜋

𝑟𝑡 . (7)

𝜃

𝑡=1

We apply PPO with a clipped surrogate objective. For each training batch, we estimate the advantage 𝐴ˆ𝑡 using a baseline value function and update the policy as:

𝜋𝜃(𝑎𝑡 | 𝑥𝑡) 𝜋𝜃old(𝑎𝑡 | 𝑥𝑡)

𝜋𝜃(𝑎𝑡 | 𝑥𝑡) 𝜋𝜃old(𝑎𝑡 | 𝑥𝑡)

LPPO(𝜃) = E𝑡 min

𝐴ˆ𝑡, clip(

𝐴ˆ𝑡,1 − 𝜀,1 + 𝜀) . (8)

Crucially, the UFO design enables the policy to condition on the full history of failure signals, giving rise to context-sensitive behaviors such as error correction, elimination, and hypothesis refinement—capabilities that are difficult to elicit through static supervision alone.

###### 3.4. Reward Design for Adaptive Reasoning

Binary correctness signals offer a minimal form of supervision, but they could induce suboptimal behavior such as blind trial-and-error or repeated guesses. To encourage more efficient and reflective reasoning, we introduce a trajectory-level reward decay with repetition penalty. Reward decay encourages minimality by favoring trajectories that reach correct answers in fewer turns, thereby promoting concise and purposeful reasoning, while the repetition penalty promotes diversity by penalizing repetitive answers and encouraging the model to explore alternative reasoning strategies upon failure.

Formally, reward decay promotes early success by assigning exponentially diminishing rewards to correct answers produced at later turns:

𝑅𝑡 =

𝛾𝑡, if 𝑎𝑡 is correct, 0, otherwise,

(9)

where 𝛾 ∈ (0,1) is a decay factor that favors solving the problem in fewer turns.

We define the repetition penalty based on the number of effective answers. Let 𝑇 denote the number of turns in the episode, and 𝐸(𝜏) be the number of effective answers in the trajectory 𝜏. We define a normalized penalty term:

𝐸(𝜏) 𝑇

Penalty(𝜏) = 𝜆 · 1 −

, (10)

where 𝜆 > 0 is a tunable penalty weight, and 𝐸(𝜏)/𝑇 measures answer diversity. The penalty is maximized when all answers are identical.

Combining above components, the trajectory-level reward for RL training is defined as: 𝑅 = 𝑅𝑡 − Penalty(𝜏). (11)

To improve stability, we apply a small penalty 𝜂 < 0 for each malformed or missing output across turns. To summarize, the reward is determined by the reasoning correctness at the last turn, answer diversity and format correctness of model answers across turns.

##### 4. Experiments

###### 4.1. Setup

Dataset We conduct major experiments on the MATH subset of MetaMathQA (Yu et al., 2024) dataset (MMQ-Math), where data are augmented from the MATH (Hendrycks et al., 2021) dataset. This environment provides math questions with adequate difficulty, enabling us to observe and analyze its reasoning emergence. We also select eight other widely-used datasets in four different domains to evaluate the generalization ability of UFO: TheoremQA (Chen et al.,

- 2023) evaluates formal mathematics understanding through questions about theorem statements and proofs. GSM8K(Cobbe et al., 2021) focuses on grade-school level arithmetic reasoning. GPQA(Rein et al., 2023) tests graduate-level physics understanding. MMLU-STEM(Hendrycks et al., 2020) is a curated STEM-focused benchmark derived from fifteen scientific and technical subjects within MMLU. HotPotQA (Yang et al., 2018) tests multi-hop factual reasoning across Wikipedia passages, while ConcurrentQA (Arora et al., 2022) focuses on temporal and causal reasoning in concurrent event settings. MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2020) assesses general-knowledge proficiency across fifty-seven academic subjects, and its extension, MMLU-Pro (Wang et al.,
- 2024b) covers more specialized expert domains.

Training Settings We use Qwen-2.5-3B-Instruct (Yang et al., 2024) with PPO for 200 optimization steps on A100 GPUs as main training setting. Each batch samples 𝑃=8 prompts, with 𝑁=16 rollouts per prompt. During training, we experiment with three distinct maximum number of turns per episode, setting 𝑇max to 1, 5, and 10, respectively. For the validation phase, 𝑇max is fixed at 5 turns. In both training and validation, episodes are limited to a maximum of 10 actions in total. Policy updates use PPO with GAE parameters (𝛾, 𝜆) = (1.0,1.0), Adam with 𝛽 = (0.9,0.999), entropy coefficient 10−3. We apply the same training setup to four additional models: Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct, Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, LLaMA3.2-1B-Instruct (AI, 2024), and LLaMA3.2-3B-Instruct, to ensure consistent comparison across architectures and scales.

Baseline and Metrics We compare our method UFO against a single-turn PPO-trained model using parallel sampling. For each problem, the baseline generates 𝑘 independent responses in parallel and is evaluated using standard Pass@k metric. In contrast, our multi-turn model generates responses sequentially with unary feedback after each attempt, and is evaluated using both Succ@k and AvgTurns. Success is recorded if any of the 5 responses is correct. We also conduct ablation studies with different maximum interaction turns (𝑇max) to further analyze the effect of multi-turn training.

We report the following complementary metrics to assess both effectiveness and efficiency.

- • Pass@k (Single-turn baseline). The proportion of problems for which at least one of the k parallel completions is correct. This metric reflects performance when no feedback is used during generation.
- • Succ@k (Multi-turn model) This metric measures the percentage of problems solved within a fixed number of interaction turns. Let 𝜏𝑗 be the number of turns the agent takes to solve problem 𝑞𝑗, or ∞ if it fails. We have:

Succ@k =

1

𝑁

∑︁𝑁

𝑗=1

[𝜏𝑗 ≤ 𝑘]. (12)

We report Succ@1 for single-turn performance, and Succ@5/10 to reflect multi-turn capability.

- • Average Number of Turns (Multi-turn model) To evaluate interaction efficiency, we report the average number of turns the agent takes to solve each problem: AvgTurns = 𝑁1 𝑁𝑗=1 𝑇𝑗.

###### 4.2. Experimental Results and Findings

In this section, we present empirical findings that address three central questions in our study of multi-turn reinforcement learning with unary feedback:

- 1. Section 4.2.1: Does multi-turn RL unlock stronger reasoning than single-turn training?
- 2. Section 4.2.2: Can models effectively revise their answers from sparse feedback alone?
- 3. Section 4.2.3: How do reward shaping strategies impact reasoning efficiency and diversity?

We explore each question in the following subsections, with quantitative analyses and ablation studies. Additional qualitative examples and robustness checks are included in the Appendix.

- 4.2.1. Multi-turn RL Unlocks Higher Upper Bound of LLM Reasoning

We compare models trained with multi-turn RL against single-turn PPO baselines, using Succ@5 on a held-out validation set evaluated at 21 checkpoints across 200 training steps. During validation, each agent is allowed up to 5 interaction turns per problem (𝑘 = 5).

As shown in Figure 5, multi-turn training consistently outperforms the single-turn baseline, achieving up to 14% higher success rate with comparable inference cost. This highlights the benefit of iterative revision under sparse feedback.

Furthermore, we conduct additional experiments comparing various multi-turn training budgets (𝑇max = 1,5,10) while consistently using a 5-turn validation setup. Findings presented in Figure 6 demonstrate that larger training budgets yield enhanced performance relative to the single-turn baseline. Notably, both the 𝑇max = 10 and 𝑇max = 5 configurations deliver more than a 6% relative improvement over single-turn training at their peak, clearly emphasizing the benefits of multi-turn training.

To validate the robustness of these improvements, we expand our analysis by evaluating peak-performing models trained with 𝑇max ∈ {1,5,10} across varied inference-time interaction budgets (𝑘 ∈ {1,2,4,6,8,10}). The results illustrated in Figure 7 reinforce previous observations, consistently showing superior Succ@𝑘 performance by models trained under multi-turn conditions. Intriguingly, these improvements are observable even at the lowest inference budget (𝑘 = 1), suggesting that multi-turn training enhances not only iterative performance but also generalizes well to single-shot scenarios.

Table 1 summarizes three key findings across five models and nine datasets. First, applying 5-turn UFO consistently improves performance over single-turn RL on the same task, confirming its in-domain effectiveness. Second, UFO-trained models generalize reliably to new domains, with consistent gains observed across four broad categories: math, STEM, QA, and general knowledge. Third, math-trained models tend to generalize more strongly than QA-trained ones, possibly due to the more structured and logically consistent nature of mathematical reasoning. These trends hold across two families of open-source models, Qwen2.5 and Llama3.2, spanning from 1B to 7B in scale, suggesting the effectiveness of UFO are robust to both model architecture and size. We note that LLaMA3-1B shows relatively lower base performance compared to official numbers, possibly due to format-following issues.

- Figure 9 | Validation under different verbal feedback prompts. Success rates and action counts remain consistent across all variants, demonstrating UFO’s robustness to various prompts.

These trends suggest that by enabling models to explore alternative reasoning paths and revise prior failures based on sparse feedback, UFO provides a principled path toward robust multi-turn and cross-task generalization.

###### 4.2.2. Multi-turn Setting Enables LRMs to Revise From Feedback

The multi-turn setting enables agents to engage repeatedly with each prompt (up to 𝑇max turns), thereby constructing richer and more informative interaction trajectories from the same training data. This enhanced utilization of feedback is hypothesized to extract more meaningful learning signals per problem, potentially improving solution quality and accelerating convergence, especially in data-limited contexts.

To empirically validate that LRMs can be improved effectively utilizing conversational feedback for revision, we compare 5-turn training scenarios with and without explicit feedback prompts. Results presented in Figure 8(a) support this hypothesis, demonstrating an over 8% peak performance improvement when explicit feedback is provided.

An additional analysis with feedback prompt only in training (Figure 8(b)) reveals performance improvement as well. This suggests that multi-turn training can even intrinsically enhance model reasoning capabilities.

Finally, our robustness analysis in the Figure 9 shows that the effectiveness of this approach is preserved across a range of prompt formulations, underscoring its practical applicability in real-world scenarios.

constant reward linear decay reward exponential decay reward

- Figure 10 | Comparison of reward shaping strategies. While constant, linear decay, and exponential decay schedules achieve similar success rates (left), exponential decay consistently leads to fewer actions per episode (right), indicating more efficient problem solving with less external supervision.

- 4.2.3. Reward Shaping Encourages Efficient Problem Solving

We investigate how different reward schedules influence the agent’s learning behavior, particularly in encouraging early success versus allowing extended exploration. All schedules define a reward 𝑟(𝑛) based on the turn index 𝑛 when the first correct answer is produced, with 𝑛 ∈ {1, . . . ,𝑇max}.

We define and evaluate three distinct reward schedules. Following the formulas proposed in Section 3.4, we compare three approaches: (1) Exponential Decay: 𝑟exp(𝑛) = 𝛾𝑛 (with 𝛾 = 0.5), (2) Linear Decay: 𝑟lin(𝑛) = max(0,1 − 0.2(𝑛 − 1)), (3) Constant Reward: 𝑟const(𝑛) = 1. All schedules operate for 𝑛 ∈ 1, . . . ,𝑇max. The agent’s objective remains to maximize the expected cumulative reward.

Experimental validation (Figure 10) confirms that exponential reward decay notably reduces the mean number of actions by roughly 10%, without sacrificing overall success rates. This reduction in action count suggests that the exponential decay schedule encourages the model to engage in more profound self-reflection and systematic thinking before generating a response.

Considering the normalized penalty term in our experiment (Equation 10), we count the number of non-repetitive answer for each validation round, as shown in Figure 11. The percentage increases from 80% to over 90%, suggesting that the model performs better in the later stages of training as the model learned to explore and self-reflect.

##### 5. Related Work

Enhancing LLM Reasoning with Test-Time Search and Parameter-Efficient Training. Testtime reasoning frameworks keep model weights frozen yet boost performance: Graph-ofThought (Besta et al., 2023), Reflexion (Shinn et al., 2023), Monte Carlo Tree Self-Refine (Zhang et al., 2024), Self-Refine (Madaan et al., 2023), CRITIC (Gou et al., 2023) and memory-augmented agents such as POEM (Do et al., 2024) and Larimar (Das et al., 2024) rely on search, self-feedback or episodic memory without updating model parameters.

Training-time optimisation methods, in contrast, adjust the policy itself. RLHF (Ouyang et al., 2022; Christiano et al., 2017) and its low-cost variant RLAIF (Lee et al., 2023) align models to preference data; scalable-oversight debate protocols explore alignment with weak judges (Kenton

- et al., 2024). Lightweight objectives such as Direct Preference Optimisation (DPO) (Rafailov et al., 2023), Parameter-Efficient RLHF (PERLHF) (Sidahmed et al., 2024) and Self-Play Fine-Tuning (SPIN) (Chen et al., 2024) further cut roll-out cost, while hierarchical ArCHer (Zhou et al., 2024) tackles long-horizon credit assignment. Benchmarks like UNO Arena (Qin et al., 2024) expose the strengths and weaknesses of both families in stateful, multi-turn settings.

Multiturn training for LLMs. Multiturn training for large language models (LLMs) has been explored across benchmarks, optimization methods, and architectural innovations. Evaluation benchmarks such as LMRL-Gym (Abdulhai et al., 2023) and MT-Eval (Kwan et al., 2024) assess LLMs’ abilities to maintain consistency, follow instructions, and exhibit coherent planning across dialogue turns. On the training side, several works extend RLHF to multiturn scenarios by optimizing rewards over full dialog trajectories, including regression-based value estimation (Gao et al., 2025), hierarchical actor-critic methods (Zhou et al., 2024), and direct preference modeling with trajectory normalization (Shi et al., 2024). Further improvements integrate execution feedback in mathematical agents (Xiong et al., 2024), while early efforts focus on optimizing full-dialogue preferences (Shani et al., 2024). Additional frameworks explicitly model long-horizon collaboration through multiturn-aware rewards, as seen in CollabLLM (Wu

- et al., 2025) and the modular self-evolving architecture of RAGEN (Wang et al., 2025). Beyond RL-based approaches, parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods such as Baize (Xu et al., 2023) demonstrate strong multiturn capabilities via LoRA adaptation on self-chat data. A recent survey (Zhang et al., 2025) provides a comprehensive taxonomy covering these approaches, including optimization techniques, memory strategies, and evaluation protocols.

##### 6. Conclusions and Limitations

In this work, we highlight a critical limitation of current single-turn RL training: its tendency to impair multi-turn reasoning by promoting repetitive and shallow responses. To address this, we propose Unary Feedback as Observation (UFO), a simple yet effective method that integrates minimal feedback into existing RL pipelines. By explicitly incorporating prior interaction history, UFO enables models to engage in exploration and self-reflection across multiple attempts, leading to deeper reasoning and improved adaptability. Our experiments show a 14% gain in multi-turn accuracy while preserving single-turn quality. Additionally, we demonstrate that incorporating reward decay and repetitive penalty encourages diverse reasoning, self-correction and more thoughtful response patterns. Our approach is lightweight, generalizable, and easily applicable to existing datasets. A limitation of our work is its primary focus on relatively small models, leaving its generalizability to larger scales for future investigation.

##### A. Extended Background of Reinforcement Learning in LLMs

Reinforcement Learning (RL) enables large language models to improve through interaction and reward feedback. The general RL objective maximizes the expected reward over sampled responses:

𝜃(·|𝑥) [𝑅(𝑥, 𝑦)] , (13)

𝐽(𝜃) = E𝑥∼D, 𝑦∼𝜋

where 𝜋𝜃 is the model policy, 𝑥 is the input prompt, 𝑦 is the generated output, and 𝑅(𝑥, 𝑦) is a scalar reward assessing response quality.

A widely adopted method for RL fine-tuning is Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) (Schulman et al., 2017), which stabilizes training by clipping the likelihood ratio between the new and old policies. The ratio is defined as:

𝜋𝜃(𝑦𝑡 | 𝑥𝑡) 𝜋𝜃old(𝑦𝑡 | 𝑥𝑡)

𝜌𝑡(𝜃) =

The PPO objective minimizes over the clipped surrogate advantage: 𝐽PPO(𝜃) = E𝑡 [min (𝜌𝑡𝐴𝑡, 𝜌ˆ𝑡𝐴𝑡) − 𝛽𝐷KL] , (15)

where 𝜌ˆ𝑡 = clip(𝜌𝑡,1 − 𝜀,1 + 𝜀), and 𝐴𝑡 is the advantage function estimating how much better 𝑦𝑡 is than the baseline under prompt 𝑥𝑡.

For advantage estimation, Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE) (Schulman et al., 2015) is often used:

###### ∑︁∞

𝐴GAE𝑡 (𝛾,𝜆) =

(𝛾𝜆)𝑙𝛿𝑡+𝑙, with 𝛿𝑡 = 𝑟𝑡 + 𝛾𝑉(𝑥𝑡+1) −𝑉(𝑥𝑡), (16)

𝑙=0

where (𝛾, 𝜆) trade off bias and variance.

More recently, DeepSeekMath (Shao et al., 2024) and DeepSeek-R1 (DeepSeek-AI, 2025) adopts Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a RL method that samples a set of outputs {𝑦𝑖}𝐺𝑖=1 for each prompt 𝑥, and optimizes:

𝑖} 𝐽group(𝜃) , (17) with

𝐽GRPO(𝜃) = E𝑥,{𝑦

###### ∑︁𝐺

𝐽group(𝜃) =

where the advantage 𝐴𝑖 is computed using a reward-normalized baseline:

𝑟𝑖 − mean({𝑟𝑗}) std({𝑟𝑗})

. (19)

𝐴𝑖 =

This avoids dependency on value networks and uses rule-based or environment-specific rewards 𝑟𝑖, making it well-suited for reasoning tasks where explicit heuristics can guide learning. GRPO has shown to induce emergent multi-step reasoning behavior across domains.

##### B. Details on the Theoretical Analysis on Repetition Pattern

We provide a detailed proof on how peaked, low-entropy output distribution from RL training (Cui et al., 2025; Yue et al., 2025) can lead to high repetition in model multi-turn behavior.

Preliminaries. Let 𝑞(𝑦 | 𝑥) denote the model’s output distribution given input 𝑥. We introduce the following definitions:

- Definition 1 (Collision Probability). The collision probability of 𝑞(𝑦 | 𝑥) is defined as:

Coll(𝑞) := ∑︁

𝑦

𝑞(𝑦 | 𝑥)2. (20)

This is the probability that two i.i.d. samples from 𝑞 yield the same answer: Pr[𝐴𝑖 = 𝐴𝑗] = Coll(𝑞).

- Definition 2 (Entropy). The Shannon entropy of 𝑞(𝑦 | 𝑥) is:

H(𝑞) := −∑︁

𝑦

𝑞(𝑦 | 𝑥) log𝑞(𝑦 | 𝑥).

Lower entropy corresponds to a more peaked distribution.

- Definition 3 (Expected Number of Duplicate Pairs). Given 𝑘 i.i.d. samples {𝐴1, . . . , 𝐴𝑘} ∼ 𝑞(· | 𝑥), the expected number of duplicate pairs is:

E[DupPairs] =

𝑘 2 · Coll(𝑞).

###### Repetition Under Sequential Sampling.

Proposition 1. Let 𝐴1, . . . , 𝐴𝑘 ∼ 𝑞(· | 𝑥) be sampled sequentially. Since single-turn RL does not guarantee any multi-turn capability, we simplify the assumption that the policy is static and does not update based on prior turns, i.e., the answer at each turn 𝑡 is sampled from the same fixed distribution 𝑞(·|𝑥). The probability of generating a duplicate answer is the collision probability, which is lower-bounded by:

Pr[𝐴𝑖 = 𝐴𝑗] ≥ exp(−H(𝑞)), where H(𝑞) denotes the Shannon entropy of the base distribution 𝑞(· | 𝑥).

Proof. Let 𝑌 ∼ 𝑞(· | 𝑥), and define the collision probability as:

Coll(𝑞) = P[𝐴𝑖 = 𝐴𝑗] = ∑︁

𝑞(𝑦)2 = E𝑌∼𝑞[𝑞(𝑌)].

𝑦

By Jensen’s inequality applied to the concave function log, we have:

logE𝑌 [𝑞(𝑌)] ≥ E𝑌 [log𝑞(𝑌)] = −H(𝑞), which implies:

Coll(𝑞) ≥ exp(−H(𝑞)).

□

Remark 1 (On the Tightness of the Bound). The lower bound Coll(𝑞) ≥ exp(−H(𝑞)) is tight in the following cases:

- • When 𝑞 is uniform on a support of size 𝑛, i.e., 𝑞(𝑦) = 1/𝑛, then H(𝑞) = log 𝑛 and Coll(𝑞) = 1/𝑛, achieving equality.
- • When 𝑞 is a delta distribution (i.e., concentrated on one point), then H(𝑞) = 0 and Coll(𝑞) = 1.

We assume log𝑞(𝑦) is only computed where 𝑞(𝑦) > 0, so the result still holds for distributions with zero-probability points.

A tighter bound can be obtained using the Rényi–Shannon inequality: Coll(𝑞) = 𝑒−H(𝑞)−𝐷KL(𝑞∥𝑢),

where 𝑢 is the uniform distribution on the support of 𝑞. Our stated bound omits the KL divergence for simplicity and interpretability.

This demonstrates that a low-entropy model is mathematically guaranteed to have a higher floor for its repetition rate. Thus, for a static agent that does not learn from feedback, repetition is not an accidental bug but a predictable outcome of the low-entropy distributions created by standard RL.

##### C. Theoretical Analysis on Advantages of Sequential Policies

We model multi-turn reasoning as a finite-horizon Markov Decision Process (MDP), where the state at step 𝑡 is given by

𝑠𝑡 = (𝑞, 𝑎1, 𝑓1, . . . , 𝑎𝑡−1, 𝑓𝑡−1), with input question 𝑞, previous answers 𝑎𝑖, and corresponding feedback 𝑓𝑖.

We represent policies as functions 𝜋𝑡(𝑎 | 𝑠𝑡) that produce an action 𝑎 based on the interaction history 𝑠𝑡. In our setting, the single-turn RL paradigm corresponds to a parallel policy, where the model samples multiple answers independently from a fixed distribution 𝜋(𝑎 | 𝑞) without conditioning on feedback. In contrast, our UFO (Unary Feedback as Observation) operates as a sequential policy, where the action at each step is conditioned on the full history and thus can adapt dynamically.

We formalize the distinction as follows:

- • Parallel policies 𝜋 ∈ Πpar: sample answers i.i.d. from a fixed policy 𝜋(𝑎 | 𝑞), without using feedback.
- • Sequential policies 𝜋 ∈ Πseq: choose actions based on the full state 𝑠𝑡, enabling feedbackdriven refinement.

Every parallel policy is a special case of a sequential policy that ignores interaction history. Formally, for any 𝜋(𝑎 | 𝑞), we can construct 𝜋𝑡(𝑎 | 𝑠𝑡) = 𝜋(𝑎 | 𝑞) for all 𝑡, implying

Πpar ⊆ Πseq. Since Πpar ⊆ Πseq, we immediately have:

max

E[Succ@𝑘] ≥ max

E[Succ@𝑘],

𝜋∈Πseq

𝜋∈Πpar

where Succ@𝑘 denotes the probability of producing a correct answer within 𝑘 attempts. Let 𝑝 denote the success probability under a parallel policy. Then:

Ppar[success in 𝑘 turns] = 1 − (1 − 𝑝)𝑘.

For a sequential policy, let 𝑝𝑡′ be the conditional success probability at step 𝑡, which may depend on the state 𝑠𝑡. The success probability is:

Pseq[success in 𝑘 turns] = 1 −

𝑘

(1 − 𝑝𝑡′), where 𝑝𝑡′ ≥ 𝑝.

𝑡=1

Sequential policies can eliminate previously failed answers by maintaining a rejection set H𝑡 ⊂ A and enforcing:

𝜋𝑡(𝑎 | 𝑠𝑡) = 0 for all 𝑎 ∈ H𝑡.

This behavior approximates sampling without replacement and yields increasing conditional success rates:

𝑝 1 − 𝑡𝑖=−11 𝑝𝑖

𝑝𝑡′ =

> 𝑝.

Therefore, sequential policies such as UFO improve Succ@𝑘 by adaptively avoiding prior failure modes. This formalizes the theoretical advantage of feedback-aware reasoning strategies over static single-turn RL.

##### D. Detailed Evaluation under Multi-round Settings

While all methods perform similarly under 1-round evaluation, models trained with multi-round feedback (UFO) generalize significantly better to longer evaluation horizons.

settings. Each curve represents evaluation success rates under a fixed number of evaluation rounds.

We observe that under 1-round evaluation (top-left), all training strategies achieve similar performance, suggesting that even single-turn training can suffice in this limited setting. However, as evaluation round count increases, the gap between single-round training and multi-round training becomes increasingly significant. In particular, models trained with 10round UFO feedback consistently outperform the others under 6, 8, and 10-round evaluation, demonstrating more stable and generalizable behavior across turns.

These results support our core hypothesis: unary feedback, when used as structured observation during training, enables better long-horizon generalization. In contrast, models trained only with single-round interactions struggle to adapt to multi-turn dynamics, leading to degraded performance as the task horizon increases.

##### E. Prompt Settings

###### E.1. Problem Solving Model Prompt

We adopt a simple and structured prompt format for mathematical problem solving, following prior designs from Yang et al. (2024); Shao et al. (2024), with an extension to support multi-turn interactions. A key element of our prompt is the explicit <think> and <answer> separation, paired with an action budget (Y) and max length (Z). This guides the model to reason step-bystep while planning within a fixed turn horizon, improving controllability and alignment in multi-turn settings. As shown in Box 1, we present the prompt template used during training

and evaluation. Box 1: Model Prompt Template

- F. Model Evaluation Details We present the model used to evaluate answer repetition in Table 2.
- G. Case Analyses

We investigate the impact of multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL) on large language models (LLMs) through a series of curated examples across distinct training stages. These case studies (shown in Boxes 4–7) highlight the evolving dynamics of exploration, convergence, and reasoning quality throughout training.

###### G.1. Case 1: Pre-training Behavior

Before any reinforcement learning, we observe the model’s default multi-turn reasoning behavior in a symbolic pattern-matching task (Box 4). The model is asked to recover a missing variable 𝑋 from a repeating alphabetic value pattern, given partial information and a constraint on the sum of values in a specific word. In Turn 1, the model identifies the relevant positions in the word “numeric” and proposes an initial guess for 𝑋. As feedback indicates the answer is incorrect, the model progressively refines its understanding: it attempts to align characters in the input word with their positions in the pattern and adjusts its value for 𝑋.

Despite making several wrong guesses, the model demonstrates adaptive behavior across turns: it updates its assumptions, introduces new hypotheses, and makes meaningful structural progress (e.g., recognizing the 8-length cycle). However, it ultimately fails to reach the correct solution within the available steps. The case shows that pretrained models already possess

multi-step reflective capabilities and can utilize external feedback to revise their reasoning, even without explicit training for multi-turn alignment. It suggest that reinforcement learning has the potential to further stabilize and guide emergent reasoning process toward convergence.

###### G.2. Case 2: Post Single-turn RL

After reinforcement learning with single-step reward feedback, the model demonstrates drastically different behavior from its pretrained counterpart (Box 5). When tasked with identifying the variable 𝑋 in a cyclic pattern-based word problem, the model immediately commits to a single interpretation. In Turn 1, it attempts a symbolic derivation by aligning the letter values of “numeric” with a fixed periodic pattern, then solving 𝑋 − 3 = −1. However, this derivation mistakenly assumes that the letters in “numeric” correspond to the first 7 elements of the pattern without justifying the mapping. More notably, this exact sequence of logic and answer is repeated identically in Turns 2 through 5.

The case reveals that single-turn RL induces brittle, overconfident behavior: once the model settles on a trajectory during initial inference, it does not reconsider alternative hypotheses or respond meaningfully to corrective feedback. The reward optimization has led to collapse in exploration, as each turn simply replays the same incorrect reasoning with no adaptation. In contrast to the pretraining stage, where the model at least attempts different strategies, this behavior illustrates a major drawback of single-step reward supervision: it teaches the model what to say once, but not how to revise when it’s wrong.

###### G.3. Case 3: Success Adaptation to Feedback Through Multi-turn RL with UFO

This example illustrates the effectiveness of multi-turn reinforcement learning (Box 6). The model is prompted to determine the sum of all positive integers 𝑛 for which 𝑛+18

𝑛 is an integer. In

- Table 3 | Comparison of multi-turn reasoning behaviors across training stages. Case Stage Exploration Convergence Reasoning Quality Failure Mode

- 1 Pre-RL High No Incomplete Early guessing
- 2 Single-turn RL None No Repetitive Overfitting
- 3 Multi-turn RL Moderate Yes Correct aligned
- 4 Multi-turn RL Moderate Yes Incorrect Reasoning drift

Turn 1, it begins by simplifying the expression to 1 + 18𝑛 , and attempts a partial answer without listing all divisors. Upon receiving feedback, the model updates its understanding in Turn 2

by enumerating all positive divisors of 18. By Turn 3, it completes the reasoning process by summing those divisors correctly, arriving at the correct final answer of 39.

The case shows a successful case of multi-turn self-correction, where the model refines its reasoning incrementally in response to feedback. Each turn builds on the previous one: the model first identifies the mathematical form, then retrieves the correct domain knowledge (divisors), and finally executes a complete and valid computation. Unlike single-turn RL, the multi-turn reward structure encourages adaptive reasoning and gradual convergence. The example shows that properly trained multi-turn agents can both reason correctly and update their behavior mid-trajectory in pursuit of a verifiable answer.

###### G.4. Case 4: Reasoning Drift of Multi-turn RL with UFO

We examine a failure trajectory under multi-turn reinforcement learning where the model arrives at the correct final answer through incorrect or misaligned reasoning. As shown in Box 7, the

𝑋 3 −1 7

task is to find the value of 𝑋 such that the matrix

has an inverse consistent with the given

answer “17.” In the initial turn, the model misinterprets the problem structure by assuming that the matrix inverse itself is the scalar 17, and raises a structural objection. In the next turn, it shifts to a more plausible interpretation where 17 is assumed to be the determinant. This leads to the formulation of the correct equation 7𝑋 + 3 = 17, though the value of 𝑋 is still miscalculated at that stage.

By the third turn, the model correctly solves for 𝑋 = 2, but then presents a flawed expression for the inverse matrix, misapplying the standard inversion formula for 2 × 2 matrices. Despite producing the right numerical solution, the trajectory contains conceptual errors related to matrix algebra, including an incorrect cofactor layout. This case highlights a form of reasoning drift: while the final output aligns with the ground truth, the intermediate steps do not constitute a logically valid derivation. Such behavior reveals a potential failure of reward design in multi-turn RL, where correctness of the answer is reinforced even in the absence of faithful reasoning.

To summarize (as in Table 3), multi-turn RL with UFO improves convergence and stabilizes reasoning, but naive reward design can still lead to misalignment between thought and outcome. It highlights the need for evaluation frameworks to go beyond final answer correctness and explicitly assess reasoning integrity throughout the trajectory.

The sum of these values is 1 + 2 + 0 − 1 − 2 − 1 + 1 = 0, which contradicts the given sum of -1. The pattern repeats every 16 letters, and the values repeat as 1,2, 𝑋,0,−1,−2,−1,0,1,2,1,0,−1,−2,−1,0. For the word “numeric", the values

are 1,2, 𝑋,0,−1,−2,−1. The sum of these values is 1 + 2 + 𝑋 + 0 − 1 − 2 − 1 = −1, which simplifies to 𝑋 − 3 = −1, and thus 𝑋 = 2.</think> <answer>2</answer> Reward: 0.0

- You have 9 actions left. Output: <think>Given 𝑛+18

𝑛 is an integer, we have 1 + 18𝑛 as an integer. This means 𝑛 must be a divisor of 18. The positive divisors of 18 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 18. I need to verify which of these values make the expression an integer.</think> <answer>1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18</answer> Reward: 0.0

- You have 8 actions left. Output: <think>Upon reviewing, I realize the divisors of 18 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 18. For each of

these values, 1 + 18𝑛 is indeed an integer. Therefore, the sum of all positive integer values of 𝑛 is 1 + 2 + 3 + 6 + 9 + 18 = 39.</think>

<think>Since the inverse of a matrix is given as 17, and the matrix provided is 2x2, the inverse should be a 2x2 matrix. However, the given inverse of 17 does not align with the structure of a 2x2 matrix. The problem might have a mistake in the provided inverse value or the matrix structure.</think>

<answer>There is an inconsistency in the problem statement. The given inverse of 17 does not match the structure of a 2x2 matrix inverse.</answer> Reward: 0.0

- Turn 2: State: Incorrect. Please think again.

You have 9 actions left. Output:

<think>Given the inverse of the matrix is provided as 17, which does not fit the expected format of a 2x2 matrix inverse (which should be a 2x2 matrix), it seems there might be a misunderstanding. However, since the problem statement specifies the inverse as 17, and considering the structure of the matrix, it implies the inverse is a scalar value.

For a 2x2 matrix

𝑎 𝑏 𝑐 𝑑

, the inverse is 𝑎𝑑1−𝑏𝑐

𝑑 −𝑏 −𝑐 𝑎

. If the inverse is simply 17, it

suggests 𝑎𝑑 − 𝑏𝑐 = 17. Given the matrix

𝑋 3 −1 7

, 𝑎𝑑 − 𝑏𝑐 = 𝑋 · 7 − 3 · (−1) = 7𝑋 + 3. Thus,

7𝑋 + 3 = 17.</think> <answer>7</answer> Reward: 0.0

𝑋 3 −1 7

<think>Given the matrix

, the condition for the inverse to be a scalar 17 is 7𝑋 + 3 = 17. Solving for 𝑋 gives 7𝑋 = 14, thus 𝑋 = 2. The inverse of the matrix should be
