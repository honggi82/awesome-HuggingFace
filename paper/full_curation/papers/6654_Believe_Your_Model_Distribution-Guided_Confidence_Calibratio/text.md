### Abstract

Large Reasoning Models have demonstrated remarkable performance with the advancement of test-time scaling techniques, which enhances prediction accuracy by generating multiple candidate responses and selecting the most reliable answer. While prior work has analyzed that internal model signals like confidence scores can partly indicate response correctness and exhibit a distributional correlation with accuracy, such distributional information has not been fully utilized to guide answer selection. Motivated by this, we propose DistriVoting, which incorporates distributional priors as another signal alongside confidence during voting. Specifically, our method (1) first decomposes the mixed confidence distribution into positive and negative components using Gaussian Mixture Models, (2) then applies a reject filter based on positive/negative samples from them to mitigate overlap between the two distributions. Besides, to further alleviate the overlap from the perspective of distribution itself, we propose SelfStepConf, which uses step-level confidence to dynamically adjust inference process, increasing the separation between the two distributions to improve the reliability of confidences in voting. Experiments across 16 models and 5 benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. Code available at https://github.com/yxizhong/DistriVoting.

### 1 Introduction

The advent of techniques like Chain of Thought [1, 2] and Test-Time Scaling (TTS) [3] has led to remarkable performance improvements in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). However, even though TTS can generate multiple answers or increase token overhead for the same question by increasing test-time computation, enhancing LRMs’ test-time performance remains a critical research direction. The core issue is due to the lack of label or reward signals during the test-time phase, which makes it difficult to evaluate the quality of generated answers and dynamically adjust the generation process. To address this problem, some approaches, like s1 [4], enhance generation by extending the model’s reasoning process without introducing any feedback signals. Other approaches, such as MoB [5] and DORA [6], utilize external reward models to score multiple generated results and aggregate them to obtain the final answer. In contrast, methods like Self-Consistency [7], BoN [8], Self-Certainty [9], and DeepConf [10] has demonstrated that internal information can be effective enough to predict the quality of different answers, without introducing additional models. This category of approach balances effectiveness and efficiency, and its benefits become more pronounced with the improvement of the internal information reliability.

Nevertheless, current work on applying internal information to TTS mainly focuses on designing better ways to obtain internal information [11], such as using sentence-level probabilistic measures

like perplexity and average log-probability, or using distributional information like Kullback-Leibler divergence and entropy. We provide a more detailed introduction of related works in Appendix §A. While these studies have identified a distributional relationship between internal confidence and answer correctness, where correct and incorrect trajectories typically follow distinct statistical distributions, this observation has only been used to assess the reliability of confidence scores. We argue that explicitly incorporating this distributional prior can further improve the performance of confidence-based voting during the answer selection phase.

Motivated by this, we propose DistriVoting, which enhances the reliability of confidence in the final voting through a two-step filtering process. Specifically, the process begins by modeling the confidence distribution as a mixture of two Gaussian components using Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). Subsequently, the distribution is decomposed into positive and negative parts, effectively selecting potential positive answers and filtering out likely incorrect negative answers. However, significant overlap often persists between the two distributions, primarily due to high-confidence incorrect samples and low-confidence correct samples, which may still introduce false positives during the final voting process. To address this issue, we show that the answer voted from negative distribution can be used to reject false positives. Additionally, in order to further alleviate the overlap from a distributional perspective, we propose SelfStepConf, which applies confidence to the generation process of individual trajectories, providing real-time supervision signals to intervene in the inference process.

To evaluate the effectiveness of DistriVoting and SelfStepConf, we conducted experiments using 16 different models include DeepSeek-Series [12] and Qwen3-Series with thinking and non-thinking modes [13], on 5 reasoning benchmarks include HMMT2025, BRUMO2025 [14], GPQA-D [15] and AIME [16]. The results show that our proposed DistriVoting consistently demonstrates performance gains across different models and benchmarks. Furthermore, SelfStepConf increases the separation between the positive and negative distributions, further boosting these improvements.

### 2 Preliminaries

#### 2.1 Confidence of Trajectory

Prior work shows that LLM’s token distributions Pi(j) can reveal uncertainty and trajectory quality. Following DeepConf [10], we compute confidence via token negative log-probabilities to assess quality during and after inference. For a single trajectory containing N tokens output by the model, we define the trajectory confidence as:

k

1 NG × k i∈G

log Pi(j), (1)

Ctraj = −

j=1

where NG,k ∈ N+ and P ∈ RN×N

v. Here, G represents the subset of tokens among the N generated tokens that are used to compute the final trajectory-level confidence, which typically corresponds to the last tail step containing the answer. NG denotes the number of tokens in G, and k denotes the number of top-k probabilities from the token logits that participate in computing token-level confidence.

#### 2.2 Distribution of Confidence

Following the setting of TTS, we perform multiple repeated sampling for all questions within a single benchmark to form a original distribution. Inspired by previous work on confidence distribution [9], we further model it as two normal distributions, where the positive distribution N(µpos,σpos2 ) with a higher mean µpos, and the negative distribution N(µneg,σneg2 ) with a lower mean µneg:

Xpos ∼ N(µpos,σpos2 ), Xneg ∼ N(µneg,σneg2 ). (2)

#### 2.3 Distributions Distance and Voting Accuracy

The primary role of SelfStepConf (SSC) in voting is to amplify the separation between the distributions of positive and negative predictions. We formally prove in Theorem 2.1 (proof provided in Appendix §B) that this enhanced distribution distance directly improves voting accuracy.

when µ1 ̸= µ2, R(µ1,µ2) is strictly monotonically increasing with respect to δ = µ1 − µ2.

- Theorem 2.2. Under the conditions of Theorem 2.1, let {wi}ni=1 be non-negative weights of all n samples, and consider X0 ∼ f(x) is the correct answer and Xk ∼ g(x) (k = 1,...,m,m ≤ n − 1) are m incorrect answers, all mutually independent. The weighted voting accuracy:

has a lower bound that increases with δ = µ1 − µ2.

Furthermore, §5.2 experimentally validates how SelfStepConf achieves superior voting performance through effective distribution separation.

- 3 Methodology

#### 3.1 Overview

Follow the sequence of inference and voting, we first propose SelfStepConf (SSC), a method that dynamically adjusts confidence during reasoning. It monitors step-wise confidence in real-time and triggers self-reflection when confidence declines significantly. After generation, we filter candidate trajectories involved in the final voting via two stages: GMM Filter and Reject Filter, and use HierVoting as the basic voting method for the entire voting process.

#### 3.2 SelfStepConf

Reflection Trigger. Based on the trajectory-level confidence calculation formula in Equation 1, we monitor the confidence of each step in real-time during the inference process. First, for the generated

i-th token, we calculate the token confidence as:

1 k

Ctoken−i = −

k

log Pi(j). (5)

j=1

Following each step, we utilize the formula to compute the m-th reasoning step confidence, the Gm is defined as:

Gm = {ti|index(tms −1) < i ≤ index(tms )},m ∈ N, (6)

where tms represents the m-th step token in the trajectory. Therefore, the current step confidence is expressed as:

k

1 NG

log Pi(j). (7)

After computing the reasoning step confidence, we evaluate its relative change compared to the dynamically adaptive confidence threshold τconf:

∆conf =

##### , m ≥ 1. (8)

m

τconf

If ∆conf < δ, where δ is a control parameter, the system triggers self-reflection due to poor step quality (without updating τconf). Otherwise, τconf is updated via Exponential Moving Average (EMA) using CG

. Furthermore, in real practice, to maintain generation stability, reflection only activates during confidence decline, preventing excessive intervention that could disrupt the reasoning flow. Overall, the self-reflection trigger condition is:

m

IR = I[(∆conf < δ) ∧ (CG

Reflection Injection. To perform reflection, we first define a reflection information token list Tr = [t1r,t2r,...,tN

significantly decreases, we inject reflection information by forcibly swapping the highest-probability token’s probability with that of the corresponding reflection token, and sample with the temperature as 0 for Nr times:

#### 3.3 Distribution Voting

GMM Modeling. After inference, for each question’s Budget trajectories V, we compute trajectorylevel confidence scores C via Equation 1, then predict their distribution using GMM.

Specifically, building on the confidence distributions in §2.2, we model the unlabeled trajectory samples using GMM, approximating their bimodal distribution (positive and negative reasoning paths) with two Gaussian components:

p(x) = π1N(x|µ1,σ12) + π2N(x|µ2,σ22), (12)

where π1,π2 are mixing weights satisfying π1 + π2 = 1 and π1,π2 > 0, and each component N(x|µi,σi2) for i ∈ {1,2} follows a normal distribution:

(x − µi)2 2σi2

The mixture distribution form as follow, where µ1,µ2 and σ12,σ22 are the means and variances of the two distributions:

p(x) =π1

GMM Filter. To assign correctness categories, we apply the mean-based mapping Φ(·) that associates the higher-mean component to the positive distribution and the lower-mean component to the negative distribution:

(µi),σi2 , Xneg ∼ N arg min

(µi),σi2 . (15)

Xpos ∼ N arg max

i

i

After modeling the two distributions, we obtain the potentially correct trajectories Vpos and potentially incorrect trajectories Vneg, along with their confidence sets Cpos and Cneg. We initially form the candidate voting pool using Vpos:

##### Vpos = {Vtraj | Vtraj ∈ N(µpos,σpos2 )}, Vneg = {Vtraj | Vtraj ∈ N(µneg,σneg2 )}. (16)

Reject Filter. Although the GMM initially separates the positive and negative distributions, there is often overlap between them. To address this issue, we aim to use Vneg to further eliminate false positive samples from the candidate voting pool. Specifically, we first aim to select the most likely incorrect negative answers by using the negative values of Cneg as weights in the voting process:

Aneg = fvote(Vneg,−Cneg), (17)

where fvote can be any voting methods. To prevent low-quality filtering, we further propose HierVoting as fHierV detailed in the next part. We show that all voting methods benefit from the reject-filtering setup, while using HierVoting significantly stronger performance as analyzed in §G.1.

Afterward, we further filter the candidate voting pool based on this negative answer when Apos ̸= Aneg (note that there is a one-to-many relationship between correct and incorrect answers), to prevent eliminating the true positive answer:

Vˆpos = {Vtraj | Vtraj ∈ N(ˆµpos,σˆpos2 )}, (18) where N(ˆµpos,σˆpos2 ) is obtained using the filtered trajectories Φ(GMM(CAtraj̸=Aneg)). After applying the negative answer reject filter, we use the final positive pool Vˆpos to vote for the final answer:

Afinal = fHierV(Vˆpos,Cˆpos). (19)

Hierarchical Voting. In the basic voting process, we input a set of trajectories V and their confidences C. Considering that the ratio of correct to incorrect answers varies across different confidence intervals, we adopt a hierarchical voting approach in voting. First, we divide the confidences into NC sub-intervals:

Ci = [cmin + (i − 1)h,cmin + ih], i ∈ [1,NC], (20) where cmin = min(C) and h = max(C)N−min(C)

. Then perform fWMaj within each interval to select an interval answer:

C

}). (21) Finally, we perform weighted majority voting on multiple interval answers to select the voting answer:

Asub = fWMaj({Vtraj,Ctraj | inf Ci

< Ctraj ≤ sup

Ci

fHierV(V,C) = fWMaj({Vsubi ,C¯Ai traj=Aisub | Aisub ∈ Asub}), (22) where fWMaj(·) represents the Weighted Majority Voting:

I(Atraj = ans) · Ctraj. (23)

##### fWMaj(V,C) = arg max

ans

traj∈V

In conclusion, by removing true negative and false positive answers through the two filtering processes, we have enhanced the reliability of the confidence in the final voting.

### 4 Experiment

#### 4.1 Experimental Description

In this section, we primarily validate the effectiveness of the proposed voting methods, including DistriVoting and SelfStepConf (SSC). For DistriVoting, we primarily compare its effectiveness with existing test-time scaling voting methods, such as Self-Consistency (SC) [7], BoN [8], MoB [5], Weighted-SC (WSC) [17], and DeepConf (WSC-Top50) [10]. We further evaluate the superiority of the GMM Filter component over the Top50 Filter in this section, while the analysis of Reject Filter and HierVoting is provided in §5.1, §E.4 and §G.1. For SelfStepConf, we focus on its contribution to voting accuracy, while other detailed analysis presented in §5.2, §5.5 and §5.6. Additionally, for the Qwen3 model series, we employ thinking mode by default, with asterisk-marked models* denoting non-thinking variants. All experiments use temperature t = 0.6 unless otherwise noted, except for non-thinking models which use t = 0.7. Detailed descriptions provided in Appendix §C, pseudo code provided in Appendix §D, parameter analysis provided in Appendix §E, step split methods and reflection information provided in Appendix §F.

#### 4.2 Main Results

In our main experiments, we primarily evaluated two models: DeepSeek-R1-8B and Qwen3-32B, testing their voting performance on five mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Beyond comparing with other TTS methods, including SC, BoN, MoB, and WSC, we demonstrate the effectiveness improvements brought by DistriVoting and SelfStepConf.

Specifically, as shown in Table 1, we first compared the adaptive GMM Filter (WSC/DIS-GMM) with the fixed top-threshold filter (WSC/DIS-Top50, with the rationale for Top50 selection analyzed in §5.3). The results show that across the two models, GMM improved performance from 74.75% and 75.22% to 76.64% and 75.79%, respectively, compared to Top50 using WSC, and improved performance from 76.32% and 75.79% to 76.95% and 75.99% using DIS.

Building upon the filtering mechanism, we then evaluated our proposed DistriVoting against the naive weighted voting method WSC. The results demonstrate that DistriVoting consistently delivers

superior performance compared to WSC across all three models under both Top50 filter and GMM Filter settings, showcasing the effectiveness of incorporating distribution-aware voting mechanisms.

To strengthen confidence distributions discrimination, we investigated the impact of SSC by comparing GMM and GMM* variants. The results show that SSC provides substantial and consistent performance gains across all models for both WSC and DistriVoting approaches, validating the benefit of enhanced confidence differentiation in the generation process (see §5.2 for detailed analysis).

#### 4.3 Ablation Study

GMM. DistriVoting is based on the premise that the confidences of correct and incorrect trajectories follow a bimodal normal distribution, leveraging GMM to partition confidences for predicting trajectory correctness. Essentially, GMM is treated as a distribution-based clustering method, which can be replaced by other clustering approaches to achieve the same objective. Here, we compare clustering methods including K-Means and MeanShift, analyzing their impact on final DistriVoting results, prediction accuracy, and computational efficiency. Additionally, we evaluate the quality of confidences within the positive intervals obtained by different clustering methods using metrics:

AUROC, Acc = |V|1 traj∈V I(Atraj = Agt) and WAcc = |V|1 traj∈V I(Atraj = Agt) · Ctraj (Weighted Acc).

- Table 2: Ablation of clustering methods using DeepSeek-R1-8B, sampling 128 trajectories/query via DistriVoting (64 repeats). Complete results provided in Table 12 of §G.2.

As shown in Table 2, GMM achieves 1.78× the efficiency of K-Means and 5.49× that of MeanShift, while significantly outperforming both in trajectory correctness prediction accuracy, leading to superior voting performance. The confidences quality evaluation metrics further highlight GMM’s outstanding performance, demonstrating its suitability for prediction tasks involving bimodal normal distributions. Despite this, clustering methods like K-Means and MeanShift still offer clear advantages over a fixed Top50 filter.

Budget. Budget is a crucial parameter for voting methods. We evaluate six budget settings (8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256) for our proposed SSC and DistriVoting approaches. As shown in Table 3, SSC consistently outperforms BasicInference across all budgets, confirming that SSC improves voting by enhancing distribution separation. Additionally, the adaptive GMM Filter also consistently surpasses fixed Top50 filtering in both WSC and DistriVoting settings.

Furthermore, DistriVoting shows significant advantages over conventional methods when Budget ≥ 16, while maintaining comparable performance at smaller budgets. This stems from its reliance on distributional information: small sample sizes yield noisy distributions, while larger samples provide more reliable discriminative information, allowing DistriVoting to fully utilize its distributional advantages.

### 5 Analysis

#### 5.1 The Effectiveness of DistriVoting

To further analyze the impact of GMM Filter and Reject Filter on voting effectiveness, we calculated Acc and WAcc defined in §4.3 across three stages: (I) Before filter (all samples); (II) After GMM Filter (candidate positive samples); (III) After Reject Filter (final positive samples).

WAcc

As shown in Table 4, both Acc and WAcc increase progressively across the three stages, indicating that GMM Filter (Stage I → II) and Reject Filter (Stage II → III) respectively improve the correct sample ratio in their trajectory pools, thereby boosting the final voting accuracy.

#### 5.2 SSC’s Role in Enhancing Voting Effectiveness

From the experimental results, we observe that SSC significantly enhances voting performance. To analyze the source of this performance gain, we computed the confidence distributions for SelfStepConf and BasicInference. As shown in Figure 2 (Up), the SSC distribution exhibits greater separation than the BasicInference, with less overlap, indicating that SSC amplifies the distance between distributions.

Furthermore, in §2.3, we theoretically prove that increasing the difference between µpos and µneg leads to a higher proportion of correct samples among trajectories after GMM Filter, and this proportional change results in improved final answer accuracy during the voting process.

- As shown in Figure 2 (Down), to illustrate this effect intuitively, we analyzed confidence-sorted trajectories by calculating average correctness rates in both the positive interval (right side, predicted incorrect by GMM Filter, shown in orange) and negative interval (left side, predicted correct by GMM Filter, shown in green). Higher correctness density indicates more reliable voting information. The difference in densities reflects the correctness advantage of the positive interval, with larger differences indicating more effective Reject Filter performance. Specifically, SSC achieves a higher correctness density in the positive interval at high confidence ranks compared to the BasicInference, increasing the density difference from 0.165 to 0.251, thus enhancing voting effectiveness through better distribution separation.

In the main results section, we compare two filter voting methods: GMM and Top-50% (i.e, DeepConf). To analyze the rationality of this setting, we combined the description of top-threshold in DeepConf and tested the optimal partition thresholds under different models and benchmarks.

- As shown in Figure 3, we evaluated WSC-TopK with top-thresholds at 1% intervals, applying each threshold uniformly to all questions in the corresponding benchmark. The results showed optimal thresholds varied significantly across benchmarks (6%, 9%, 36%, 42%, and 96%) and models (see §E.4 and §G.6). Therefore, we uniformly use 50% threshold as the representative baseline for fixedfilter voting methods. In contrast, our proposed DistriVoting can adaptively select optimal trajectories for voting at both benchmark and individual question levels. Moreover, as demonstrated in our supplementary results, this question-level adaptive approach can outperform even the best-performing benchmark-level fixed-threshold voting methods (see Figure 12 in §E.4).

#### 5.4 Interpretation of Gaussian Components in GMM

DistriVoting uses GMM to decompose confidences, selecting trajectories with higher correct probabilities for final voting. This builds on our confidence distribution analysis, where GMM’s Gaussian components correspond to correct and incorrect distributions. Furthermore, we explored the relationship between confidences and answers, treating each answer as a Gaussian distribution.

Specifically, instead of labeling confidence with correctness, we use the trajectory’s answer. As shown in Figure 4, the top 8 frequent answers in HMMT2025 follow normal distributions but overlap significantly. For example, the means of the top 1 and 2 answers differ by only 0.022, making it hard to distinguish answers using confidence alone. Since correctness is more critical, using it directly as the label for clustering avoids mapping confidence to answers and then to correctness, reducing information loss and improving the reliability of final voting.

#### 5.5 SSC’s Impact on Model Sampling Behavior

This section examines SSC’s effect on trajectory-level confidence changes to understand its influence on sampling distribution. First, we calculate the trajectory-level confidence of results generated by SelfStepConf (SSC) and BasicInference. As shown in Figure 5, SSC significantly improves confidence across all benchmarks, generating trajectories with higher correctness probability. And combined with the analysis in §5.2, it can be known that this improvement mainly comes from the correct samples.

Furthermore, Figure 6 illustrates the trend of pass@K performance as the number of samples increases. At K=1, SSC achieves notably higher pass@1 values than the BasicInference. However, as K increases, the pass@K performance of SSC and the BasicInference converges. This pattern aligns with the conclusion from [18] that RL improves sampling efficiency but not reasoning limits. Similarly, SSC, as a depth-oriented test-time scaling approach, improves sampling efficiency without expanding fundamental reasoning limits. Regarding SSC’s improvement in sampling efficiency, Figure 7 shows that the enhancement primarily appears in moderately performing base models, exhibiting an arched growth pattern. For underperforming models with weaker reasoning capabilities, reflection injection is less effective. For high-performing models, the improvement is relatively weaker due to diminishing returns.

#### 5.6 SelfStepConf Effects on Inference Dynamics

During model inference process, SSC monitors step confidence in real-time and intervenes when reflection is triggered, altering the trajectory compared to the BasicInference, particularly in confidence and response length. To assess this impact, we set temperature=0 to ensure SSC’s trajectory aligns with the BasicInference before intervention occurs. We analyzed the similarities and differences

As shown in Figure 8, two reflection triggers occurred (step 21 and 55). Before the first reflection, both models’ trajectories were consistent. However, after reflection, significant differences in confidence and token count emerged. Reflection enhanced subsequent confidence, while BasicInference’s confidence declined. After the second reflection, SSC maintained high confidence, leading to a correct answer, while the BasicInference resulted in an incorrect one.

Regarding token count, SSC matched the BasicInference before reflection, with differences appearing upon reflection. In Figure 8, the BasicInference produced 91 steps with 9,472 tokens (104.1 tokens/step), while SSC generated 86 steps with 7,750 tokens (87.8 tokens/step). Furthermore, as shown in Table 5, SSC generally showed fewer steps and tokens than the BasicInference across benchmarks, indicating that reflection improves trajectory-level confidence without increasing response length. Notably, while SSC doesn’t increase response length, it performs additional checks per token, slightly raising time complexity from O(n) to O(n + k), where k depends on step splitting (§F.2). Using “\n\n” as the delimiter, SSC’s runtime increased by only 2.31% compared to the BasicInference.

### 6 Conclusion

This paper addresses the issue of confidently wrong predictions when using model-inherent confidence for voting in test-time scaling. Specifically, we propose DistriVoting, which leverages the prior information of confidence distribution to optimize the voting process. It uses GMM Filter to remove true negative samples and Reject Filter to eliminate false positive samples from the original sampling distribution. Additionally, HierVoting is employed to compensate for performance deficiencies when filter quality is low. Besides, SelfStepConf (SSC) from the of distribution, dynamically adjusts the model’s inference process, increasing the distance between distributions to further enhance the reliability of distribution information. Detailed experiments and analyses are conducted to qualitatively and quantitatively demonstrate the effectiveness of DistriVoting and SSC.

### Impact Statement

This is propose a confidence-based test-time scaling method that enhances voting accuracy using solely model-internal information, whose goal is to advance the field of Machine Learning. There are many potential societal consequences of our work, none which we feel must be specifically highlighted here.

### A Related Works

Test-Time Scaling (TTS). Current TTS research primarily focuses on increasing the inference depth of single sampling or improving information utilization among multiple sampling results to enhance the accuracy of final answers [19, 20, 21]. The s1 [4] study investigated the scaling relationship between response length and accuracy in single sampling results, using BudgetForcing to specify upper and lower bounds for thinking tokens, or forcibly replacing end tokens with wait tokens to extend inference length. Self-Consistency [7] leverages consistency information among multiple repeated sampling results to select the final consensus answer. Building upon this foundation, works such as MoB [5] and DORA [6] further utilize Reward Models to provide quality assessments for each sampling result, thereby refining the weights among different results and optimizing the voting methods through this weight information. In comparison, while our work similarly leverages weight information among different answers to improve final answer accuracy, we employ model-intrinsic information for self-weighted. Furthermore, we not only utilize this verification information to optimize voting schemes but also leverage it to dynamically adjust the model’s generation process, achieving self-enhancement through self-weighted.

Intrinsic Information of LLMs. The widespread application of RL has enhanced the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, leading to the emergence of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) [22]. An increasing number of studies suggest that intrinsic information generated during the generation process of LRMs can, to some extent, reflect the quality of model responses [23]. This information can be utilized not only in the training process to further extend the application scenarios of RLVR [24, 25], but also in TTS to evaluate the quality of multiple answers and leverage this quality assessment to achieve serial, parallel, and tree-based answer search optimization. Average Log-Probability and Perplexity evaluate model response confidence by utilizing sentence-level probability information [26, 27, 28, 29, 30]. Entropy and Self-Certainty [9] further employ distribution-level confidence to assess relative confidence among multiple answers. Although existing work has identified that different confidence calculation methods correspond to distinct quality distribution characteristics, they have not further applied the discriminative information between these distributions to voting mechanisms. We leverage the confidence distribution differences between correct and incorrect answers, employing adaptive filtering and reject sampling to improve the reliability of answers participating in final voting, thereby enhancing voting results.

- • µ1 = µ + δ, µ2 = µ are the means with δ > 0,
- • σ12, σ22 are the variances.

The voting accuracy is bounded below by:

Pvote(δ) ≥ P(Sf > Sg) =: Plower(δ), (31) where P(Sf > Sg) serves as a lower bound for Pvote(δ). The difference distribution is:

Sf − Sg ∼ N δWf + µ2(Wf − Wg),σ12Wf(2) + σ22Wg(2) . (32) Expressed via the standard normal Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF):

where ϕ(·) > 0 is the standard normal PDF (positive everywhere), Wf > 0 (non-trivial weights), and the denominator is positive (σ1,σ2 > 0).

Since Pvote(δ) ≥ Plower(δ) and the lower bound is strictly increasing in δ, the voting accuracy Pvote(δ) must also be strictly increasing in δ.

### C Experiment Description

#### C.1 Baseline and Competitors

The core contributions of our proposed method lie in three key aspects: confidence computation, dynamic adjustment mechanisms within single question inference, and distribution-based voting methods. For confidence computation, we adopt the negative average log-probability from SelfCertainty [9] and the token group concept from DeepConf [10], selecting the tail group containing the answer to calculate the overall trajectory confidence. However, our approach differs in that we do not use fixed window groups, but instead partition semantic steps according to reasoning blocks. The experimental section analyzes the advantages of this approach (Figure 13 in §F.2). Regarding the single inference process adjustment mechanism, since dynamic adjustment of reasoning processes at test-time has not been extensively explored, we primarily compare against basic inference methods. For the voting method, we use weighted majority voting as our baseline and compare with other test-time scaling voting approaches, including Self-Consistency (SC) [7], BoN [8], MoB (using confidence as the reward) [5], Weighted-SC (WSC) [17], DeepConf (WSC-Top50) [10].

#### C.2 Implementation Details

Regarding the implementation details of our methods, for trajectory step segmentation, we select “\n\n” as the reasoning block signal, which has been thoroughly studied in StepPruner [31]. Regarding reflection information, we simply used “wait” as the predefined reflection token and supplemented more comparative experiments in Table 6 of §F.1. For the EMA update parameter α controlling τconf in SelfStepConf and the parameter δ controlling reflection trigger conditions, we set both to 0.8. For NC in base voting, we simply set it to 10. These parameters are analyzed accordingly in the Appendix §E. For the device used in the experiment, unless otherwise specified, all experiments were conducted on NVIDIA H-Series GPU. In addition, for the parameter top-p in the inference process, we set it to 0.95.

Prompt Template. In our experiments, we used two different prompt templates to handle different benchmark. For GPQA-D, the format of the prompt is:

{

}

"role": "user", "content": "Return your final response within \\boxed{} and only

include the letter choice (A, B, C, or D) as your final response. {Question}"

For HMMT2025, AIME2024, AIME2025, and BRUMO2025, the specific format is:

{

"role": "user", "content": "{Question}\nPlease reason step by step,

and put your final answer within \\boxed{}." }

Evaluation. For the main experimental setup, we employ the Qwen3 [13] series models ranging from 0.6B to 32B (operating in thinking mode by defaul, and models marked with * use non-thinking mode), along with DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B models [12] (referred to as DeepSeek-R1-8B and DeepSeek-R1-7B, respectively). In addition, we also used the Qwen2.5-Math-7B [32] and Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct [33] in analysis. We evaluate our approach on five mathematical reasoning benchmarks: HMMT2025 [14], GPQA-D [15], AIME2024 [16], AIME2025 [16], and BRUMO2025 [14]. Following baseline configurations, we set the context length to 32k for Qwen3 series models and 64k for DeepSeek-Distill models. Unless otherwise specified, the temperature is configured as 0.7 for Qwen3 non-thinking mode and 0.6 for all other settings. All pass@1 metrics are computed by averaging results across 64 independent evaluations, while voting experiments use a Budget of 128 trajectories by default. In the experiments, all average results are computed using weighted averages based on the number of questions in each benchmark.

### E Parameters Analysis

According to the implementation logic of SelfStepConf and DistriVoting, the main parameters include: (1) top-k for computing token-level confidence; (2) EMA factor α for dynamically updating confidence threshold in SSC; (3) δ for determining reflection trigger conditions in SSC; (4) the number of intervals NC specified in HierVoting.

#### E.1 Analysis of top-k

First, for top-k, we follow the setting from prior work [10], setting k = 20. This choice is empirically justified by the probability distribution characteristics of modern LLMs. Through analysis of randomly sampled inference traces, we observe that at over 99.7% of token positions, the top-20 tokens account for more than 99% of the cumulative probability mass. This demonstrates that K = 20 effectively captures nearly all meaningful probability signal while maintaining computational efficiency. Additionally, this setting aligns well with practical deployment considerations, as standard inference engines like vLLM typically provide at most 20 log-probabilities by default.

#### E.2 Analysis of α

For α, δ, and NC, we primarily analyze their robustness through experiments. The EMA factor α mainly determines the proportion of the previous threshold when updating the threshold, correspond-

ing to the case where IR = 0 in Equation 10. A larger α gives more weight to the confidence from previous steps, resulting in a smoother threshold curve, while a smaller α makes the threshold tend

toward the step confidence Gm.

- provided in Table 19 of §G.12.

We analyzed the sensitivity of the parameter α by examining both Analysis Metrics (Steps Count, Tokens Count, Confidence, and Time) and Accuracy Metrics (Avg Pass@1, WSC-GMM* Accuracy, and DIS-GMM* Accuracy). Note that there are some discrepancies between the Analysis Metrics and the results in Table 5 of §5.6, as we used a temperature of 0.6 and repeated the process 64 times here (NVIDIA H-Series GPU), whereas the main text used a temperature of 0 (NVIDIA A-Series

GPU). As shown in Figure 9 (a) and (c), within the range of α from 0.1 to 0.9, all metrics except time show minimal variation. This indicates that our proposed SelfStepConf and DistriVoting are not sensitive to the EMA update factor of the confidence threshold. Therefore, considering both efficiency and effectiveness, we opted for a setting of α = 0.8.

Additionally, to visually demonstrate the impact of different α values on SelfStepConf, we plotted the change in confidence threshold over steps for the same query under different α values in Figure 9 (b) (with temperature set to 0 and sample 1 trajectory for Question 7 of HMMT2025). It is evident that as α increases, the variation in the confidence threshold decreases, which aligns with the role of α as described in Equation 10.

#### E.3 Analysis of δ

For δ in Equation 9, it determines how much the current step confidence needs to drop relative to the confidence threshold to trigger reflection. This value affects the strictness of the confidence checking mechanism: a larger δ means that even a slight drop in step confidence relative to the threshold will trigger reflection, while a smaller δ shows greater tolerance for drops in step confidence.

- Figure 10: Parameter sensitivity analysis of δ under different metrics. Using DeepSeek-R1-8B to generate 128 trajectories per query, with experiments repeated 64 times. Complete results are

- provided in Table 20 of §G.13.

Similar to the analysis of parameter α, we examined the sensitivity of parameter δ from the perspectives of Analysis Metrics (Steps Count, Tokens Count, Confidence, and Time) and Accuracy Metrics (Avg Pass@1, WSC-GMM* Accuracy, and DIS-GMM* Accuracy), maintaining the same experimental setup. As shown in Figure 10 (a) and (c), parameter δ exhibits similar sensitivity to α, being insensitive to all metrics except time. Therefore, considering both efficiency and effectiveness, we chose δ = 0.8.

Additionally, the role of δ primarily involves controlling the strictness of reflection triggers in Equation 9. To visually demonstrate its impact on SelfStepConf, we calculated the average number of reflection triggers for all questions in HMMT2025 under different δ settings with temperature set to 0. As shown in Figure 10 (b), the number of reflection triggers increases with δ, indicating that δ is directly proportional to the strictness of the reflection trigger conditions. Furthermore, when δ ≤ 0.7,

the number of reflections drops to zero, causing SelfStepConf to degrade to BasicInference. Thus, from the perspective of reflection trigger conditions, δ = 0.8 is also an appropriate choice.

#### E.3.1 Analysis of α × δ

To further analyze the sensitivity of parameters α and δ in SelfStepConf, we conducted a joint analysis using HMMT2025. Specifically, we set the range of α and β to [0.1,0.9], and then calculated the Analysis Metrics (Steps Count, Tokens Count, Confidence, Reflections Count, and Time) and Accuracy Metrics (Avg Pass@1, WSC-GMM* Accuracy, and DIS-GMM* Accuracy) under the group parameters. As shown in Figure 11, it can be observed that under joint analysis, α = 0.8 and δ = 0.8 remain a preferable choice. Furthermore, when δ is small (< 0.2), it can be observed that the various metrics show almost no change, which further proves that SelfStepConf degrades to Basic Inference in this case.

#### E.4 Analysis of NC

Finally, NC in Equation 20 determines how many sub-intervals the confidence should be divided into during the BaseVoting process for Weighted Majority Voting. We evaluated three BaseVoting-based

methods (DIS-Top50, DIS-GMM, and DIS-GMM*) across NC ∈ [1,20], as shown in Figure 12. The results show that except for DIS-Top50 at NC = 1 which exhibits notably different performance, all methods achieve similar results across different values of NC. This indicates that BaseVoting demonstrates considerable robustness for NC > 1. For simplicity, we adopt the default setting of NC = 10 throughout all experiments.

Based on our experimental results, we observe an interesting phenomenon: stratified voting strategies (NC > 1) significantly improve performance only for the DIS-Top50 method, while showing limited effectiveness for GMM Filter approaches. The fundamental reason why GMM Filter is insensitive to stratification operations lies in its powerful quality filtering capability, which has already addressed the problems that stratification strategies attempt to solve. Specifically, GMM Filter uses probabilistic modeling to precisely identify high-quality trajectories, resulting in relatively uniform quality across different confidence intervals after filtering, thereby reducing the necessity for stratification. Unlike DIS-Top50’s simple threshold selection, GMM Filter has already removed most low-quality trajectories globally, making the voting results of remaining samples inherently stable. When trajectory quality has already reached a high level through GMM Filter, further stratification operations provide limited performance gains, explaining why GMM and GMM* maintain relatively stable performance across different NC settings. This observation is further supported by the trend shown in Figure 12 (b), where the performance difference between Nc = 1 and NC = 2 decreases as the top-threshold increases. This finding demonstrates that high-quality pre-filtering mechanisms can significantly reduce dependence on complex voting strategies, which is consistent with the ablation analysis of HierVoting discussed in Table 10 of §G.1.

### F Supplementary experiment

#### F.1 Reflection Information Ablation Study

For SelfStepConf’s operation of injecting additional reflection information at steps where confidence significantly decreases during inference, we primarily use “wait” as the critical fork token to trigger model reflection for simplicity. Additionally, we experimented with other reflection information as shown in Table 6. It can be observed that under the condition of not introducing additional parameters (i.e., without using other models for judgment or learning how to reflect through training), the performance differences across different tokens are not significant when only injecting reflection prompt tokens.

#### F.2 Step Split Ablation Study

A key challenge in implementing SelfStepConf lies in how to reasonably partition steps. Previous works have proposed partitioning by fixed-size windows [34, 10, 6], by “\n” [35], and by complete Thought-Action-Observation cycles in multi-turn dialogues [36]. Unlike these approaches, we need to dynamically adjust steps during test-time inference, thus we believe using “\n\n” to maintain paragraph-level logical integrity is more appropriate in reasoning tasks.

Additionally, we refer to [37] and believe that high entropy tokens in trajectories may be potential fork tokens, thus conducting step checks at these critical positions provides decisive assistance for the overall reasoning direction. Specifically, we adopt the high entropy threshold of 0.672 from [37], performing confidence checks when token entropy exceeds this value. However, during experiments, we found that directly splitting steps only according to high-entropy tokens results in excessively short step lengths. Therefore, we further set a lower bound of 200 for step length. As shown in Table 7 and Figure 13, Similar to the evaluation methods of §E.2 and §E.3, we compared six indicators such

as Avg Pass@1, Steps Count, Tokens Count, Confidence, Reflections Count and Time. Compared with fixed-size window-level (256/512/1024/2048), dynamic sentence-level (“\n”), and entropy-level approaches (HET, High-Entropy Token), paragraph-level partitioning (“\n\n”) is more suitable for SSC. Furthermore, in terms of efficiency, it can be seen that the influence of different step splits on inference time is relatively obvious. Combining steps count, tokens count, confidence, and reflection count, it can be known that this influence is mainly related to the number of times reflection is triggered, and is also affected by the other several indicators.

More Main Results. In addition to the main experiments in the text involving the DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen3-32B models (Table 1 in §4.2), We also tested the voting performance of SelfStepConf and DistriVoting on Qwen3 models ranging from Qwen3-0.6B to Qwen3-32B, including both thinking mode and nonthinking mode. The results shown in Table 8 and Table 9 are consistent with the analysis in the main text, showing that DistriVoting consistently outperforms WSCVoting under different filter strategies. Moreover, both DistriVoting and WSCVoting demonstrate that the GMM Filter significantly outperforms the Top50 filter. The SelfStepConf generation method, indicated by *, further amplifies this improvement. Notably, the voting performance improvement of SSC on models with weaker and stronger reasoning abilities is not as pronounced, this observation aligns with our pass@1 analysis results of Figure 7 in §5.5 of the main text.

Methods Ablation. We conducted detailed ablation experiments on the key components of the proposed methods: SelfStepConf and DistriVoting (GMM Filter + Reject Filter + HierVoting). As shown in Table 10 and Table 11, SelfStepConf is marked with ✗ for basic inference and ✓ for SSC inference. GMM Filter is marked with ✓ for using the GMM Filter and ✗ for using the naive top50 filter, and “–” indicates no filtering, using all trajectories for voting. Reject Filter is marked with ✗ and ✓ for performing and not performing the Reject Filter, respectively. HierVoting is marked with ✗ and ✓ for using Weighted-SC Voting and HierVoting, respectively. From the results, it is evident that SSC inference consistently outperforms basic inference under any setting, indicating that SSC provides a consistent improvement in voting performance. Additionally, among the three components of DistriVoting, the GMM Filter is crucial in affecting performance, as its presence significantly impacts voting results. The benefit of the Reject Filter on voting performance relies on the foundation of the GMM Filter, meaning that only after a good distribution split can the positive and negative results of the distribution be reliably rejected. In contrast, HierVoting improves voting performance even without the GMM Filter, but its impact is not significant with the addition of the GMM Filter and Reject Filter. This is primarily due to the diminishing marginal returns of performance enhancement, where the advantages of more complex voting strategies are mainly evident on a weaker filtering basis, aligning with our analysis of Figure 14 in §E.4.

- Table 10: Complete ablation experiments on the method components in the main experiments using DeepSeek-R1-8B, sampling 128 trajectories/query (64 repeats). The naive version of the GMM Filter is the Top50 Filter, the naive version of HierVoting is Weighted-SC, and the naive version of the Reject Filter is no filtering. – indicates no filtering at all, i.e., directly using all trajectories for voting.

#### G.2 Detailed Ablation Results of Distribution Splitting Methods

For the average ablation experiment results of different distribution splitting methods on five benchmarks in Table 2 of §4.3, we supplement the detailed results for each benchmark here. As shown in Table 12, Acc and WAcc are defined in §4.3, and the closer the AUROC is to 1, the higher the quality of confidence in the positive interval after distribution splitting. Voting Acc is calculated based on DistriVoting, Predict Acc represents the binary classification accuracy of the distribution splitting method, and Predict Time indicates the average runtime of different clustering methods per trajectory.

#### G.5 Detailed Results on the Impact of SelfStepConf on Confidence Distribution

For the impact of SelfStepConf on confidence distribution under DeepSeek-R1-8B shown in Figure 2 of §5.2 in the main text, we provide additional quantitative experiments under more models (Qwen38B, Qwen3-14B, Qwen3-14B-NonThinking, and Qwen3-32B) here. As shown in Table 15, we primarily use two evaluation metrics: AUROC and WAcc. It can be observed that under different models, the confidence quality (AUROC) of SSC’s generated results is higher compared to the BasicInference, and the average correct confidence (WAcc) is also higher.

#### G.6 Top-Threshold Sensitivity Analysis on More Models and Benchmarks

For the results shown in Figure 3 of §5.3 in the main text, which display the optimal benchmark-level top-threshold applicable under different benchmarks using Qwen3-8B, we present here from both benchmark and model perspectives. As shown in Figure 14, we separately demonstrate that the applicable top-threshold varies for different models on the same benchmark, and also varies for different benchmarks on the same model. This further supports the rationale for using top50 to represent the fixed threshold filter method.

#### G.7 Detailed Clustering Results of Answer Categories via GMM

In §5.4 (Figure 4) of the main text, we presented aggregated visualization results of the GMM distributions, where the number of answer types was used to determine the optimal number of GMM components. Here, we provide separate visualizations for the frequency distributions of selected top-frequent answers. As shown in Figure 15, each answer’s distribution approximately follows a Gaussian pattern, which aligns consistently with our theoretical analysis in main text.

#### G.8 Additional Results on the Impact of SelfStepConf at the Trajectory-Level

For the visualization results in Figure 5 of §5.5 in the main text, which show the impact of SelfStepConf on trajectory-level confidence compared to the BasicInference using DeepSeek-R1-8B, we additionally provide results for Qwen3-8B, Qwen3-14B, Qwen3-14B-NonThinking, and Qwen3-32B here. As shown in Figure 16, it can be intuitively observed that our analysis conclusions remain consistent across different models.
