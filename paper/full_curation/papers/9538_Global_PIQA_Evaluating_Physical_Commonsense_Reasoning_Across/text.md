### Abstract

To date, there exist almost no culturally-specific evaluation benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) that cover a large number of languages and cultures. In this paper, we present Global PIQA, a participatory commonsense reasoning benchmark for over 100 languages, constructed by hand by over 350 researchers from over 65 countries around the world. The 141 language varieties in Global PIQA cover five continents, 19 language families, and 24 writing systems. In the non-parallel split of Global PIQA, over 50% of examples reference local foods, customs, traditions, or other culturally-specific elements. In the parallel split, we translate more “culturally agnostic” commonsense reasoning questions into 131 language varieties, for direct cross-lingual comparisons. In both splits, all examples have been verified by native speakers of the languages. We find that state-of-the-art LLMs perform well on Global PIQA in aggregate, but they exhibit weaker performance in lower-resource languages (e.g. up to a 68% accuracy gap between languages in the parallel split). Global PIQA highlights that in many languages and cultures, everyday knowledge remains an area for improvement in LLMs, alongside more widely-discussed capabilities such as complex reasoning and expert knowledge. Beyond its uses for LLM evaluation, Global PIQA provides a glimpse into the wide diversity of cultures in which human language is embedded.

### 1 Introduction

Nearly all prominent multilingual benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) translate existing English datasets into other languages (e.g. XNLI, XCOPA, Belebele, XStoryCloze, MGSM, and Global MMLU; Conneau et al., 2018; Ponti et al., 2020; Bandarkar et al., 2024; Lin et al., 2022; Shi et al., 2023; Singh et al., 2025). As a result, the vast majority of the world’s languages lack culturally-specific evaluation datasets that cover local customs, traditions, and everyday life for speakers of the language. The culturally-specific datasets that do exist generally still rely heavily on translation or are limited to a relatively small number of languages (e.g. Global MMLU and BLEnD; Singh et al., 2025; Myung et al., 2024).

This lack of culturally-specific datasets is particularly relevant in the domain of commonsense reasoning, where LLMs are evaluated for physical, social, and world knowledge that is broadly known by the majority of people in a community. Commonsense reasoning capabilities have long been a desirable property of LLM-based systems, evaluated through popular benchmarks such as HellaSwag (Zellers et al., 2019) and PIQA (Bisk et al., 2020). Because commonsense reasoning

focuses on everyday physical and social activities, and it has its basis in community knowledge, it differs greatly across languages and cultures. Unfortunately, culturally-specific commonsense reasoning evaluation datasets do not exist for the vast majority of the world’s languages.

To fill this gap, we present Global PIQA1, a culturally-specific commonsense reasoning benchmark created by native speakers of over 100 language varieties across the globe. In contrast to previous multilingual benchmarks, examples in the non-parallel split of Global PIQA are written directly in each language, largely by NLP researchers who speak the language, involving very little or no translation. Authors were given flexibility to determine the topics and domains for their examples, in order to develop “target-language original prompts” (Kreutzer et al., 2025) that are appropriate for each linguistic and cultural context. The resulting non-parallel split covers 136 language varieties. For more direct comparisons across languages, we also release a parallel split of more “culturally agnostic” commonsense reasoning questions translated into 131 language varieties.

We then evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on Global PIQA. We find that proprietary models perform well in aggregate, with some models achieving over 90% accuracy averaged across languages. However, Global PIQA highlights disparities between high- and low-resource languages, along with uneven region coverage. For example, on the parallel split, the best-performing open-weight model evaluated has over 25% lower average scores for Sub-Saharan African languages than for European or East Asian languages. Even the best-performing proprietary LLM has a 68% accuracy gap between the best- and worst-performing languages (§H.3). We hope that Global PIQA will enable researchers to measure and ultimately close this multilingual performance gap both across languages and between open and proprietary models. More broadly, Global PIQA provides a glimpse into a wide variety of global cultures, through commonsense examples describing everyday life in over 100 languages.

### 2 Background and Related Work

Multilingual evaluation datasets. Most multilingual evaluations for standard LLM tasks (e.g. question answering and mathematical reasoning) are the product of translation from English (e.g. EU20, mArenaHard, Okapi, MMLU-ProX, and MGSM; Thellmann et al., 2024; Dang et al., 2024; Lai et al., 2023; Xuan et al., 2025; Shi et al., 2023). In some cases, the translations are automatic

without any human verification, which can lead to unnatural examples and low-quality datasets due to artifacts from machine translation (Singh et al., 2025). In other cases, benchmarks are professionally translated or use human-verified translations (e.g. Belebele, MMMLU, IrokoBench, Global MMLU, and XQuAD; Bandarkar et al., 2024; OpenAI, 2024; Adelani et al., 2025; Singh et al., 2025; Artetxe et al., 2020). These benchmarks are less likely to suffer from quality issues related to machine translation, but they are still not necessarily culturally relevant for the target languages. Benchmarks translated from English have been found to propagate Anglocentric perspectives and values (Singh et al., 2025; Kreutzer et al., 2025).

Culturally-specific evaluation. Culturally-specific evaluation is critical for designing models that align with values other than those from higher-resourced countries for LLM research (Nigatu

- et al., 2024). Culturally-specific benchmarks have been constructed for a variety of languages (e.g. INCLUDE, TyDi QA, CulturalBench, MultiLoKo, DOSA, and BLEnD; Romanou et al., 2025; Clark et al., 2020; Chiu et al., 2025; Hupkes and Bogoychev, 2025; Seth et al., 2024; Myung et al., 2024), and datasets such as MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2021) have been localized to other languages (e.g. CMMLU, KMMLU, ArabicMMLU, TurkishMMLU, and IndoMMLU; Li et al., 2024; Son et al., 2025; Koto et al., 2024; Yüksel et al., 2024; Koto et al., 2023). Results from these localized benchmarks correlate more strongly with human judgments of model quality than results from translated or non-localized benchmarks (Wu et al., 2025). However, these datasets often focus on challenging knowledge questions in localized topics, rather than commonsense cultural knowledge which is often widely known in the community but not documented on the web.

Physical Interaction: Question Answering (PIQA). To define the task format and scope for Global PIQA, we take inspiration from English PIQA (Bisk et al., 2020). PIQA aims to measure physical commonsense reasoning, which we note in §1 is likely to vary substantially across languages and cultures. In Global PIQA, we consider commonsense reasoning more broadly, defined as a broad collection of related tasks relying on knowledge of object properties, affordances (types of actions an agent can perform with an object; Gibson, 1979; Jones et al., 2022), physical and temporal relations, and basic world knowledge. Each example in PIQA consists of a “goal” (or prompt) and two possible solutions, one correct and one incorrect (e.g. Figure 1). Prompt-solution pairs can consist of sentence beginnings and completions, questions and answers, or goals (e.g. making specific food dishes) and solutions. Even five years after its initial release, PIQA is still being used in evaluations, e.g. reported in technical reports for releases such as Gemma 3 (Team Gemma et al., 2025) and Llama 3 (Meta AI, 2024). Despite its broad usage as a benchmark for English, PIQA has not been translated or broadly adapted as a multilingual benchmark, much less extended to massively multilingual and culturally-specific settings.2

### 3 Global PIQA: Non-Parallel Split

Thus, we construct Global PIQA, a commonsense reasoning benchmark for 141 language varieties. The first split of Global PIQA, covering 136 language varieties, is non-parallel (i.e. not translated across languages) to allow authors to write culturally-specific examples for their languages. Following the PIQA dataset (Bisk et al., 2020; §2), each example consists of a prompt and two candidate solutions, one correct and one incorrect. Each example can be used to evaluate either a pretrainedonly model (Figure 1, top) or an instruction-tuned model (Figure 1, bottom). Determining the correct solution is designed to require some form of commonsense reasoning, such as physical reasoning, temporal reasoning, cultural knowledge, or basic world knowledge.

#### 3.1 Organizing a Global and Participatory Benchmark

For the non-parallel split of Global PIQA, authors contributed datasets following the task format described above (details in §3.2). Authors provided their datasets with short dataset descriptions,3 and all authors of included datasets were offered co-authorship on this paper. To date, the Global PIQA project has involved over 350 contributors across over 65 countries and over 180 university or

company affiliations. Our authors range from early career undergraduate researchers to professors at major global universities. In this setup, researchers benefit from co-authorship on a large benchmark paper, and they have both the domain expertise and motivation to write high quality examples. Participation is entirely voluntary. This contrasts with benchmarks where external annotators are paid to create datasets, with little incentive to create high quality examples (Fort et al., 2011a,b). We recruited a diverse group of researchers through large online communities, low-resource NLP grassroots organizations, social media, and personal connections (§C).

#### 3.2 Dataset Construction Methods

We asked authors to construct at least 100 examples in their language, all manually checked by a native speaker of the language. Translated examples directly from the English PIQA dataset are not included in the non-parallel split of Global PIQA. Authors were asked to construct examples (prompt, solution0, solution1) where (1) the correct solution relates to physical properties of one or more objects, and (2) an average person who speaks the language natively would likely know the answer. Because we found that many submissions did not cover physical commonsense in a strict sense, we expanded our scope to cover commonsense reasoning more generally, as detailed in §D.2.

We also encouraged authors to include culturally-specific examples that might not be easily translatable into English, or that might require regional or cultural commonsense knowledge. Specifically, in the guidelines sent to all authors, we encouraged examples based on “local foods, places, everyday objects, customs, traditions, religions, literature, folklore, or art forms”. We asked authors to vary the length of their examples (e.g. to include some examples greater than 25 words long), make the two candidate solutions as similar as possible (while still having one be unambiguously correct and the other unambiguously incorrect), and avoid having the incorrect solution be “so absurd that it is extremely obvious”. Full guidelines sent to authors are on our GitHub.

Aside from these guidelines, authors were provided substantial flexibility in creating the datasets for their languages. This is a benefit of having researchers construct their own datasets; as native speakers and researchers working in each language, they themselves are experts who can ensure the quality of their respective datasets. This flexibility also allowed each author to construct a dataset that was culturally specific to their language and dialect, in the way that they believed was best. Method descriptions for individual languages are in §I, and we highly encourage readers to explore these individual dataset descriptions.

Diverse methods. Indeed, authors used a wide variety of methods to brainstorm and construct examples. A total of 146 groups of authors contributed datasets. We encouraged authors to manually write examples, and 128 out of 146 groups drafted their examples entirely manually (i.e. without the help of LLMs). Some authors (29 groups) wrote examples motivated by content on websites or other resources in their language, such as recipe blogs, DIY pages, question forums, or how-to books. Many groups brainstormed examples based on specific topic categories, such as food, home, clothing, transportation, hobbies, or religion. The vast majority of groups (141 out of 146 groups) explicitly reported making their datasets at least partially culturally-specific, covering local foods, clothing, traditions, everyday life, and/or customs.

In line with the task description (§3.2), all groups reported writing examples based on everyday topics. For example, one group spent one month adapting naturally-occurring sentences spoken by family and friends, and another group read examples aloud to their parents and grandparents to verify “colloquial [language] usage, cultural appropriateness, and everyday realism”. All groups had their examples written or checked by at least one native speaker, and most groups (92 groups) had multiple native speakers check each example. Brief method details for all individual groups are in §I.

A small number of groups (5 out of 146 groups) used LLMs to generate topic ideas, but not to generate examples themselves. Another 16 groups used LLMs to initially generate examples, before filtering, editing, and manual verification by the authors. In these cases, LLMs had to be prompted carefully so as not to generate easy and generic examples; for example, one group reported that “our preliminary attempts involved using state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate question candidates. However, we found these outputs to be consistently inadequate” (for Tamil). Another group reported that LLMs “produced poor quality samples; no such items were included in the final dataset” (for Azerbaijani). The 16 groups that used LLMs to generate initial examples

reported needing to filter the resulting datasets heavily for quality (e.g. keeping only 14.6% and 22.0% of examples in the two independent groups who reported the proportions of examples kept).

#### 3.3 Compiling the Non-Parallel Dataset

The next step in constructing the Global PIQA non-parallel split was to run quality checks and compile the dataset for each language. For each language, we standardized column names, added unique example IDs, and normalized language codes to use ISO 639-3 individual language codes (e.g. cmn for Mandarin Chinese, c.f. macrolanguage codes; language code details in §B) with ISO 15924 script codes (e.g. latn for Latin script). In cases where a dataset used a specific dialect within an individual language code, we appended an optional four-letter region code; for example, the Global PIQA language code for Brazilian Portuguese is por_latn_braz. Finally, to inspect the data more easily, we generated initial machine translations into English using Gemini 2.5 Pro (details in §D.1).

Additional manual annotation and cultural specificity. Based on the LLM-generated English translations, we dropped examples that did not fit the task description (e.g. a small number of abstract logic puzzles). We also dropped examples that seemed trivially easy based on the English translations. Finally, we annotated examples as “culturally-specific” if they met at least one of three criteria: (1) the example uses words that do not translate well into English, e.g. specific food dishes or local brands, (2) the example describes specific holidays, folklore, traditions, or sayings, or (3) the correct solution likely varies by region, e.g. involving local norms, laws, or customs. Annotation details, along with motivations for our operationalization of cultural specificity, are in §D.2. For contributions where all examples were non-culturally-specific, or where dropping trivial and off-task examples led to a dataset with under 100 examples in the language, we worked with those authors to reach the 100 example threshold and to increase their number of culturally-specific examples if possible.

Subsampling. After cleaning but before any subsampling, the full dataset consists of 29.1K examples covering 136 language codes (§B). Because this full dataset is highly skewed across languages and often overwhelmed by non-culturally-specific examples, we subsampled to an official non-parallel split of exactly 100 examples per language to use for model evaluations. First, where possible (i.e. when this did not reduce our sample size to less than 100 examples for a given language), we filtered out examples where the two candidate solutions differed in length by more than 25 bytes, when normalized to English byte equivalents (Arnett et al., 2024). We also filtered out examples whose non-stopword tokens overlapped by more than 50% with another example in the dataset, using the per-language tokenizers from Goldfish (Chang et al., 2024).4 This aimed to ensure diversity across topics for the official Global PIQA dataset for each language. Subsampling details are in §D.4.

Then, we sampled 100 examples from this filtered subset for each language. We sampled culturallyspecific examples before non-culturally specific examples (as annotated above), and within each of these categories, we first sampled examples that did not use any LLMs in the creation process. In the resulting official non-parallel split, 59.9% of examples are annotated as culturally-specific, and only

- 4.1% of examples are written with the help of LLMs.

Secondary validation and English translations. Finally, to make examples readable by a broader audience, authors corrected the machine translations into English for the official non-parallel split, for 126 of the 136 language varieties. Authors followed the same translation correction guidelines as for the parallel split later in §4 (details in §D.5). As part of this process, authors were also asked to verify the correctness of each example in the original language. As a result, 7.3% of examples were modified in the source language during this final stage of correction, and 48.7% of the machine translations to English were modified. Lastly, because not all authors are native speakers of English, we used Gemini

- 3.0 Flash with manual validation by a native English speaker to correct any grammatical errors in the English translations, working with the dataset authors to ensure that the English translations remained semantically accurate (§D.5). We note that the vast majority of our authors are not professional translators, and thus the English translations are intended only to convey the general meaning of each example to a broader audience.

4Due to lack of available resources for many low-resource languages in our dataset, we define stopword tokens as tokens that appear in at least 25% of examples in the Global PIQA dataset for that language. Dataset filtering details are in §D.4.

#### 3.4 Official Non-Parallel Split

The resulting official non-parallel split of Global PIQA contains 100 examples per language for 136 language codes. When excluding region codes, the Global PIQA non-parallel split covers 124 language-script combinations and 113 unique ISO 639-3 language codes. These languages cover five continents, 18 language families, and 24 scripts (writing systems). The full list of languages is in §B. All examples have been manually validated by at least one native speaker of the respective language, and 97.8% of examples have been validated multiple times by native speakers; 92.6% of examples include manually-verified English translations. Even outside of LLM evaluation, we have anecdotally found that simply reading the English translations in the Global PIQA non-parallel split can provide a unique glimpse into a wide variety of traditions and cultures across the globe.

### 4 Global PIQA: Parallel Split

The non-parallel split of Global PIQA enables culturally-specific evaluations of LLMs in 136 language varieties. However, its non-parallel nature makes direct comparisons between languages difficult. Thus, we also construct a parallel split of Global PIQA, consisting of 103 “culturally agnostic” commonsense reasoning questions translated from English into 131 language varieties.

Example construction. Examples in the parallel split differ from the non-parallel split in that (1) they have four candidate solutions per prompt instead of two, and (2) they only consist of prompts and solutions that are questions and answers, with no examples formatted as sentence beginnings with candidate completions. To construct these examples, two native English speakers wrote 109 examples in English, with inspiration drawn from the original English PIQA (Bisk et al., 2020), EWoK (Ivanova et al., 2025), TRAM (Wang and Zhao, 2024), PROST (Aroca-Ouellette et al., 2021), Glenberg and Robertson (2000), HellaSwag (Zellers et al., 2019), and difficult examples from the non-parallel split of Global PIQA. Examples were written to require knowledge of object properties or affordances, object interactions, spatial or temporal reasoning, or basic counting (§E.1). The authors wrote all examples to be as “culturally agnostic” as possible, with minimal references to local dishes, customs, or traditions, to facilitate translation to a large number of languages. After review by two native English speakers, each example was machine translated into all 131 language varieties in the parallel split. Machine translations used either Gemini 2.5 Pro or Gemini 3.0 Flash (§E.2).

Translation corrections. The machine translations were then sent for correction to authors who were native speakers of each language. Translation correction guidelines are in §E.3, and each translation was corrected or verified by at least one native speaker of the target language. The mean character edit distance per example between the corrected and uncorrected translations was 24.9 characters (mean 12.9% of characters), with all edit distances and uncorrected machine translations available in the example supplements on Hugging Face. The languages with the highest mean character edit distances were Ekpeye (273.7 characters per example), Idoma (209.0 characters per example), and Urhobo (131.6 characters per example). Common issues that arose during translation correction are described in §E.2 and §E.3.

All authors were also asked to verify that each question and correct solution remained valid after translation. In many cases, native speakers were able to use common loan words or approximate translations to substitute for words without direct equivalents in their language. For example, in Urhobo, loan words for blue and yellow were “borrowed and Urhobonized”, as our Urhobo-speaking author described that “there are only three colors in the Urhobo language: red, white, and black”; this is not uncommon crosslinguistically (Kay and Maffi, 2013). Still, six examples were dropped from all languages after translation correction, either due to ambiguities in the original English example, or due to ambiguities arising from translation. For instance, in an example involving melting vs. dissolving sugar, we found that the verb for “dissolve” is the same as “melt” in at least 25 of the language varieties in the parallel split. Additionally, two examples related to cardinal directions had to be dropped only from Ekpeye because, as reported by our Ekpeye-speaking author, “there is no term to designate north, south, east, or west” in Ekpeye; this is also not uncommon crosslinguistically (Brown, 1983). These cases highlight the limitations of translated benchmarks, particularly for languages that are typologically distinct from and less culturally similar to most high-resource languages.

#### 4.1 Official parallel split

In total, the official parallel split of Global PIQA contains 103 human-verified parallel examples in 131 language varieties (except for Ekpeye, which has 101 examples). The full list of languages is in §B. Although the parallel split of Global PIQA does not facilitate culturally-specific evaluations, it enables more direct comparisons across languages. The parallel and non-parallel splits of Global PIQA together allow researchers to determine the extent to which commonsense reasoning performance differences across languages are due to (1) differences in models’ “culturally agnostic” commonsense reasoning capabilities in different languages, as evaluated in the parallel split, vs. (2) differences in how well the models perform in different cultural contexts, as evaluated in the non-parallel split.

5 Results for State-of-the-Art LLMs

Finally, we evaluate existing LLMs on Global PIQA. We find that proprietary models perform well when averaged across languages, but performance is substantially worse for some languages and regions. Dense open-weight models generally under-perform relative to closed models.

#### 5.1 Evaluation Format

We evaluate models in one of two formats: cloze or generation (Figure 1). All examples in Global PIQA are amenable to either format, and both formats are implemented in the LM Evaluation Harness (Gao et al., 2024; §G). For most use cases, we recommend the generation format, as the cloze format can be difficult without few-shot prompting for pretrained-only models (Brown et al., 2020).

Cloze-style evaluation: For models that are not tuned to follow instructions (i.e. pretrained-only or “base” models), we compute the log-probability from the LLM for each candidate solution given the prompt, normalized by the length of each solution in bytes: log(P(solution | prompt))/ len(solution). If the correct solution has a higher normalized probability than the incorrect solution(s), then we mark the model correct for that example.

Generation-style evaluation: For models that are tuned to follow instructions (e.g. the vast majority of proprietary models, and instruction-tuned and RL-tuned open models), we prompt the LLM with the prompt template in Figure 1. For the parallel split, we modify the prompt template slightly (§G), to accommodate the four-choice question-answer task format. We sample up to 2048 tokens, then

#### 5.2 Models

We evaluate a wide range of open, open-weight, and proprietary (closed) systems on Global PIQA. As noted in §5.1, we focus on instruction-tuned models (including proprietary models), which we evaluate with the generation-style format. Evaluated models include Apertus (Hernández-Cano

- et al., 2025), Qwen 2.5, 3, and 3.5 (Yang et al., 2024; Qwen Team, 2025), Llama 3.1 and 3.2 (Meta AI, 2024), Gemma 2, 3, and 4 (Team Gemma et al., 2024, 2025; Google DeepMind, 2025), Aya, Command A, and Command R (Dang et al., 2024; Cohere Team et al., 2025), GPT-5.4 (Regular, Mini, and Nano; OpenAI, 2026), Claude Sonnet 4.6 (Anthropic, 2026), Gemini 3.1 (Pro and Flash-Lite; Google DeepMind, 2026c,b), and Gemini 3 Flash (Google DeepMind, 2026a). We also evaluate a wide variety of open-weight models that are trained to focus on one language or region. The full list of models we evaluate is in §G.1. Proprietary systems are evaluated with thinking on, with a 1024-token thinking budget for Gemini and Claude, and “medium” thinking for GPT-5.4 (details in §G). The open-weight models range from 300M to 120B parameters.

#### 5.3 Results

In Figure 2, we show the top-performing open-weight models’ performance on the non-parallel split of Global PIQA by model size; a similar plot for the parallel split is in §H.1. Following Michaelov et al. (2026), we do not directly compare open models and proprietary LLM-based systems. Instead, closed systems (GPT-5.4, Claude, and Gemini) are plotted as horizontal dashed lines as a “skyline” for model performance; some of these systems achieve over 90% accuracy on both the parallel and non-parallel splits of Global PIQA. For open-weight models, we observe a steady performance increase as parameter counts increase, but performance begins to plateau around 30-40B parameters,

and there remains a gap between the top closed systems and the strongest open-weight models that we evaluate. The best-performing open-weight model we evaluate is Gemma 4 31B, with a mean accuracy of 82.4% on the parallel split and 84.9% on the non-parallel split. We hope that Global PIQA will help direct progress towards closing this gap between smaller open-weight models and proprietary systems.

Disparaties across regions and languages. Global PIQA also highlights languages and regions for which state-of-the-art LLMs under-perform. In Figure 3, we report mean performance on the parallel split for the top open-weight models and closed systems, grouped by region and by resource level. Regions are defined in §H.2, and resource levels are taken from Joshi et al. (2020). Similar figures for the non-parallel split are in §H.2. In the best-performing open-weight model (Gemma 4 31B), mean accuracy for European languages is 88.1%, but mean accuracy for Sub-Saharan African languages is only 60.5%. When grouping languages by resource level, Gemma 4 31B achieves 91.0% mean accuracy for high-resource languages compared to only 75.0% for low-resource languages. Similar trends are observed for other models evaluated, including the proprietary LLMs (Figure 3).

Furthermore, for the parallel and non-parallel splits respectively, there are 6 and 12 languages for which the best-performing LLM achieves less than 90% accuracy, even when including closed LLM systems. There are 4 and 8 languages for which the best models achieve less than 80% accuracy: Ekpeye (33% parallel / 65% non-parallel), Idoma (37% / 75%), Isoko (60% / 96%), Urhobo (66% / 89%), Lingala (92% / 72%), Plateau Malagasy (95% / 76%), Zarma (– / 79%), Sundanese (– / 70%), Meitei Manipuri (– / 63%), and Burushaski (– / 59%). Lingala and Plateau Malagasy show the largest drop in performance from parallel to non-parallel for the best-performing models (20% and 19% accuracy drops), indicating weaker cultural knowledge relative to linguistic ability. However, we note qualitatively that the non-parallel split varies substantially in difficulty across languages due to its non-parallel nature. All results per language and model are reported in our GitHub.

### 6 Discussion and Conclusion

In this paper, we have presented Global PIQA, a commonsense reasoning benchmark covering 141 language varieties. Unlike previous benchmarks, Global PIQA is a participatory benchmark, constructed by hand by over 350 researchers across over 65 countries. This enables the construction of a culturally-specific non-parallel split, where over 50% of examples reference local foods, clothing, customs, traditions, or other culturally-specific elements. For direct comparisons between languages, we also construct a parallel split of more “culturally agnostic” commonsense reasoning questions translated into over 100 languages. We find that proprietary LLMs perform well overall on Global PIQA, but there are still significant disparities between some languages and regions. Open-weight models generally have lower accuracies than proprietary models, and Global PIQA allows researchers to clearly quantify the gap between open and proprietary models in multilingual settings. Notably, Global PIQA measures commonsense knowledge, demonstrating that in many languages, areas for improvement can be as simple as everyday reasoning. This contrasts with complex logical reasoning and expert knowledge, which have been the focus of many recent LLM benchmarks.

Limitations. Of course, Global PIQA has several limitations. First, the sample size per language is only 100 examples; in the future, we hope that our participatory approach to benchmark construction will facilitate the construction of larger datasets. Second, we note that while Global PIQA contains culturally-specific examples, these examples are snapshots specific to our authors and researchers, not necessarily representative of entire cultures. Cultural stereotypes may be present in the dataset, although all examples are constructed by native speakers of the languages. For language coverage, we emphasize that while we have aimed to include as many languages as possible in Global PIQA, more languages is not necessarily better when constructing multilingual benchmarks; researchers should work with communities themselves to determine if and how they want their languages included. In Global PIQA, we have sought to work together with native speakers as authors, giving authors flexibility and ownership over how they construct their datasets.

Finally, although large closed systems perform quite well on Global PIQA when averaging across languages, we believe that Global PIQA remains useful as a benchmark. Global PIQA distinguishes between the performance of closed systems and open models, between different open models, and even between different closed systems (Figure 3). It also measures variation in performance across

languages within each of these models. This variation across languages and models indicates that Global PIQA remains unsaturated as a benchmark (Akhtar et al., 2026). We see Global PIQA as particularly useful for tracking performance of frontier systems for low-resource languages, and for tracking the development of smaller, open models for under-studied languages.

Conclusion. We close by noting that the scale of participation in this project has far exceeded the organizers’ expectations. The result is a manually-curated, culturally-specific evaluation dataset for over 100 languages. Furthermore, the parallel split of Global PIQA provides a multi-parallel evaluation dataset with unprecedented language coverage. We are excited to continue developing community-led open-source multilingual evaluations, and we believe that this is an extremely promising avenue for addressing the critical lack of benchmarks for the vast majority of the world’s languages.

Global PIQA would not be possible without the efforts of all of the authors. We intentionally do not list authors by contributed language. This is to preserve privacy, as some authors would prefer not to be contacted by unaffiliated projects that require expertise in their language. Correspondence should be sent to the lead authors (tachang@ucsd.edu and catherine@eleuther.ai) or to mrl.benchmarks@gmail.com. Global PIQA is a community effort, and it does not necessarily reflect the opinions or views of the authors’ affiliated organizations.

### B Language Codes and Included Languages

We normalize all language codes in Global PIQA to use ISO 639-3 individual language codes (three letters), ISO 15924 script codes (four letters), and an optional custom four-letter region code for dialects within an individual language code. For example, the code for Mexican Spanish is spa_latn_mexi, and the code for Peninsular Spanish (as spoken in Spain) is spa_latn_spai. In the non-parallel split, when the language code was unclear for an individual dataset based on the description from the authors, we worked with authors to identify the specific ISO 639-3 and ISO 15924 codes that would best reflect their dataset. For clarity, we note:

- • ISO 639-3 macrolanguage codes are often used in other work for some languages. We use individual language codes for more precision, and here, we show mappings from commonly-used macrolanguage codes to the ISO 639-3 individual codes used in Global PIQA:

◦ Mandarin Chinese: zho → cmn Cantonese Chinese: zho → yue Standard Estonian: est → ekk Norwegian Bokmål: nor → nob Norwegian Nynorsk: nor → nno Nepali: nep → npi Iranian Persian (Farsi): fas → pes Swahili (Kiswahili): swa → swh Northern Uzbek: uzb → uzn Standard Malay: msa → zsm Central Kurdish: kur → ckb Odia: ori → ory North Azerbaijani: aze → azj Classical Sanskrit: san → cls Plateau Malagasy: mlg → plt

- • Dialects of Arabic are often separate individual ISO 639-3 language codes. In Global PIQA, we have:

◦ Iraqi Arabic (Gelet): acm_arab Yemeni Arabic: acq_arab Tunisian Arabic: aeb_arab Gulf Arabic: afb_arab Levantine Arabic (Jordan): apc_arab_jord Levantine Arabic (Lebanon): apc_arab_leba Levantine Arabic (Palestine): apc_arab_pale Levantine Arabic (Syria): apc_arab_syri Modern Standard Arabic: arb_arab Algerian Arabic: arq_arab Najdi (Saudi) Arabic: ars_arab Moroccan Arabic (Darija): ary_arab Egyptian Arabic: arz_arab

- • A Filipino dataset (language code fil) separate from the Tagalog dataset (language code tgl) is not included, despite the two being considered separate individual language codes in ISO 639-3. This is because native speakers of Tagalog often refer to the two languages interchangeably; Filipino is the standardized national language of the Philippines, but it draws influence primarily from Tagalog.

Using these language, script, and optional region codes, Global PIQA contains 141 unique language varieties. This includes 129 unique ISO language-script combinations, 118 unique ISO 639-3 language codes, and 24 unique ISO 15924 script codes. Language counts per region and language family are shown in Table 2. Language families use the top-level families from Glottolog (Hammarström et al., 2023); we note that the Indo-European family is a large family including the Armenic, Balto-Slavic, Celtic, Germanic, Indo-Aryan, and Iranian sub-families (among others), with languages ranging from English and Spanish to Hindi and Persian (Farsi). Regions are defined in §H.2. We also note that all of the languages in the North America and South America regions in Global PIQA are originally

European languages that are now spoken in the Americas; if possible, we hope to include more indigenous languages of the Americas in future benchmarks.

The full list of languages in Global PIQA is in Table 1.

- Table 1: List of all languages in Global PIQA. This includes the language code, language name, language family, resource level (Joshi et al., 2020), percentage of culturally-specific items in the non-parallel split, and the best LLM accuracy for both the parallel and non-parallel splits.

### C Organizing a Global Participatory Benchmark

As described briefly in §3.1, Global PIQA was organized as a global participatory benchmark involving over 350 contributors across over 65 countries and over 180 university or company affiliations. All contributors were offered authorship on this paper, and the vast majority chose to be authors. Here, we detail additional procedures that made the collaboration successful.

- • Recruiting. We recruited a diverse group of contributors through large online communities, low-resource NLP community organizations, social media, and personal connections. For example, we publicized the Global PIQA task through announcements on the Eleuther AI Discord, the LINGUIST List, Masakhane, X/Twitter, BlueSky, and LinkedIn. We also identified NLP researchers with experience constructing benchmarks and language models for specific languages or language families, and we contacted them directly to broaden our reach. We maintained a spreadsheet of interested volunteers (with contact information and languages spoken) to keep volunteers informed throughout the process. We encouraged existing contributors to recruit additional volunteers for languages that were missing from the benchmark.
- • Early feedback. We allowed authors to send initial examples and preliminary versions of their datasets for feedback well before the dataset submission deadline. This contrasts with traditional shared tasks at NLP conferences, where participants have minimal interaction with the organizers prior to submitting. Furthermore, we held FAQ meetings one month before the deadline, held at multiple times to accommodate different time zones, and we maintained a consistently-updated set of slides with instructions and FAQs for creating the Global PIQA datasets.
- • Data quantity. We required a minimum of 100 examples per language for each submitted dataset. We found that this quantity was doable so as not to discourage researchers from participating, but large enough to ensure that researchers put significant thought into creating their datasets.
- • Timeline and acceptances. The shared task was publicly announced in late June 2025, with a submission deadline of September 15, 2025. This allowed almost three months to recruit contributors and for groups to develop datasets. The timeline was short enough, however, that no momentum was lost. After the dataset submission deadline, we also continued to allow submissions for languages and dialects that were still missing from the benchmark. We individually reached out to volunteers who had signed up for specific missing languages, and in many cases, we were able to work out later deadlines that were more amenable to those authors. In cases where an initial dataset submission did not meet quality checks (§3.3), the dataset was not simply rejected; instead, we worked with the authors to make improvements for the dataset to be accepted. Datasets were only rejected if those contributors did not respond to feedback or decided not to make required changes (e.g. adding examples to meet the minimum 100 examples per language, after filtering out examples as in §D.1 and §D.2), or due to other non-technical organizational challenges (§D.3).

### D Non-Parallel Split: Cleaning, Compilation, and Sampling Details

#### D.1 Non-Parallel Split: Cleaning and Compilation

- As described in §3, authors contributed datasets to the Global PIQA non-parallel split for their own language(s). At minimum, each dataset contributed to Global PIQA contained a prompt, solution0, solution1, and label column. For each dataset, we first removed exact duplicate examples and invalid examples where the two solutions were identical. We normalized column names, moved supplemental information (e.g. “topic” fields or other columns added by individual groups) to a supplement column, and we converted all text fields to use UTF-8 text encoding. For transparency, we annotated any examples that used LLMs to initially generate the example; this is a relatively small number of examples (9.6% before subsampling, then 4.1% in the official non-parallel split), and all examples are human validated before inclusion in Global PIQA (see method descriptions in §I). For several datasets, we found that sentence completion examples (i.e. examples where the prompt is an incomplete sentence, and the candidate solutions complete the sentence) contained prompts ending with ellipses (“...”) or underscores (“___”, i.e. fill-in-the-blank). We removed these ending ellipses and underscores, as the completions are concatenated directly onto the prompts when fed into LLMs in the cloze evaluation setup (§G).

As a preliminary check, we used Google Translate to translate a random subset of ∼20 examples per dataset, to identify any egregious errors (e.g. all examples far too easy, not following the task

|Translate the following into English. If there are any words that do not translate well into English (e.g. specific foods or cultural items), keep only those words in the original language.

|---|

- Figure 4: Translation prompt template used to translate examples in the non-parallel split into English with Gemini 2.5 Pro. In the non-parallel split, 92.6% of English translations were human-corrected; uncorrected machine translations are marked in the dataset with [machine_translated].

format, or large numbers of repetitive examples). Based on this preliminary check, if any datasets were clearly not culturally specific (see annotation guidelines in §D.2), we asked the dataset authors for optional revisions to add more culturally-specific examples. In these cases, we asked authors to modify or add examples to include words that are unlikely to translate well into other languages, such as food words, words for types of clothing, or local brand names.

After this initial cleaning and revision, to better inspect the data, we used Gemini 2.5 Pro to translate each “[prompt] [solution]” into English for all datasets. Here, in the non-parallel split, we translated the prompts and solutions together because some prompts consisted of incomplete sentences that only made sense in the context of a corresponding solution, and some solutions only made sense in the context of the corresponding prompt. We accessed Gemini 2.5 Pro through Google’s Gemini API using a paid API key, and the translation prompt used is in Figure 4. As described in §D.5, we later corrected the English machine translations with the help of native speakers; however, we used the uncorrected machine translations for initial annotations and spot-checks of the datasets (e.g. cultural specificity annotations in §D.2). For example, for many languages we were able to spot-check labels in the datasets for “easy” examples that had clear correct answers. From this cursory verification, we found two datasets with systematic errors where the annotated labels were often flipped to be incorrect; we worked with the authors of these datasets to correct and revalidate the labels.

We then combined all datasets per language, and we added unique example IDs including group (i.e. dataset) number, example index, and language code. For groups that submitted parallel datasets in multiple languages (e.g. Group 0065 for eight dialects of Arabic, or Group 0042 for Catalan and Peninsular Spanish), the parallel examples have the same group number and example index, only differing in language code. This allows the small number of parallel examples in the non-parallel split of the Global PIQA dataset to still be found.

#### D.2 Non-Parallel Split: English Annotations of Task Adherence and Cultural Specificity

Next, we used the machine-generated English translations of all examples to annotate cultural specificity and adherence to the task description. Annotations were completed by one of the primary authors, who is a native English speaker. As noted in §D.5, for 18 languages with lower-quality machine translations, these annotations were repeated after the English translations were corrected by native speakers.

Task adherence. Expanding on the original English PIQA dataset (Bisk et al., 2020), we include a variety of types of commonsense reasoning in Global PIQA, not just physical commonsense reasoning. Our definition of commonsense reasoning covers knowledge of physical properties of objects, affordances (types of actions an agent can perform with an object; Gibson, 1979; Jones et al., 2022), physical and temporal relations, cultural knowledge, and basic world knowledge. Notably, our definition is much broader than “intuitive physics”, i.e. the use of mental simulations to predict how objects will behave in some environment, which has been widely studied in cognitive science (e.g. Battaglia et al., 2013; Ullman et al., 2017; Piloto et al., 2022). In our broader definition, we use the following guidelines for adherence to the task description:

- 1. Drop examples that consist of a complex or abstract logical problem, as these do not fit the task description of commonsense reasoning. For example, we drop complex logic puzzles and computer programming questions.

- 2. Drop examples that appear both generic and extremely easy based on the English translation. For example, we drop examples such as “When you heat water, it becomes [hot/cold]”.
- 3. Keep examples that query common knowledge about locations (e.g. locations of cities or famous monuments, or common events to observe in particular cities).
- 4. Keep examples that query social or cultural knowledge. These examples often describe regional customs, norms, and traditions.
- 5. Where possible, drop examples that query obscure historical factoids. In some languages, there are too few total examples to drop all such examples, so a small number of historical knowledge questions are still present in the dataset. These examples are generally apparent from their English translations (§D.5).

Based on these guidelines, we dropped approximately 2K out of 31K examples in the submitted datasets, before subsampling for the official non-parallel split. In cases where this filtering caused the number of examples in a language to drop below 100 examples, we worked directly with authors to reach the 100 example minimum. We note that based on these guidelines, examples in Global PIQA cover a range of physical commonsense, social commonsense, cultural knowledge, and common knowledge.

Cultural specificity. Because cultural specificity is fairly subjective and perspective-dependent, we attempt to provide clear guidelines for when we annotated an example as “culturally-specific”. Our definition of culturally-specific covers both culturally-specific examples, i.e. examples that are only relevant in a specific region or language, and culturally-sensitive examples, i.e. examples whose solution varies across regions or languages (Myung et al., 2024; Singh et al., 2025). When we use the term “culturally specific”, we refer to this broad definition. We formulated the guidelines here in an attempt to reduce potential bias and the presence of stereotypes in our annotations of cultural specificity (Zhou et al., 2025). We annotate examples for cultural specificity using these guidelines:

- 1. Some datasets have some examples marked as culturally specific by the dataset authors. We annotate these examples as culturally specific; this defers to the authors (members of the cultural communities) to choose examples that they believe reflect their culture, giving more ownership back to the communities themselves.
- 2. We annotate examples as culturally specific if they describe specific holidays, folklore, traditions, sayings, or aphorisms in the language.
- 3. We annotate an example as culturally specific if its solution likely varies by region. For example, traffic rules and social norms are likely to vary across regions.
- 4. If an example contains a word that does not translate well into English, then we annotate it as culturally specific. This can include words for local food dishes, traditional objects or articles of clothing, or local brands. We do not count city names (or person names), as many examples that simply mention a city are not actually specific to that city. We acknowledge that some words are ambiguously “English” vs. borrowed from another language; in these cases, we use our best judgment based on how commonly the word is used in English.
- 5. We do not count the presence of local ingredients or objects if they have widely used English words, such as corn, rice, beans, or many fruits and vegetables, even if these items vary in popularity across regions. In other words, we do not annotate an example as culturally specific solely based on the presence of these items. This guideline aims to reduce bias where some examples might otherwise be annotated as culturally specific based on stereotypical associations between specific foods and corresponding regions or cultures.
- 6. In cases where the English machine translation appears to be extremely low quality, such that the topic of the example is not clear, we use our best judgment based on the previous guidelines. We lean towards annotating cultural specificity in borderline cases, because we expect that machine translation systems are more likely to perform poorly in culturally-specific scenarios (Naveen and Trojovsk`y, 2024; Yao et al., 2024).

Through these annotations, we primarily aim to have a coarse filter for cultural specificity, such that we can up-sample culturally-specific examples in the following section. In the full non-parallel dataset (i.e. before subsampling to the official split), 40.8% of examples are annotated as culturally specific. We note that even when marked as culturally specific, many examples do not actually require knowledge of the referenced culturally-specific item or tradition to correctly answer the prompt;

in many cases, the culturally-specific element is referenced, but the correct answer can be inferred naively from the rest of the context.

#### D.3 Additional Submission Selection Criteria

A prior version of this work listed co-authors at institutions on the US SDN list and used data provided by such individuals. Over the course of this project, policies at major machine learning publication venues were clarified, making it impossible to undergo peer review when collaborating with such individuals. Consequently, the current version of this work has been re-done without their contributions and they are not listed as authors.

#### D.4 Non-Parallel Split: Subsampling to the Official Split

Before subsampling, the Global PIQA non-parallel split is highly skewed across languages. For example, before subsampling, Hindi (hin_deva) and Yoruba (yor_latn) have 1.4K examples each, while many other languages have close to the minimum dataset submission requirement of 100 examples. The full dataset before subsampling is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/ mrlbenchmarks/global-piqa-nonparallel in the unsampled_full folder, containing 29.1K examples. Due to the imbalance across languages, we select a subsample of 100 diverse and maximally culturally-specific examples in each language as the official non-parallel split of Global PIQA. This enables efficient evaluations of state-of-the-art LLMs across all languages in Global PIQA.

When filtering, we apply the following stages per language; we continue to the next stage unless that stage would cause the dataset for the language to fall below 100 examples. This allows us to maximize the quality and diversity of the examples for each language while still maintaining at least 100 examples per language. We note that the extremely low quality examples and off-task examples were already filtered out by the cleaning and annotations in §D.1 and §D.2. We apply the following filtering stages in order (or until reaching 100 examples in the language):

- 1. We remove any duplicate prompts, i.e. examples that have the same prompt but different pairs of solutions. This is generally a very small number of examples (e.g. one or two examples), and zero examples for most datasets. This filtering step drops a total of 60 examples across all languages. Note that exact duplicate examples (i.e. same prompt and same solutions) were already removed in §D.1.
- 2. We filter out examples where the two candidate solutions differ in length by more than 25 English byte equivalents (this is roughly the same as English character equivalents, because most English characters are one byte in UTF-8). We compute English byte equivalents by computing the solution lengths first in raw UTF-8 bytes, then dividing by the language’s byte premium (Arnett et al., 2024), which is the estimated number of bytes used to encode text in the language compared to content-matched (parallel) text in English. We perform this filtering step to attempt to minimize any length biases in the dataset, where longer solutions might be assigned systematically lower probabilities than shorter solutions by pretrained-only models, leading to a bias towards shorter solutions for those models. This filtering step drops a total of 1.6K examples across all languages.
- 3. We filter out examples whose non-stopword tokens overlap by more than 50% with another example in the dataset. Specifically, we tokenize all examples using the Goldfish tokenizer for the language (Chang et al., 2024). For the 24 Global PIQA languages not covered by the 350 languages in Goldfish, we use a simple space-based tokenizer after removing common punctuation symbols; all Global PIQA languages without a Goldfish tokenizer use scripts that separate words with spaces. Upon tokenizing all examples, we define stopword tokens as tokens that appear in at least 25% of examples for the language. Then, we sort examples by length (in order to give longer examples priority), and we loop through all examples, dropping any examples in which greater than 50% of its non-stopword tokens are contained in another previously-encountered example. This filtering step aims to increase the diversity of examples in the official Global PIQA non-parallel split, particularly for languages with large numbers of examples covering similar topics. This filtering step drops a total of 1.2K examples across all languages.

Finally, we sample 100 examples from the filtered subset for each language. We sample culturallyspecific examples before non-culturally specific examples (as annotated in §D.2), and within each of these categories, we first sample examples that did not use any LLMs in the creation process. We shuffle the correct and incorrect solutions to balance 0 and 1 labels.

It is acceptable for the passages to contain unknown foreign words, which you should assume have unique but plausible definitions.

|---|

- Figure 5: Prompt template used to annotate whether English translations of solution pairs in the non-parallel split had a semantic difference, using Gemini 3.0 Flash. This was used to further verify the correctness of English translations, as all solution pairs should differ (because one is correct, and the other is incorrect). All examples failing this check went through additional human validation.

#### D.5 Non-Parallel Split: Secondary Validation and English Translation Corrections

After subsampling to the official non-parallel split, all examples with their English machine translations were sent to all authors again for secondary review. This secondary review was completed for 126 of the 136 language varieties in the non-parallel split.5 Authors were asked to correct the machine translations to English (from §D.1) and to verify the correctness of the original examples in the source language. Authors followed the same translation correction guidelines as for the parallel split, described in §E.3, but they were also asked to modify the source texts if any of the original examples were incorrect (e.g. grammatical errors, typos, or incorrect labels).

In the resulting corrections, 7.3% of examples were modified in the source language, with a mean character edit distance of 21.3 characters (mean 7.7% of characters) per modified example. Additionally, for Malayalam, 22 examples were replaced entirely, after authors identified that those examples were entirely nonsensical in Malayalam. In the English translations, across all languages, 48.7% of examples were modified, with a mean character edit distance of 26.9 characters (mean 8.5% of characters). For the 18 languages with a character edit rate (edit distance divided by original length) of greater than 10% in the English translation corrections, we repeated the task adherence and cultural specificity annotations in §D.2, as these were based on the uncorrected English translations. Uncorrected machine translations into English and edit distances per example are reported in our dataset on Hugging Face, in each example’s supplement field.

To further verify the correctness of the English translations, we used Gemini 3.0 Flash to annotate any English solution pairs with no “noticeable semantic difference” (prompt template in Figure 5), as all solution pairs should have some difference (because one is correct, and the other is incorrect). Any examples failing this check (approximately 2% of examples) went through additional human validation with native speakers of the original language. Finally, because many of our authors are not native English speakers, we used Gemini 3.0 Flash to identify any English translations that were ungrammatical after correction (prompt template in Figure 6). Any examples failing this check were edited by a native English speaker, consulting with authors who spoke the original language of the example if needed. This process was intended to make examples in the non-parallel split understandable to a broader audience, through accurate and grammatical English translations.

5Languages that did not undergo secondary review can be identified in the dataset, because their English translations are marked as uncorrected: “[machine_translated]”.

|Determine whether the following passage is grammatical in English. It is acceptable for the passage to contain unknown foreign words, which you should assume have unique but plausible definitions.

### E Parallel Split: Construction and Correction Details

#### E.1 Parallel Split: Constructing Examples in English

- As described in §4, examples in the parallel split of Global PIQA were first written by two native English speakers. Each example in the parallel split consists of a prompt (question) and four candidate solutions. We chose the question-answer format because most modern LLMs are instruction-tuned for question answering rather than text completion (Ouyang et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2022). Perhaps more importantly, it is not always possible to directly translate prompt-completion examples to languages with different sentence structures, because information appears in different orders across languages. For example, a subject-object prompt with a verb completion in an SOV language would have a very different format in a VSO language. The question-answer format ensures that each prompt is a standalone question, facilitating easier translation.

We wrote 109 questions with candidate solutions, drawing inspiration from previous commonsense reasoning datasets: the original English PIQA (physical commonsense; Bisk et al., 2020), EWoK (basic world knowledge; Ivanova et al., 2025), TRAM (temporal reasoning; Wang and Zhao, 2024), PROST (physical reasoning; Aroca-Ouellette et al., 2021), Glenberg and Robertson (2000) (object affordances), and HellaSwag (commonsense reasoning in physical situations; Zellers et al., 2019). The original English PIQA is released under an Academic Free License v. 3.0 license. TRAM and HellaSwag are released under an MIT license. PROST is released under an Apache-2.0 license. The stimuli from Glenberg and Robertson (2000) are not available publicly, and we did not use any items directly in the creation of the parallel split.

We also collected a small number of difficult examples from the non-parallel split of Global PIQA translated into English (§D.5), by filtering for examples that GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro, or Claude Sonnet

- 4.5 answered incorrectly; in this filtering, we only considered examples with unambiguously correct answers. Each example in the parallel split is annotated with the dataset from which it drew loose inspiration, or labeled as entirely novel.

When writing examples, we avoided writing extremely easy examples such as “When you put water in a refrigerator, it becomes [hot/cold]”, and we avoided including references to culturally-specific elements such as local foods or customs, to facilitate translation to a large number of languages. We also wrote examples to cover a variety of types of commonsense reasoning: object properties and interactions (67 examples), temporal reasoning (13 examples), basic counting (13 examples), spatial reasoning (25 examples), and affordances (23 examples). Some examples covered multiple commonsense reasoning types, and all examples are annotated with their reasoning types in the released parallel split. In the end, we wrote 109 questions in English; after translation corrections, these were filtered to 103 examples (or 101 examples for Ekpeye; §4).

|Translate the following into [TARGET_LANGUAGE]. Do not respond to the content of the question or phrase; *only* translate it. Respond only with the translation, with *no* additional text. Text to translate:<br><br>[TEXT_TO_TRANSLATE]|
|---|

- Figure 7: Translation prompt template used to translate examples into each target language for the parallel split, using Gemini 2.5 Pro and Gemini 3.0 Flash. All translations for the parallel split were human-corrected.

#### E.2 Parallel Split: Machine Translations

Next, we translated all examples written for the parallel split into the 131 language varieties covered in the split. These languages were selected based on availability of the authors who spoke those languages, along with additional recruitment after releasing the non-parallel split. Additional recruitment for the parallel split was primarily done through the connections of authors for the non-parallel split. For each target language, the first 50 examples in the parallel split were translated using Gemini 2.5 Pro. The remaining examples were translated using Gemini 3.0 Flash. The prompt template used is in Figure 7. Each prompt and candidate solution was translated separately, as we found a greater number of hallucinations when translating prompts and candidate solutions together (e.g. the LLM correcting incorrect candidate solutions if the prompt was included). However, we note that our approach of translating prompts and solutions separately introduced some inconsistencies between translations for prompts and solutions, e.g. for gender agreement and formatting of numerals in years (e.g. “2026” vs. “two thousand and twenty six”). Additionally, in some languages, the writing system used in translations for different examples was inconsistent. These inconsistencies were largely fixed during the translation correction stage.

#### E.3 Parallel Split: Translation Corrections

Finally, we sent the machine-translated examples to all authors for correction. Each source text with its machine translation was presented in a row in a Google Sheet (one sheet per language), and authors were asked to correct the machine translations. To mark each row as corrected, authors were asked to verify that (1) the meaning of the translation was correct, (2) the text sounded natural in the target language, and (3) the initially-labeled “correct” solution (always listed first) was indeed the correct solution, with all other candidate solutions being incorrect, even after translation into the target language. Full translation correction guidelines sent to authors are on our GitHub. To prevent duplicate work from multiple native speakers per example, each row was marked as corrected after at least one native speaker reviewed it.

When processing these translation corrections, we observed several common issues in the corrected sheets. First, sheet rows were sometimes swapped (e.g. by dragging rows in the Google Sheet), or corrected translations were pasted or typed into the incorrect cells. In some cases, authors initially corrected the source texts to match the meaning of the machine translations, rather than correcting the machine translations to match the source texts. We detected these issues using edit distances between texts before and after correction (e.g. a high edit distance to the uncorrected text, but a low edit distance to a different example, or edits only to the sources and not the translations). We also identified a small number of texts which were accidentally deleted instead of corrected, or examples where two of the solutions were identical after correction.

As a sanity check, we also checked all occurrences of special characters that might be artifacts of LLM translation (e.g. ‘<’, ‘>’, ‘[’, ‘]’, ‘(’, ‘)’, and ‘*’) and any substrings longer than 20 characters of the original translation prompts. For Arabic dialects, we removed diacritics using the dediac_ar function from CAMeL Tools (Alhafni et al., 2023), based on feedback from authors who are native speakers of Arabic. In all of the cases above, along with cases where the authors left a note in an optional notes column, we manually checked those examples, in consultation with the authors who spoke that target language if needed.

### F Non-Parallel Split: Ad Hoc Human Evaluations

We do not explicitly perform a human evaluation study due to the substantial resources that it would take to run a study for the large number of languages involved in Global PIQA. However, several groups reported human evaluations on their dataset contributions to the non-parallel split, where a native speaker was asked to choose correct solutions without access to the “ground truth” labels, or inter-annotator agreement percentages were reported (from which we can compute an analogy to human “accuracy” by treating the other annotator’s labels as the “ground truth”). On top of this, we conducted ad hoc human evaluation with one author (a native speaker of Mandarin Chinese) for the Mandarin Chinese datasets (simplified and traditional Chinese characters, cmn_hans and cmn_hant) in the Global PIQA official non-parallel split, after observing somewhat low scores in the language for some models (e.g. GPT-5 with less than 90% accuracy, given that Mandarin Chinese is a high-resource language). Accuracies for individual human annotators for the 12 language varieties with available human results are shown in Table 3.

In these ad hoc human evaluations, mean human annotator accuracy was 95.1%, and none of the fifteen individual annotators had accuracy below 91%. Of course, we note that there is likely some sampling bias, where dataset authors who chose to run human evaluations were also more likely to construct high quality datasets in the first place. That said, we even observe high accuracies for Mandarin Chinese (95% and 93%), in which we ran our ad hoc human evaluation after dataset submissions and compilation, independent of the dataset authors. These results suggest that human accuracy on the Global PIQA non-parallel split is likely to be at least 90%, and potentially as high as 95%. After running these ad hoc evaluations, examples were updated based on disagreeing labels.

### G Evaluation Details

As described in §5.1, we evaluate pretrained-only models with the cloze evaluation format and instruction-tuned models with the generation evaluation format. For the cloze evaluations, we normalize solution log-probabilities by the length of each solution in bytes; we do not need to use English byte equivalents normalized per language (“byte premiums”; Arnett et al., 2024), because for each example, this would only divide each log-probability by a constant, leaving the ranking of solutions unchanged. Both the cloze and generation evaluation formats are implemented on the LM Evaluation Harness, with our implementation available at: https://github.com/mrlbenchmarks/ lm-eval-global-piqa (to be merged into the official LM Evaluation Harness branch soon).

For the generation evaluations, we use the prompt templates in Figure 8, generating a maximum of 2048 response tokens per question. For open and open-weight models, we sample using temperature τ = 0.90 and top-p = 0.80; for closed models, we use temperature τ = 0.90. For closed systems with “thinking" models, we allow up to 1024 thinking tokens, with the remaining 1024 token budget allocated to the response. Gemini 3.1 and Claude Sonnet 4.6 allow setting this directly, but GPT-5.4 only supports “low”, “medium”, and “high” thinking. We use “medium” thinking for GPT-5.4 with a total generation length of 2048 tokens, to be comparable to the other models. For a small number of responses (about 1-3% of responses, primarily in lower-resource languages), GPT-5.4 (Regular, Mini, and Nano) exceeded its token budget, and we reran it with “low” thinking. After sampling responses, we used string matching (e.g. “best answer is: A” or “best answer is: B”, as specified in the prompt template instructions) to mark answers as correct or incorrect.

|Given the following situation, which option is more likely to be correct?<br><br>Situation: [PROMPT] ...<br><br>Option A: [SOLUTION0]<br>Option B: [SOLUTION1]<br><br><br>Your response should end with "The best answer is: [answer_letter]" where [answer_letter] is one of A or B.|

- Figure 8: Prompt templates for the generation-style evaluation format (§5.1), for the non-parallel (top) and parallel (bottom) split of Global PIQA. In the parallel split, all prompts are formatted as questions, and there are four candidate solutions.

All open-weight models were run using 8x A6000 or 8x A100 (80GB each) for a total of 1480.4 GPU hours (367.3 A100 hours and 1113.1 A6000 hours). Running Claude Sonnet 4.6 cost $61.23 for 4.9M input tokens and 7.2M output tokens. Running the OpenAI models cost $97.04 for 11.0M input tokens and 25.9M output tokens. Running the Gemini models cost $155.45 for 14.6M input tokens and 75.7M output tokens.

#### G.1 Full List of Models

We evaluate several large well-known LLMs on Global PIQA, along with a wide variety of open and open-weight models. We prioritize models that were requested by the authors of the datasets, and we prioritize models pretrained from scratch over adapted and fine-tuned models. We did not evaluate Claude Opus because we estimated the cost at $400, which is more than the cost of running all the other closed systems combined. Due to hardware limitations, for open-weight models, we focus on dense models ranging from 300M to 120B parameters. All raw evaluation scores for each model (results by language and non-parallel vs. parallel split) are available on our GitHub. In total, we evaluate Global PIQA on 146 models, including seven closed models and 139 open-weight models:

Parameters

- Figure 9: Accuracy averaged across all languages vs. parameter count for open-weight models, on the parallel split of Global PIQA. All evaluations here use the generation-style task format. We display names of top-performing models. Shape indicates model family, and color indicates openness (open-weight in purple vs. fully open in pink, including open data). All other models are plotted as dots. Chance performance (25%) and performance of top closed systems are plotted as dashed lines.

#### H.2 Results Per Region for All Models

Figures 10 and 11 show average performance per region and per resource level for all models we evaluated. For resource levels, we use the language resource level classifications from Joshi et al. (2020), mapping 0 and 1 to “low-resource”, 2 and 3 to “medium-resource”, and 4 and 5 to “highresource”. For regions, we group the North American and South American languages with the European languages in the figures, because all languages from the Americas in Global PIQA are originally European languages that are now spoken in the Americas. In our results, the languages in each region are defined as:

- • Central Asia: bxr_cyrl (Russian Buryat), kaz_cyrl (Kazakh), kir_cyrl (Kyrgyz), uig_arab (Uighur), uzn_latn (Northern Uzbek).
- • East Asia: cmn_hans (Mandarin Chinese), cmn_hant (Mandarin Chinese), jpn_jpan (Japanese), kor_hang (Korean), yue_hant (Yue Chinese, Cantonese).
- • Eastern Europe: als_latn (Tosk Albanian), azj_latn (North Azerbaijani), bel_cyrl (Belarusian), bul_cyrl (Bulgarian), ces_latn (Czech), ckm_latn (Chakavian), ell_grek (Greek), ekk_latn (Estonian), hrv_latn (Croatian), hun_latn (Hungarian), hye_armn (Eastern Armenian), kat_geor (Georgian), lit_latn (Lithuanian), mkd_cyrl (Macedonian), pol_latn (Polish), ron_latn (Romanian), slk_latn_sari (Šariš Slovak), slv_latn_cerk (Slovenian, Cerkno), slv_latn_prle (Slovenian, Prlekija), srp_cyrl (Serbian), srp_cyrl_torl (Serbian Torlak), srp_latn (Serbian), srp_latn_torl (Serbian Torlak), tur_latn (Turkish), ukr_cyrl (Ukrainian), bos_latn (Bosnian), rus_cyrl (Russian), slk_latn (Slovak), slv_latn (Slovenian).
- • Middle East: acq_arab (Yemeni Arabic), afb_arab (Gulf Arabic), apc_arab_jord (Jordanian Arabic), apc_arab_leba (Lebanese Arabic), apc_arab_pale (Palestinian Arabic), apc_arab_syri (Syrian Arabic), arb_arab (Modern Standard Arabic), ars_arab (Najdi Arabic), ckb_arab (Central Kurdish), heb_hebr (Hebrew), pes_arab (Western Farsi), acm_arab (Iraqi Arabic).

### I Non-Parallel Split: Individual Dataset Descriptions

Here, we provide brief descriptions of the methods that individual groups used to construct their contributions to the non-parallel split of Global PIQA (§3). Longer dataset description papers that authors consented to release are at https://github.com/mrlbenchmarks/global-piqa. Authors were recruited and organized as described in §C, and all contributors were offered authorship. The vast majority have chosen to be authors on this paper. This project would not be possible without the efforts of all authors.

We note that we intentionally do not list authors with their groups and languages. This is to preserve privacy, as some authors would prefer not to be contacted by unaffiliated projects that require expertise in their language. Skipped group numbers indicate groups whose datasets were not accepted to Global PIQA, often because they did not complete their datasets or did not respond to feedback to correct their datasets (§C).

- Group 0000: Hindi (hin_deva: 94 examples) Manually written in English by a native Hindi speaker, machine-translated into Hindi using Google Translate, then checked, corrected, and refined by the dataset author. Approximately 25% of examples are designed to be culturally-grounded, with references to specific Indian culinary items, musical instruments, common fauna, and social traditions, such as customs within a wedding ceremony.
- Group 0001: Telugu (tel_telu: 131 examples) Manually written by a native Telugu speaker, with examples crafted to reflect realistic scenarios encountered in Telugu households, agriculture, cooking, transportation, and daily problem-solving. Each question was double-checked, and edge cases and ambiguous situations were discarded to ensure high quality.
- Group 0002: French (Canadian) (fra_latn_cana: 155 examples) Topic ideas were brainstormed using LLMs, but examples were all written manually. All examples were checked or written by a native speaker.
- Group 0003: Yoruba (yor_latn: 120 examples) Examples from English PIQA were translated and culturally adapted to Yoruba by a native Yoruba speaker. Care was taken to preserve Yoruba idiomatic forms, and for culturally unique contexts, questions were created directly in Yoruba rather than translated. Culturally-specific domains include cooking, clothing, farming, weather, transportation, religion, household practices, and festivals.
- Group 0004: French (fra_latn_fran: 100 examples) Manually written by a native French speaker, with examples crafted by observing daily life and social interactions, and by browsing French websites for topics such as furniture, home goods, sports, and news. Many examples were designed to be specific to French culture, e.g. including French food and social norms, or how to take the metro in Paris.
- Group 0005: Finnish (fin_latn: 100 examples) Manually written by a native Finnish speaker, with many examples covering Finnish culture and everyday life. Topics include traditional foods, household chores, log cabin terms, saunas, winter activities, reindeer-related terms, and Finnish sports and traditions.
- Group 0006: Hungarian, Romanian (hun_latn: 100 examples, ron_latn: 100 examples) Examples were written in English, translated into Hungarian and Romanian (by native speakers of those languages), and reviewed by another translator. All translators and editors were offered authorship.
- Group 0007: Ukrainian (ukr_cyrl: 100 examples) Manually written by a native Ukrainian speaker, and checked by another native speaker, both from Western Ukraine. Topics were inspired by Ukrainian websites and blogs, as well as personal knowledge, covering Ukrainian cuisine, traditions, superstitions, and local Ukrainian festivities.

- Group 0008: Mandarin (cmn_hans: 100 examples, cmn_hant: 98 examples) Manually written by a native Mandarin speaker and verified by another native speaker. Examples were balanced across culturally-specific food, clothing and materials, musical instruments, and other objects. Examples were written using Chinese simplified characters, but also translated into traditional characters using Google Translate with human verification.
- Group 0009: Hebrew (heb_hebr: 67 examples) Manually written by a native Hebrew speaker, with examples covering specific Hebrew linguistic constructions, along with Israeli cultural knowledge, such as places, food, climate, and Jewish religion and culture. By design, some items may resist direct translation into other languages, and in some cases, translation may alter the validity of the designated correct answer.
- Group 0010: Indonesian (ind_latn: 204 examples) Examples were generated with the assistance of ChatGPT (GPT-5) using carefully guided prompts to produce PIQA-style examples. All examples were manually reviewed, corrected, and finalized by a native speaker of Indonesian to ensure quality, correctness, and cultural relevance. Because the original LLM-generated examples were often fairly generic, at least 50 examples were manually edited to reflect uniquely Indonesian contexts (e.g. local foods, household practices, and traditional objects). The dataset was written in Standard Indonesian (Bahasa Indonesia).
- Group 0011: Italian (ita_latn: 100 examples) Manually written by a native Italian speaker. ChatGPT was occasionally used to correct typos or to find appropriate words that did not immediately come to mind, but never to generate examples themselves. All final versions of examples were human verified. To include examples reflecting Italian culture, some examples were motivated by online recipes and websites in Italian.
- Group 0012: Hausa (hau_latn: 100 examples) Manually written by a native Hausa speaker, using culturally-relevant themes to motivate example creation. Themes included traveling, food, school, exams, driving, and health.
- Group 0013: Portuguese (Brazilian) (por_latn_braz: 100 examples) Manually written by a native Brazilian Portuguese speaker, covering food, traditions, regional objects, daily activities, and environmental contexts that are common to Brazil, particularly southern Brazil.
- Group 0014: Dutch (nld_latn: 120 examples) Manually written by a native Dutch speaker, using specific culturally-relevant topics to motivate example creation. Topics include bicycle maintenance techniques, preparation of traditional Dutch foods, managing Dutch rainfall, and navigating Amsterdam’s narrow spaces. All examples were verified by another native speaker.
- Group 0015: Tagalog / Filipino (tgl_latn: 103 examples) Manually written by a native Tagalog speaker. A separate Filipino dataset was not included, as many native speakers of Tagalog do not draw a strong distinction between the two. Examples in this dataset were written to be culturally-specific to the Philippines, covering three main topics: (1) cooking and baking, (2) crafts and construction of cultural objects, and (3) art, dances, and literature. The author cross-checked information using websites such as Philippine Wikipedia, Philippine government blogs on culture, and informal verification from fellow native speakers living in the Philippines.
- Group 0016: Vietnamese (vie_latn: 100 examples) Manually written by a native Vietnamese speaker, and examples contain Vietnamese cultural contexts such as everyday objects, weather, clothing, routines, safety, school, simple social norms, and holidays.
- Group 0017: Russian, Iraqi Arabic (Gelet) (rus_cyrl: 100 examples, acm_arab: 121 examples) Manually written by native Russian and Iraqi Arabic (Gelet) speakers, covering everyday topics such as weather, transportation, home safety, work, hobbies, nature, sports, school, and technology. For a more culturally-specific subset, approximately 20 examples for Iraqi Arabic were translated from the Modern Standard Arabic dataset from Group 0065; a native speaker of Iraqi Arabic selected examples that were culturally relevant to their region.

- Group 0018: Korean (kor_hang: 100 examples) Manually written and verified by three native Korean speakers. Examples were written to cover popular Korean games, food, and mandatory military service.
- Group 0019: Mandarin (cmn_hans: 93 examples) Manually written by a native Mandarin speaker, covering traditional Chinese culture, food, objects, everyday life, customs, and computer use. Some examples were motivated by reading guidebooks on transportation, cooking, or safety operations. Some examples were also designed to cover recently-developed technologies from within the past five to ten years.
- Group 0020: Kannada (kan_knda: 99 examples) Manually written by a native Kannada speaker, and verified by another native speaker. Examples reflect cultural aspects of Karnataka (an Indian state where Kannada is widely spoken), as well as everyday scenarios.
- Group 0021: Yoruba (yor_latn: 99 examples) Manually written by a native Yoruba speaker, and verified by another native speaker. Examples are written to be relevant to the Yoruba land, including festivals, traditions, foods, and clothing.
- Group 0022: Slovenian, Croatian, Serbian, Macedonian, Slovenian Cerkno, Chakavian (slv_latn: 100 examples, hrv_latn: 100 examples, srp_latn: 149 examples, srp_cyrl: 150 examples, mkd_cyrl: 100 examples, slv_latn_cerk: 100 examples, ckm_latn: 100 examples)

Manually written by native speakers of Slovenian, Croatian, Serbian, Macedonian, and two dialects: Slovenian Cerkno and Croatian Chakavian. Authors attempted to include culturally-relevant examples for their language(s). Examples were motivated by everyday objects, life hacks, recipes, and/or assembly manuals in each language. For each dataset, another co-author with significant understanding of the language or dialect solved the task without access to labels. Human accuracies were 97%, 100%, 97%, and 92%, excluding the two low-resource dialects. Labels were adjusted based on disagreements from this cross-check.

- Group 0023: Tagalog (tgl_latn: 100 examples) Manually written by a native Tagalog speaker, using both common spoken Tagalog (Northern and Manila dialects) and the Filipino dialect. Writing style varies between street-spoken Tagalog and formal Tagalog, and topics focus on daily life in the agricultural town of Talavera, Nueva Ecija (e.g. fishing and cooking). Some examples were inspired by Instructables posts, adapted to be culturally-relevant.
- Group 0024: French (fra_latn_fran: 115 examples) Manually written and reviewed by native French speakers, using French as spoken in mainland France. Examples were written by observing everyday actions, with distracting information added to some prompts to make the examples more challenging.
- Group 0025: Polish (pol_latn: 130 examples) Manually written and reviewed by native Polish speakers. Authors drew upon their knowledge of Polish history, culture, customs, and everyday habits.
- Group 0026: Norwegian Bokmål, Norwegian Nynorsk (nob_latn: 117 examples, nno_latn: 117 examples)

Manually written in Norwegian Bokmål by native Norwegian speakers, including examples covering local foods, activities, traditions, folklore, and indigenous culture. Text embedding similarity search and then manual verification were used to ensure that examples were not direct translations of English PIQA. Examples were translated into Norwegian Nynorsk using the Nynorsk dictionary from LEXIN OsloMet, and checked by a Norwegian speaker who used Norwegian Nynorsk in school.

- Group 0027: Malay (zsm_latn: 100 examples) Manually written by a native Malay speaker, using Standard Malay (Bahasa Melayu). Examples were designed to cover local commonsense, social norms, food and drink, religious life, and ev-

- eryday routines. Examples were written with natural Malay phrasing and colloquial register where appropriate.
- Group 0028: Faroese (fao_latn: 100 examples) Manually written and reviewed by native Faroese speakers. Approximately 35 examples were written to be specific to the Faroe Islands, focusing on Faroese food preparation and preservation techniques, weather patterns, traditional clothing, wool and knitting, and geography.
- Group 0029: Urdu (urd_arab: 115 examples) This dataset was written by native Urdu speakers, using Gemini 2.5 Flash and Claude Sonnet 4 for example clarification and refinement. Local websites such as UrduPoint were used to motivate examples, and examples were designed to reflect everyday life in Pakistan, including Pakistani food preparation, household practices, social customs, and traditional crafts. The dataset is written in Standard Pakistani Urdu, with every example checked by at least two native speakers.
- Group 0030: Uzbek (uzn_latn: 101 examples) Manually written by a native Northern Uzbek speaker, drawing from real-life experiences and commonly-used expressions in Uzbek. Colloquial phrases are used where appropriate. The dataset is written using Latin script, although Cyrillic script is also widely used in Uzbekistan.
- Group 0031: Icelandic (isl_latn: 100 examples) Manually written by native Icelandic speakers, covering culturally-specific topics such as food and cooking, holidays and traditions, civics and culture, folklore, geography, history, and agriculture. Some examples were inspired by browsing the Icelandic science web (https://www. visindavefur.is/).

Relevant to anyone using this dataset, the dataset authors note the distinction between no‘ono‘o Hawai‘i (Hawaiian ways of thinking) and no‘ono‘o Haole (foreign ways of thinking) as applied to NLP, where “data representation choices risk importing external frameworks. Preserving no‘ono‘o Hawai‘i ensures that datasets and computational models reflect culturally grounded perspectives, maintaining authenticity and integrity in the development of Hawaiian language technologies”.

### J Declaration of AI Usage

No AI was used in the writing of this paper. A minority of contributors used AI in the process of creating examples for the non-parallel split of Global PIQA, which we discuss in §3.2. In the final non-parallel dataset, less than 5% of examples were originally written with the help of LLMs, and all examples have been human-verified. No AI was used to generate the original English version of the parallel split of Global PIQA. AI was used for initial machine translations of the parallel split, but these translations have all been human-verified, as discussed in §4. AI was used to assist in basic tasks when processing and visualizing model evaluation results for §5.3.
