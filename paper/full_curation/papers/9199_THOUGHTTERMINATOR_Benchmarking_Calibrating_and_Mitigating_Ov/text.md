##### Abstract

Reasoning models have demonstrated impressive performance on difficult tasks that traditional language models struggle at. However, many are plagued with the problem of overthinking—generating large amounts of unnecessary tokens which don’t improve accuracy on a question. We introduce approximate measures of problem-level difficulty and demonstrate that a clear relationship between problem difficulty and optimal token spend exists, and evaluate how well calibrated a variety of reasoning models are in terms of efficiently allocating the optimal token count. We find that in general, reasoning models are poorly calibrated, particularly on easy problems. To evaluate calibration on easy questions we introduce DUMB500, a dataset of extremely easy math, reasoning, code, and task problems, and jointly evaluate reasoning model on these simple examples and extremely difficult examples from existing frontier benchmarks on the same task domain. Finally, we introduce THOUGHTTERMINATOR, a training-free black box decoding technique that significantly improves reasoning model calibration.

##### 1 Introduction

Investment in improving the capabilities of language models has recently turned from dataand train-time-scaling to inference-scaling, or training so-called reasoning models to expend more runtime compute generating chains of thought (Wei et al., 2022), debate (Liang et al., 2023), and self-corrections (Pan et al., 2024) in order to more robustly and correctly answer queries (Wu et al., 2024).

On average, there is a direct relationship between amount of inference spend and performance on benchmarks of a variety of “reasoning tasks” (Jaech et al., 2024).

Under the inference scaling paradigm, controlling costs is critical. Unfortunately, open reasoning models such as DeepSeek r1 (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025) and QwQ (Qwen, 2025) have demonstrated a tendency to expend unnecessary inference tokens after the answer has already could be generated, a problem referred to as overthinking (Chen et al., 2024).

We need to precisely define overthinking in order to mitigate it. Chen et al. (2024) define overthinking as the amount of times the model repeats the correct answer in its intermediate reasoning chain. From this definition, they used supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization to train reasoning models to prefer to select the shortest answer. Similar work applied knowledge distillation from non-reasoning models to blend their preference to answer concisely with the reasoning models’ better performance (Yang et al., 2025). However, both of these methods require retraining, a process that may be costly or have unintended consequences on performance.

Training-free methods which seek to manage overthinking include selective invocation of chain-of-thought on tasks where it has known benefit (Sprague et al., 2024) early stopping

of reasoning chains using probe-based confidence of final answer tokens (Fu et al., 2024), or simply eliciting reasoning model-like behavior from non-reasoning models using continuing phrases like “wait...”, which can be halted at any time (Muennighoff et al., 2025). Limitations of these methods include requiring external knowledge of task type, white-box access to the base model, or the use of non-reasoning models for precise control (Yu et al., 2025).

In this work we seek to analyze the difficulty calibration of token spend in reasoning models. Starting from the supposition that more difficult problems require more thought, we first characterize this difficulty-cost relationship in a variety of open reasoning models across three reasoning datasets—MATH500 (Lightman et al., 2023), GPQA (Rein et al., 2023), and ZebraLogic (Lin et al., 2024)—allowing us to introduce a difficulty-calibrated measure of overthinking.

- As these three existing datasets only allow us to assess overthinking in reasoning models on hard problems, we introduce DUMB500, a dataset of ‘easy’ queries to explore overthinking on easy inputs.

With the overthinking problem formally defined, we introduce THOUGHTTERMINATOR, a training-free, black box decoding strategy to mitigate overthinking using difficulty-calibrated conditioning. We show that THOUGHTTERMINATOR is a simple and effective way to control overthinking in reasoning models without requiring any access to gradients or training.

##### 2 Difficulty Calibration in Reasoning Models

This work is concerned with how optimally reasoning models allocate token spend Sp, or total number of tokens generated in a given sample to respond to an input.

Given that increased inference scale leads to higher performance across a variety of reasoning tasks, it is reasonable to hypothesize that the difficulty of a question correlates with optimal token spend. We characterize the difficulty D of a given question q pair for model M as the simple inaccuracy rate of that model over that pair over n samples of that question q and it’s gold answer a.

### DM(q,a) = p(aˆ ∼ M(q) ̸= a) ≈ ∑

1(M(q) ̸= a)/n (1)

n

We can compute a multi-model difficulty estimate D¯ of q as the expected difficulty E[D(q, a)] over a class of models M. While this definition is model-dependent, it captures an operational notion of difficulty that is both reproducible and relevant for analyzing inference efficiency under current LLMs.

D¯(q) = E[D(q,a)] ≈ ∑

Table 1: Local and global overthinking scores (rounded to integers).

Each answer ai incidentally sampled from M in response to question q is associated with its own token spend SpM(ai). Is there a relationship between the difficulty of each question and the token spend that naturally occurs?

We assess the difficulty D¯ and token spend SpM using reasoning and non-reasoning models from the DeepSeek (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025), Qwen (Yang et al., 2024; Qwen, 2025), Gemma (Mesnard et al., 2024), and LLaMa (Dubey et al., 2024) families for all questions in the MATH500 (Lightman et al., 2023), GPQA (Rein et al., 2023), and ZebraLogic (Lin et al., 2024) datasets.

- Figure 1 contains scatter plots of DM and Sp(a) for each answer a from DeepSeek-R1-7B for all three datasets. We observe that similar to the dataset & model-wise relationships between performance and token spend documented in prior work (Muennighoff et al., 2025), there also exists a clear relationship between question-level difficulty and average token spend.

Additionally, we note considerable variance in the token spend between answer samples for each question. These reasoning models exhibit considerable inconsistency in their efficiency between samples. This leads to two natural questions:

- 1. How well-calibrated are reasoning models in consistently realizing their optimal token spend per-question?
- 2. Is it possible to improve the calibration of reasoning models in their token spend?

###### 2.1 Quantifying Overthinking

We formalize observational overthinking, or the failure in consistency a reasoning model has at realizing the minimum possible token spend per question.

The observed minimum spend of a question is the shortest reasoning chain of its full set of correct model-generated answers. We measure observational overthinking in terms of the difference between a model’s typical token spend and this observed minimum. For questions sampled from dataset D, the global overthinking score Og of a model is the mean difference between the length of each reasoning chain and the global observed minimum spend for each question.

Og(M) = ∑

q∈D

E[Sp(a ∼ M|q)] − min

(Sp(a ∼ Mi|q)) /|D| (3)

Mi∈M

The local envelope overthinking score Oenv is the mean difference between the maximum and minimum spends for each question for each model.

- Table 1 presents the calibration scores for the full set of LLama, Qwen, Gemma, and DeepSeek models we evaluated on the three datasets. These calibration scores represent expected quantities of tokens wasted, as they are averages in excess of minimum spend values. Lower is better. As expected, the reasoning models with propensity to overthink have considerably higher overthinking scores than the non-reasoning models.

One weakness of our overthinking evaluation so far is that we have very few questions that have a low difficulty but high overthinking tendency. This is because reasoning models are evaluated mainly on challenging frontier tasks. In the next section we introduce a resource to mitigate this.

- 3 Extending Overthinking Evaluation with DUMB500

While it is common knowledge that reasoning models tend to overthink on simple queries (Chen et al., 2024), no resource has been proposed to systematically evaluate this tendency on simple, straightforward questions.

To address this gap, we introduce DUMB500, a dataset specifically designed to evaluate models on simple questions that humans can answer effortlessly. The goal is not to challenge models with intricate logic but rather to assess their fundamental ability to recognize simplicity and provide concise, correct responses. To the best of our knowledge, DUMB500 is the first dataset explicitly focused on extremely simple (and sometimes deliberately naive) questions. DUMB500 consists of 500 manually curated questions spanning four domains:

- • Mathematics (Math): Basic arithmetic, comparisons, geometric properties, and logical reasoning.
- • Conversational Interaction (Chat): Casual dialogue, self-reflection, common knowledge, and basic object interactions.

[Figure 9]

- Figure 3: Total difficulty distribution of the four datasets we evaluate in this work. Difficulty scores are scaled by 10 and mapped to integers from 1 to 10 for readability. By including DUMB500 in our analysis, we are able to characterize the overthinking behavior of current opening reasoning models more consistently accross the difficulty spectrum.

- • Programming & Computing (Code): Fundamental coding concepts, including variables, loops, conditionals, and data structures.
- • Task Execution (Task): Simple natural language processing tasks such as paraphrasing, translation, and basic writing.

Each question is designed to be trivial for humans, requiring minimal cognitive effort, while still serving as a litmus test for language models. The dataset allows us to evaluate models based on two key dimensions:

- • Accuracy: Can the model correctly answer simple questions?
- • Efficiency: Can the model provide concise answers without unnecessary elaboration?

To construct the dataset, we manually crafted the questions to ensure their simplicity and logical clarity. We also ensured diversity across categories, covering a range of common knowledge, arithmetic, and practical applications. The full list of question classes with their descriptions are listed in subsection A.1. Figure 2 shows the distribution of question types in DUMB500 as well as sample questions and answers.

###### 3.1 Evaluation techniques for DUMB500

In addition to the extremely simple MATH questions presented in DUMB500, which are evaluated using simple accuracy methods, identical to MATH500, GPQA, and ZebraLogic, we also introduced CHAT, CODE, and TASK questions, which require more sophisticated evaluation. They are evaluated as follows:

CODE questions include a set of test cases for the program described in the prompt. A python-based autograder checks that the requirements are met.

CHAT questions belong to one of seven subtasks (eg., greetings, acknowledgement). All chat answers are evaluated according to a set of generic requirements, such as appropriateness and conciseness. Depending on the subtask, specific requirements such as precision and accuracy are checked. When accuracy assessment is required, an answer is also provided.

TASK questions generally include instructions for the assistant to produce some kind of writing or answer some work-related question. In additino to using the same generic requirements as CHAT, TASK questions have one or more question-specific requirements which check that the implicit instructions in the prompt are followed (See Figure 2). The CHAT and TASK requirements are checked using an LM (gpt-4o) as a judge.

[Figure 10]

- Figure 4: Relationship between average token spend Sp (Tokens) and average score for the evaluated models on each subset of DUMB500.

###### 3.2 From Dumb to Hard Questions

We evaluate the same set of models as in Table 1 on DUMB500 and analyze their accuracy and token spend across different subsets. Figure 3 depicts the distribution of questionwise difficulty scores across the MATH subset of DUMB500, MATH500, GPQA, and ZebraLogic, assessed using those models. This confirms that DUMB500-MATH fills in a gap in our analysis, adding a considerable quantity of easy questions with which to analyze overthinking.

- Figure 4 shows the relationship between model-level accuracy and token spend for the tested models. As expected, on these simple math questions there is no positive relationship between token spend and accuracy, as these questions are extremely easy. For the other domains, we observe a negative correlation1 between token spend and evaluation requirement pass rate (labeled accuracy).

##### 4 THOUGHTTERMINATOR

Reasoning models often express inference scaling in natural language through tokens expressing uncertainty, like ”wait...” or ”let me check this...” (Muennighoff et al., 2025) Thus, overthinking often manifests as a tendency to overuse these extending expressions superfluously after the correct answer has already been found.

From this insight, we hypothesize that simple text-augmentation methods can be used to counteract this tendency, reminding the model of how long its output has been, and how soon it should come to an answer. THOUGHTTERMINATOR realizes this as a series of interrupt messages at a fixed token interval which are inserted into the autoregressive stream, alerting the model of how many tokens it has spent and how many remain.

Sometimes, these timing messages and reminders alone are sufficient to get the model to provide its answer in a concise manner. If a answer isn’t provided before the end of the time limit, a terminating prompt and constrained decoding forces the model to output a final answer.

1While we encountered some complications in consistently extracting the CHAT and TASK answer snippets across the diverse output formats employed by different models, a problem that can sometimes be worsened by longer context, particularly in LM judging, Appendix Table 4 demonstrates that length effects on scoring consistency are probably negligible—whether we attempt to extract answers from early, late, or combined segments of the model output, the within-model scores remain consistent.

35 students attend a meeting. There is a multiple of 13 girls attending, and more girls than boys. How many boys are at the meeting?

Vanilla reasoning model Thought Terminator

[Figure 11]

[Figure 12]

Okay, so I have this problem here about a math club meeting with 35 students. The number of girls is a multiple of 13, and there are more girls…

I think I only need around 600 tokens to solve.

[Figure 13]

(many tokens later) Also, given that G is a multiple of 13. That means G can be 13, 26, 39, etc., but since the total number of students is 35, the number of girls…

600 tokens remaining. I’ll be back.

[Figure 14]

[Figure 15]

Alright, let's try to figure out this problem. There are 35 students in total in the math club meeting. We know that the number of girls is a multiple of 13, and there are more girls than boys…

[Figure 16]

But wait, we also have the condition that there are more girls than boys, which translates to G > B. Since G + B = 35, I can rewrite this as G > 35 - …

[Figure 17]

(many tokens later)

100 tokens remaining. I’ll be back.

[Figure 18]

Then, the number of boys would be 35 - G = 35 26 = 9. Let me check if this makes sense…

Therefore, the number of boys at the meeting is 9.

[Figure 19]

Just to double-check, let me add them up: 26 girls + 9 boys = 35 students total. Yep, that adds up. Also, 26 is indeed a multiple of 13, and 26 is greater than 9, so all the given conditions are satisfied. But wait, I think…

[Figure 20]

**Final Answer** The number of boys at the meeting is 9. In summary, we have determined…

[Figure 21]

Time is up. Answer NOW

[Figure 22]

[Figure 23]

…girls than boys, we need to determine the number of boys. Thus, the number of boys at the meeting is \(\boxed{9}\)

There are 9 boys at the meeting.

Correct in 645 tokens.

Correct in 1358 tokens.

- Figure 5: THOUGHTTERMINATOR uses a reasoning model’s (calibrated) estimate of the difficulty of a problem to set its intervention, periodically interrupting the reasoning model’s output to remind it of the amount of remaining tokens. Once the token allotment has been used, it forces the model to provide an answer with constrained decoding.

- Figure 5 shows an example of a base reasoning model and one using THOUGHTTERMINATOR answering a question. THOUGHTTERMINATOR operates on a reasoning chain in three stages: scheduling, running, and terminating.

Scheduling. Given an input question THOUGHTTERMINATOR needs an estimate of how many tokens are necessary to produce a correct answer in order to set its interrupt rate and termination time.

Under our difficulty-calibrated token budget hypothesis, we assume that the number of required tokens can be estimated based on the difficulty of the question. In deployment, THOUGHTTERMINATOR is used in the tool-use paradigm, where a running model makes its own estimate of the difficulty of an input question and then invokes it.

We experiment with both a trained difficulty estimator and a zero-shot one (gpt-4o) to produce token spend estimates for each problem to characterize performance in this setting. To train a difficulty estimator, we divide the training set questions into 10 balanced bins based on their difficulty scores. We then finetune a Llama-3-8B-Instruct model to predict the difficulty level of a given question. To convert the predicted difficulty level into an appropriate number of answer tokens, we compute the averaged length of minimal successful answers for each difficulty level in the training set.

Running. Once the deadline has been set in scheduling, the base reasoning model’s generation process runs. Every n = min(250,deadline/2) steps an interrupt message2 is inserted into the token stream, notifying the model of how many tokens have been used and how many remain.

##### 5 Results

- Figure 6 shows the performance and token spend of five DeepSeek and QwQ reasoning models in the base setting (triangle marker) and with THOUGHTTERMINATOR (star marker). Table 2 shows the change in overthinking scores reasoning models exhibit from base setting to THOUGHTTERMINATOR.

4/5 models on MATH500, 2/3 models on GPQA, and all models on Zebra and DUMB500MATH see significant decrease in overthinking for effectively equivalent (or better) Pass@10 performance under THOUGHTTERMINATOR than under standard decoding. Globally, overthinking scores drop dramatically and accuracy increases when THOUGHTTERMINATOR is used. Considering that the token spend budgets are directly defined by LMs, THOUGHTTERMINATOR is a simple and effective tool to dramatically improve token efficiency in reasoning models.

- Figure 7: Calibration ablation experiment using DeepSeek-R1-1.5B. real-min represents using the previously observed minimum successful answer length (or, a fallback maximum for examples that were never solved correctly) as the THOUGHTTERMINATOR deadline. fix-{200,500,1000,2000} signify using the respective number as a fixed token count deadline for all samples. pred-diff-{gpt4o,ref,trained} refer to using question-level difficulty predictions as deadlines, produced from external LMs, a question-level reference difficulty key of token lengths from the other models, or trained RMs.

###### 5.1 Calibration of THOUGHTTERMINATOR

To evaluate how well-calibrated THOUGHTTERMINATOR is (i.e., whether the token budget selections are optimal) we compare our difficulty prediction-based deadline estimator against a set of baselines. In addition to our trained difficulty predictor and zero-shot gpt4o predictor, we use the previously observed optimal token spends from base models (section 2) and fixed deadlines of 500, 1000, and 2000 tokens with DeepSeek-r1-Qwen-1.5b to assess how performant our predicted deadlines are in the THOUGHTTERMINATOR framework. Figure 7 shows the performance of the model under those deadline prediction strategies.

Our method, pred-diff-trained, achieves optimal Pass@10 over the other methods on MATH500 and DUMB500, and is within 0.02% of optimal Pass@10 on ZebraLogic and GPQA, for significant savings in compute cost. Note how all four datasets exhibit a positive correlation between average token spend and Pass@10 which eventually reaches a steady maximum. Under our definition, overthinking mitigation can be thought of as identifying the lowest token spend that recovers high-spend performance. Figure 7 confirms that THOUGHTTERMINATOR achieves this.

###### 5.2 Utility of interrupt messages in THOUGHTTERMINATOR

Appendix Table 3 shows the difference in performance of r1-1.5B in an unmodified base condition, as well as under a na¨ıve baseline, and THOUGHTTERMINATOR with questionlevel randomly assigned deadlines and the core trained-predicted deadlines. In this na¨ıve baseline the reasoning model is immediately interrupted at the deadline, and without warning forced to generate an answer using the same constrained decoding technique.

r1-1.5B-THOUGHTTERMINATOR presents roughly equivalent performance to the na¨ıve baseline on the non-arithmetic GPQA and ZebraLogic datasets in Pass@10, and wins by 6% on MATH500 and 18% on DUMB500-math. This suggests that the intermediate interrupt messages produced by THOUGHTTERMINATOR do play a role in minimizing performance loss of decoding-based overthinking mitigation.

##### 6 Related Work

Mitigating overthinking. To shorten LLM reasoning chains, Deng et al. (2024) and Liu et al. (2024) propose to internalize intermediate steps by iteratively training the models, though this introduces additional training overhead. Dynasor is a technique for terminating chains of thought using the LM’s confidence in a probe containing the string “wait, I just realized I know the answer...” with constrained decoding (Fu et al., 2024). While our termination process can use a similar constrained decoding technique, THOUGHTTERMINATOR is not reliant on a white-box probe, and is much simpler to run. Chen et al. (2024) introduce metrics for overthinking and process efficiency, similar to us, but they focus on important heuristics such as “number of repetitions of the correct answer” or “ratio of correct to incorrect answer proposals”, while our analysis solely quanitifies overthinking based on the observed distribution of reasoning chain lengths.

Benchmarking reasoning models. A number of benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs), with a focus on challenging, multi-step problem-solving.(Cobbe et al., 2021; Srivastava et al., 2022; Hendrycks et al., 2021; Zhu et al., 2023; Lin et al., 2024). Several recent works on efficiency benchmarking of LMs have been proposed, including Mercury, an efficiency evaluation for code synthesis tasks (Du et al., 2024). GSM8k-Zero is an another dataset to evaluate efficiency of reasoning, which contains easy questions from GSM8K (Chiang & Lee, 2024).

##### 7 Conclusions

In this work we analyzed the problem of overthinking in reasoning models through an observational lens. Motivated by our observational measures of overthinking, we demonstrated a clear sample-wise relationship between token spend and question-level difficulty. We introduced the DUMB500 dataset to allow us to evaluate the robustness of any overthinking mitigation to simple questions and proposed THOUGHTTERMINATOR, a simple inference-time technique to ensuring efficient token spend, calibrated by the aforementioned difficulty-optimal spend relationship.

- • Exponents & Roots: Squaring and square roots
- • Unit Conversion: Basic metric conversions
- • Patterns & Sequences: Identifying missing numbers in sequences
- • Geometry: Recognizing shapes, angles, and basic geometric properties
- • Logical Reasoning: Basic problem-solving using logic

Conversational Interaction (Chats)

- • Self-reflective: Questions involving introspection and emotional states
- • Acknowledgment: Checking system responsiveness (e.g., ”Can you see this?”)
- • Greetings & Casual Chat: Common greetings and informal small talk
- • Commonsense Reasoning: Fundamental knowledge about the physical world (e.g., ”Is water wet?”)
- • Object Interaction: Simple cause-effect relationships (e.g., ”If I drop my phone, will it fall?”)
- • General Knowledge: Basic factual questions (e.g., ”What is the capital of China?”)

Programming & Computing (Code)
