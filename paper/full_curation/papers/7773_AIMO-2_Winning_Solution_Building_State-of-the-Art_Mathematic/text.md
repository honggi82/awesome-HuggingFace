##### Abstract:

This paper presents our winning submission to the AI Mathematical Olympiad - Progress Prize 2 (AIMO-2) competition. Our recipe for building state-of-the-art mathematical reasoning models relies on three key pillars. First, we create a large-scale dataset comprising 540K unique high-quality math problems, including olympiad-level problems, and their 3.2M long-reasoning solutions. Second, we develop a novel method to integrate code execution with long reasoning models through iterative training, generation, and quality filtering, resulting in 1.7M high-quality Tool-Integrated Reasoning solutions. Third, we create a pipeline to train models to select the most promising solution from many candidates. We show that such generative solution selection (GenSelect) can significantly improve upon majority voting baseline. Combining these ideas, we train a series of models that achieve state-of-the-art results on mathematical reasoning benchmarks. To facilitate further research, we release our code, models, and the complete OpenMathReasoning dataset under a commercially permissive license.

### 1. Introduction

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved their ability to solve complex reasoning tasks, including olympiad-level mathematics. A key idea behind this progress has been to allow models to spend more tokens thinking about the

solution before producing the final answer. Initially, models were trained to produce a series of intermediate solution steps (chain-of-thought (CoT) [35]). More recently, long reasoning models [12, 10] have learned to reflect on their work, exploring and refining multiple strategies within a single generation. This has led to further improvements across mathematics,

coding, and scientific domains. To keep pace with this rapid development, the community has introduced increasingly challenging benchmarks and competitions that help to evaluate the progress.

The AI Mathematical Olympiad - Progress Prize 2 (AIMO-2) is an initiative designed to assess advancements in this domain by challenging participants to create models capable of solving 50 difficult, nationallevel mathematical problems within strict computational limits. These problems were never published online, ensuring a more rigorous evaluation compared to traditional benchmarks. This report details our first-place submission to the competition, which correctly solved 34 out of 50 problems on the private test set. To develop the winning recipe, we focused on addressing several limitations of the publicly available reasoning models that we describe below.

Large-scale long-reasoning dataset (§2). To improve existing models we started by collecting an extensive set of mathematical problems from the internet. We developed an LLM-based problem extraction and refinement pipeline to construct a dataset of 540K unique problems. Using this dataset, we then generated 3.2M long-reasoning CoT solutions by prompting DeepSeek-R1 [10] and QwQ-32B [29]. Training Qwen2.5-Base models [39] on this large-scale distillation data, we are able to surpass the accuracy of all other open-weight models of comparable size, except for QwQ-32B, which is slightly better than our 32B model.

Tool-Integrated Reasoning (§3). To improve the results further we developed a method for integrating code execution into long-reasoning generations. Our initial attempts to elicit Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) from DeepSeek-R1 and QwQ-32B through simple prompting proved unsuccessful. We hypothesize that these models struggle to deviate from their standard solution format due to extensive training on reasoning tasks and limited exposure to instructionfollowing. To overcome this challenge, we built a pipeline that starts with a small-scale reasoning finetuning of an instruction-following model [42]. By prompting this model to generate long-reasoning TIR solutions followed by aggressive quality filtering, we established an initial dataset suitable for training. Through multiple iterations of training, generation, and filtering, we constructed a 1.7M TIR solution set that was crucial for improving the accuracy of our final models. To make TIR more efficient, we also developed a method to accurately control the number of code executions the model is allowed to make for each generation.

Generative Solution Selection (§4). A common approach to maximize model accuracy is to gen-

erate multiple candidate solutions and select the most promising one. While majority voting [34] serves as a strong baseline, its performance falls significantly short of the theoretical maximum performance of pass@k. To address this limitation, we developed a pipeline for training models to identify the most promising solution when presented with multiple candidates. We generated 566K selection examples to train our models. Although this approach showed considerable promise, we ultimately were unable to integrate it into our AIMO-2 Kaggle submission due to the competition’s strict time constraints.

Combining these three innovations, we developed a series of state-of-the-art open-weight math reasoning models with 1.5B, 7B, 14B, and 32B parameters. Each model supports CoT, TIR and GenSelect inference modes when appropriately prompted. For our winning AIMO-2 submission we used an intermediate version of the 14B model and implemented various inference optimizations to accommodate the competition’s time and compute constraints. We discuss model training process and evaluation results in Section 5 and list Kaggle-specific optimizations in Section 6.

To accelerate progress in open-source mathematical reasoning, we are releasing our code, finetuned OpenMath-Nemotron models, and the complete OpenMathReasoning dataset under a commercially permissive license.1

### 2. Data Preparation

In this section, we outline our validation and training data curation pipeline. Section 2.1 presents our methodology for preparing a large-scale problem set for training. Section 2.2 describes our validation set collection process. Finally, Section 2.3 details our approach to synthesizing long-reasoning Chainof-Thought (CoT) solutions.

##### 2.1. Problems preparation

We collect a large set of mathematical problems from the Art of Problem Solving (AoPS) community forums. We include all forum discussions except “Middle School Math”, which we found to be too elementary and unhelpful for training in our preliminary experiments. After retrieving forum discussions, we implement a systematic process to extract problems and their corresponding answers. Throughout our pipeline, we utilize Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct [39] for all processing steps unless specified otherwise.

1Data and models are available at https://huggingface.co/collections/nvidia/openmathreasoning68072c0154a5099573d2e730, our code is avaliable at https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Skills

- 1. Problem Extraction: We prompt an LLM to identify and extract all problems from the initial forum posts (Appendix A.7). While most posts contain a single problem, some include multiple problems or none at all.
- 2. Problem Classification: Each extracted problem is classified into the following categories. We use an LLM to perform the classification:

- • Proof problem or not (Appendix A.4)
- • Multiple choice question or not (Appendix A.3)
- • Binary question (yes-or-no answer) or not (Appendix A.1)
- • Valid problem or not (Appendix A.2)2

We remove all multiple-choice questions, binary questions, and invalid problems from the final dataset.

- 3. Question Transformation: For proof questions, we convert them into answer-based questions that require similar problem-solving techniques (Appendix A.5).
- 4. Answer Extraction: For non-proof questions, we attempt to extract the final answer from the forum discussions (Appendix A.6)3.
- 5. Benchmark Decontamination: Following [41] we use an LLM-based comparison to remove questions that closely resemble those in popular math benchmarks.

All prompts and scripts necessary to run the above pipeline are available in NeMo-Skills. Table 1 has a breakdown of the dataset size after each processing stage and Table 2 shows the final dataset composition. We provide a comparison with other popular datasets sourced from AoPS forums in Table 3.

gathered from the Art of Problem Solving forums. We restricted our selection to 2024 and 2025 competitions to minimize potential data contamination. AIME and HMMT problems were selected for our validation set due to their strong alignment with AIMO-2 competition requirements. They covered similar mathematical topics, matched the difficulty level, and were predominantly non-proof-based questions requiring single numerical answers. We excluded proof-based questions and those awarding partial credit based on estimate accuracy, as these are generally incompatible with an exact match evaluation framework. The resulting dataset, which we call Comp-Math-24-25, consists of 256 problems, as detailed in Table 4.

##### 2.3. Text-based Solution Synthesis

To generate CoT solutions, we follow a common pipeline of directly prompting an existing open-weight LLM to solve problems collected in Section 2.1. We utilize DeepSeek-R1 and QwQ-32B models and generate up to 32 solution candidates for each problem in our dataset. We use temperature 0.7, top-𝑝 = 0.95, and limit generations to 16384 tokens. We gener-

ate more solutions for harder problems with known answers, where the hardness was estimated by computing an average pass-rate across 32 generations from the Qwen2.5-72B-Math-Instruct model [40].

As the final filtering step we remove any solutions that do not reach the expected answer. Predicted and expected answers are compared by prompting Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct to judge whether they are equivalent in the context of the problem (we re-use judge prompt from [30]). For each problem where we weren’t able to extract the final answer (and for all converted proofs) we treat the most common answer across all available solution candidates as the groundtruth. Table 5 shows the final distribution of CoT solutions in our dataset.

### 3. Tool-Integrated Reasoning

Allowing LLMs to integrate natural language reasoning with Python code execution is a known way of improving accuracy on challenging math problems [31, 40]. However, the best open-weight reasoning models (most notably DeepSeek-R1 [10] and QwQ-32B [29]) are not able to directly produce such Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) solutions. Our initial attempts to induce TIR generations by prompting these reasoning models with direct instructions or fewshot examples turned out to be unsuccessful. Unable to solve this via prompting, we had to develop a more elaborate pipeline for building reasoning models capable of producing TIR solutions.

In our early experiments, we noticed that when non-reasoning instruct LLMs are trained on a limited quantity of reasoning data [42], they tend to retain their good instruction-following abilities. Building on this intuition, we were able to successfully prompt LIMO-Qwen-32B [42] model to produce TIR solutions, but found that they tend to be low-quality on average. The produced code was often irrelevant or was merely used to verify calculations of preceding CoT steps. To overcome this, we developed a filtering step aimed at retaining only high-quality examples where code execution provides substantial reasoning benefits. Using this filtered dataset, we then fine-tuned our

reasoning model, achieving significant performance improvements over the CoT-only predecessor. Finally, we employed an iterative model improvement approach by training a more powerful TIR model in each iteration and using it to generate and filter additional TIR examples, further enhancing model performance. In the following subsections, we detail each stage of this pipeline.

##### 3.1. Instruction-following reasoning model

Prior work [21, 42] shows that fine-tuning on as few as 1000 samples is sufficient to make LLM produce longCoT solutions. We hypothesize that an instruct model fine-tuned on such a small dataset can potentially preserve its instruction-following and long-reasoning capabilities.

To test this, we prompted LIMO-Qwen-32B to solve the problem using Python code for the steps that require complex calculations. The zero-shot prompt we designed for this purpose is provided in Appendix B.1. For roughly half of the problems, the model produced a solution that contained at least one Python code block. We then synthesized 1.2M solutions for OpenMathReasoning problems, using temperature=0.7, top-𝑝 = 0.95, allowing maximum sequence length of 16384 tokens and stopping generations if the solution contained more than 8 code executions.

##### 3.2. Filtering TIR data

Careful inspection of generated solutions revealed that code execution often does not benefit the solution and could easily be replaced with several simple CoT steps (see example in Appendix F.2). Instead, we want an ideal TIR solution to provide significant shortcuts by implementing otherwise infeasible brute-force approaches, e.g., using numeric solvers or conducting an exhaustive search of possible solutions. To filter unwanted code usages, we apply several filters. First, we utilize Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct to classify each code block by two criteria:

- • novel calculation / verification. Whether the code execution leads to a novel result or it simply verifies the previous steps (see the prompt in Appendix B.2).
- • significant / moderate / trivial. Whether the code implements an important part of the solution or is easily substitutable with several CoT steps (see the prompt in Appendix B.3).

We then only keep solutions that either have at least one novel and significant code block or more than half novel and moderate code blocks. Additionally, we

apply rule-based filtering and remove solutions with incorrect final answer and solutions without code execution. We also remove solutions with more than two code blocks, as we found it to be helpful in our preliminary experiments. As part of preprocessing, we also replace the tags marking the start and end of code blocks. During stage-0 generation, we instruct the model to place code between "‘‘‘python" and "‘‘‘\n", following a markdown-like style that models can easily produce; we then replace these with "<tool_call>" and "</tool_call>" tags, respectively, to make the code ending tag distinguishable from regular markdown and facilitate code extraction. All described filtering steps result in the TIR dataset, consisting of 15k samples, which we will refer to as stage-0 TIR data.

##### 3.3. Iterative data generation

For the next stage of TIR solution generation, we leverage QwQ-32B as it proved to be a powerful yet lightweight synthetic reasoning data generator. For this purpose, we fine-tune it on the stage-0 data

- for 7 epochs with a constant learning rate of 5e-6. We then synthesize solutions for OpenMathReasoning problems. We generate 700K samples and filter them down to 260K by removing incorrect solutions and solutions not using code. We find that novelty and significance filters degrade the performance at this stage, so we do not use them.

To further improve results, we repeat this process one more time using an intermediate version of our 14B model, which was finetuned on the CoT-only subset of OpenMathReasoning data. We train this 14B model on QwQ-32B solutions and then execute a final round of data generation and filtering, ultimately resulting in the final 1.7M TIR dataset.

##### 3.4. Controlling the number of code blocks

We developed a simple, yet effective method to control the number of code blocks that the model can use. During all data generation stages, we format the code output as shown in Appendix F.1, appending additional notification warning about how many code executions are remaining. We find that model often refers to this message in its thinking process, refraining from further code usage when the limit is reached. Thus, for each problem we randomly select between 1 and 8 allowed code executions and provide this information in the prompt. We remove generations that try to use more code blocks than requested in order to reinforce the correct behavior in training. As a result, model learns to follow specified code execution limit. An example of this behavior is provided in Appendix F.3.

### 4. Generative Solution Selection

We observe a considerable gap in the majority@k vs pass@k performance for our models, implying the models theoretical ability to solve far more problems than can be achieved with a majority answer. To bridge this gap, we explore training a model that, given a set of candidate solution summaries, picks the most promising solution. In our early experiments, we found that comparing multiple solutions yields significantly better results than judging each solution in isolation. Following [45], we do not change the model’s architecture and instead let it reason in natural language before selecting one of the provided solutions. We detail the pipeline to prepare the training data for such selection generations (GenSelect) in the following sections. The data construction pipeline of is shown in Figure 3.

##### 4.1. Creating New Summaries

Solutions generated by reasoning models have a thinking part and a summary which follows it. We noticed that summaries generated by reasoning models, such as DeepSeek-R1, could be very succinct; in extreme cases, they could just be stating the final answer. Since we require a representative summary for comparing different solutions during inference, we replace the native summary of the reasoning models by synthesizing new summaries with the Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct model. We synthesize four candidate summaries per solution with a maximum length of 2048 tokens. To ensure the summary is faithful, we filter out summaries where the predicted answer is different from the original solution’s predicted answer. If there are no valid summaries, we discard the sample4, otherwise we select the longest summary to replace the original summary. We regenerate summaries for the entire OpenMathReasoning dataset using this process, so that models trained on it can produce these summaries directly. See Appendix E for a comparison between one-word DeepSeek-R1 summary and a new one generated by Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct.

##### 4.2. Generating Selection Candidates

We discover that modest accuracy gains over majority voting can be achieved by simply presenting new solution summaries to reasoning models and prompting them to compare and select one (see prompt in Appendix C.3). Building on this observation, we develop the following pipeline to generate training data for this GenSelect inference.

For each problem in the OpenMathReasoning

- Figure 2: Comparison of majority, GenSelect and pass metrics for different number of generation samples. To construct the input for GenSelect, we use subsets of 16 solutions (or all if fewer samples were generated). For the final answer, we perform majority@8 over the answers selected by the GenSelect.

dataset, we randomly sample between 2 and 16 candidate solution summaries. We ensure that each sample group contains at least one correct and one incorrect solution. This process is repeated until we obtain 8 distinct comparison groups for each problem. Using the GenSelect prompt (Appendix C.3), we then task QwQ-32B with selecting the most promising solution from each group. This procedure generates 1M selections, which we subsequently filter down to 565K by eliminating any instances where incorrect solutions were chosen.

##### 4.3. Reducing computational cost

While this dataset is suitable for training, the comparison generations can be as long as the original solutions, making GenSelect inference computationally expensive. To address this challenge, we explored training models to directly generate the final comparison summary rather than learning the full reasoning trace. Consistent with our previous observations, the natural comparison summaries produced by QwQ-32B proved suboptimal. We therefore again used Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct to regenerate all comparison summaries (see the prompt in Appendix D.1) and trained our models using these summarized comparisons. Our early experiments revealed only a small reduction in accuracy (1–2%) compared to models trained on the whole reasoning traces. This final setup makes GenSelect inference remarkably efficient compared to the original long-reasoning generations. With output tokens capped at 2048, most computa-

tion occurs in a highly-parallelizable pre-filling phase. Since each solution summary is similarly limited to 2048 tokens, the total input context cannot exceed 32768 tokens when using the maximum of 16 solutions per problem. Although more than 16 solutions could theoretically be included in a prompt, we generally observe diminishing returns as the context becomes too large. For scenarios requiring evaluation of more solution candidates, we propose sampling 16 solutions multiple times and then performing majority voting to determine the final answer. Nevertheless, our findings indicate that the most significant accuracy improvements occur when GenSelect is applied to a smaller number of generations (Figure 2).

### 5. OpenMath-Nemotron models

In this section we present the training and evaluation details of our OpenMath-Nemotron series of models.

##### 5.1. Training

To build our final models we perform supervisedfinetuning (SFT) on a series of Qwen2.5-Base models (1.5B, 7B, 14B and 32B) [39]. For 1.5B and 7B models, we start from the special model versions finetuned for mathematical reasoning tasks [40]. Unlike general Qwen2.5 models, the math versions only support a limited context window of 4096 tokens, which is inadequate for the long-reasoning generations. To overcome this, we follow [2] and change RoPE [27] base to 500K.

- Figure 3: Data construction pipeline of GenSelect. The GenSelect input is constructed by sampling solution summaries of both correct and incorrect instances, ensuring that the input contains at least one correct and one incorrect solution. The input is then fed to QwQ-32B, which is tasked with selecting the best solution among the candidate solutions. The reasoning traces that select correct solutions are summarized with Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct, which forms the GenSelect output.

All models are trained for six epochs on a combination of three tasks: CoT solution generation, TIR solution generation, and GenSelect, where the task is to select one correct solution out of multiple candidates. Each task is defined by a unique prompt that we can use at inference time to switch between different generation modes (see prompts in Appendix C). We found that training on a mix of all tasks results in a similar accuracy compared to training on each task sequentially (first CoT, then TIR, then GenSelect). The total SFT dataset size is 5.5M samples (3.2M CoT, 1.7M TIR, and 566K GenSelect).

We train all models using AdamW optimizer [18] with weight decay of 0.01 and a cosine learning rate decay schedule with a 10% linear warmup. We use a starting learning rate of 3e-4 for 1.5B, 2e-4 for 7B and 1e-4 for 14B and 32B models. The final learning

rate is set to be 1000 times smaller. We use batch size of 1024 samples and leverage sequence packing and context parallelization techniques from NeMoAligner [26] that significantly accelerate training on the long-reasoning data. Following [30] we save 4 equally spaced checkpoints during the training runs, which are averaged to create the final model. We show the accuracy on the Comp-Math-24-25 benchmark (Section 2.2) of intermediate 1.5B and 14B model checkpoints in Figure 4.

After the first round of training, we perform another SFT on a subset of harder problems. These problems are selected only from forums discussing Olympiad math and we discard any problems for which Qwen2.5-Math-72B-Instruct TIR model has a pass-rate bigger than 0.3 out of 32 generations. Additionally, we filter any solutions that have fewer than 5000 tokens. The total SFT data size of this harder set is 2.2M samples. We follow the same setup as for the first round of SFT except we train for 4 epochs instead of 6. We do this second round of training for all models except 32B as we found some degradation in results. Models’ accuracy after the first and second round of training is presented in Table 6. We find that CoT results tend to significantly improve while TIR results stay stable or slightly degrade.

Final evaluation results of our models are presented in Table 7. In addition to Comp-Math-24-25, introduced in Section 2.2, we use Humanity’s Last Exam dataset [6]. We only evaluate on a subset consisting of 975 text-only problems from “Math” category. We refer to it as HLE-Math.

We notice that despite being superior in majority@𝑘 setting with TIR prompt, smaller models perform on par or even worse in pass@1, compared to CoT prompt. The results in Table 8 suggest that the

reason is that with the TIR prompt there are more unfinished solutions across all model sizes, with 1.5B clearly standing out. We hypothesize that the reason behind this is that smaller models are less consistent in using tools effectively.

### 6. Kaggle submission

In this section, we present the details of our winning submission to the AI Mathematical Olympiad Progress Prize 2 (AIMO-2) [7]. AIMO-2 is a competition organized by the AIMO Prize team and hosted on Kaggle 5. The competition featured 110 challenging math problems: 10 were made publicly available as a reference subset, while the remaining problems were split between the public and private leaderboards. Submitted solutions were evaluated under strict computational constraints: a 5-hour time limit in an offline Jupyter notebook environment powered by four L4 GPUs. Our 1st-place submission correctly solved 34 out of 50 questions on the private leaderboard.

##### 6.1. Training recipe

For our winning Kaggle submission we used a somewhat different training recipe that we detail in this section. We first trained Qwen2.5-14B-Base model

- for 8 epochs on a 2.2M subset of CoT solutions, excluding any converted proof problems. We only used DeepSeek-R1 solutions for this training. This is followed by a light-weight fine-tuning on 15k stage-0 TIR samples. The process for collecting these samples is detailed in section 3.2. We train TIR model for

5https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/ai-mathematicalolympiad-progress-prize-2

400 steps with a constant learning rate of 1e-5 and use the last checkpoint without averaging. We then merge CoT and TIR checkpoints as it both improves accuracy and speeds up generation by reducing solution length and number of code executions. We did not use GenSelect training or inference for the Kaggle submission.

##### 6.2. Model Merging

In this competition, we explored various methods for merging two LLMs with CoT and TIR behaviors. Our primary goal was to effectively combine the distinct strengths of these two fine-tuning stages to enhance model performance. We experimented with several merging techniques from mergekit [9] package. Surprisingly, the most effective approach turned out to be a simple linear combination of the two checkpoints: the CoT checkpoint used before TIR fine-tuning and the best TIR checkpoint attained thereafter. This strategy allowed us to control the extent to which each stage influenced the final model’s behavior. Table 10 provides the accuracy, as well as the generation length and code usage statistics of the models before and after the described merging procedure.

##### 6.3. Inference Optimizations

The strict time limits of the competition presented a serious constraint. An extra requirement was that problems had to be answered one-at-a-time making it harder to parallelize computation and allocate time. To overcome these challenges we implemented several optimizations that maximize inference efficiency while maintaining output quality.

We present metrics as pass@1 (maj@64) where pass@1 is an average accuracy across 64 generations and maj@64 is the result of majority voting. The 14B model used in our kaggle submission is denoted as (kaggle). For HMMT and HLE-Math benchmarks we use LLM-judge setup of [30] to verify the answers. To construct the input for GenSelect, we use subsets of 16 solutions from the set of 64 solutions. We repeat this 64 times and perform majority voting over the answers selected by the GenSelect.

##### 6.3.1. TensorRT-LLM Optimization

Pretrained models were converted to TensorRT engines using TensorRT-LLM [23]. TensorRT-LLM’s in-flight batching boosts throughput by dynamically grouping inference requests, releasing each sample as soon as it completes—reducing latency and optimizing GPU utilization. Since samples are processed independently, batches can mix different prompts or inference parameters seamlessly. TensorRT-LLM includes a number of other optimizations such as custom attention kernels and paged KV caching.

Quantization involves a speed-accuracy tradeoff, as outlined in TensorRT-LLM’s best practices [24]. We prioritized int8 weight-only (W8A16) and FP8 quantization, which delivered faster inference than BF16 with minimal accuracy loss. The reduced weight

size also freed up memory for larger key-value caches.

##### 6.3.2. Speculative Decoding

To accelerate inference, we employ ReDrafter [4], a recurrent speculative decoding technique that uses an RNN-based drafter to propose and verify multiple tokens per decoding step. We trained a drafter capable of proposing up to three tokens at each step, with all three tokens being accepted in approximately 65% of the steps.

For training ReDrafter, we sampled a random subset of 100k problems from the OpenMathReasoning dataset. With the target model, we generated one solution per problem, leveraging the resulting data to train the drafter.

Table 9 presents an evaluation of various quantiza-

tion techniques and the speculative decoding method, analyzing their impact on both the inference speed and the accuracy.

We experimented with various sampling parameters but observed minimal differences in the results. We thus based our winning submission on an almost greedy search strategy by setting temperature to 0 and enabling the redrafter_greedy_search parameter. Despite these settings TensorRT-LLM still produced varying outputs within a single batch of identical prompts. We did not investigate this behavior in detail, but we suspect that it could be related to an accumulation of small numerical errors which cause a few tokens to be different early on in the generation. This difference then accumulates over many tokens resulting in a substantially diverse solution set at the end. Ultimately, we chose this approach because it provided more stable results at small batch sizes and offered a small improvement in the speed of speculative decoding.

##### 6.3.4. Time Management

A buffering strategy was implemented, allocating 350 seconds per question as the base time limit. If a question completed early, the unused time was added to a shared buffer. The next question could then draw up to 210 extra seconds from this buffer, allowing a maximum of 560 seconds when combined with its base allocation.

##### 6.3.3. Model Serving

Models were served via a FastAPI backend powered by Nemo-Skills [22], which supports time-constrained generation. This allowed us to dynamically limit response times per question—if an answer wasn’t completed within the window, we returned early to check for extractable results.

Nemo-Skills’ async generation enabled batched processing with early stopping. For example, in a batch of 16, if the first 4-5 completions agreed on the final answer, we canceled the remaining generations and proceeded to the next question. We also mitigated stragglers—samples that ran significantly longer than others—by canceling the last 𝑛 pending requests once the rest finished. This early stopping increased response relevance as shorter answers tended to be higher quality.

##### 6.3.5. Code Execution Integration

For tool-calling capabilities, we used Nemo-Skills’s code execution wrapper to enable tool-integrated reasoning. A Flask-based sandbox environment handles parallelized Python execution for each inference thread, processing LLM-generated code blocks with strict safeguards:

- • Maximum 6 code calls per generation cycle
- • 2 second timeout for each code execution
- • Only the first 200 characters of the code output were shown back to the LLM

The system feeds back either execution results or error traces into the generation process, enabling iterative reasoning while maintaining computational efficiency.

##### 6.4. Discussion

Our Kaggle submission is based on an early development version of the final OpenMath-Nemotron-14B model. This model was trained on a smaller dataset, did not have GenSelect capability, and could not switch between CoT and TIR modes by changing the prompt. While we did have a much better checkpoint towards the end of the competition, we were ultimately unable to make a high-scoring submission with it. In this section, we explore several potential explanations for why this happened.

High variance in scores. The competition rules allow only a single submission per day. Since the public leaderboard consists of only 50 problems presented in random order, we observed substantial variance across our submissions. This made it hard to make quick decisions on which directions to prioritize, especially in cases when our local evaluations disagreed with the leaderboard scores.

Focus on smaller models. As shown in Table 7 OpenMath-Nemotron-7B model performs comparably or better than the 14B model used in Kaggle. Observing this towards the end of the competition, we tried to prioritize submissions with the smaller model, allowing it more generations, and also increased the maximum generation length. Yet we were unable to see comparable leaderboard scores. This discrepancy suggests that either our local evaluation set differs substantially from what was used in Kaggle, or that the smaller models struggle with a few particularly challenging problems—a limitation difficult to detect through aggregate benchmark scores alone.

Longer average generations. Our local evaluations always had a fixed token budget for each generation. However, the time management logic implemented in Kaggle (Section 6.3.4) heavily relied on solving easy problems quickly to allocate more time for challenging ones. Interestingly, we discovered that although our final models achieved superior scores within the same token budget, they produced around 10% more tokens on average. Not realizing this early enough, we were unable to fix this undesirable feature before the end of the competition.

### 7. Related Work

##### 7.1. Tool Integration Reasoning

Tool-augmented approaches to mathematical problem solving have advanced rapidly in recent years. A seminal contribution by Chen et al. [3] introduced the Program of Thoughts (PoT) framework, which integrates natural language with executable code to support

step-by-step reasoning through a hybrid of textual and programmatic logic. Building on this foundation, subsequent research has focused on developing both datasets and models that facilitate tool-integrated reasoning.

On the data side, OpenMathInstruct-1 [31] offers 1.8 million instruction-tuning examples derived from code interpreters across benchmarks such as GSM8K and MATH. Similarly, InfinityMATH [44] introduces 100K instances of programmatic reasoning, while MARIO [16] combines model reasoning with tool outputs, accompanied by a dataset constructed from GSM8K [5] and MATH [11]. These resources have significantly enriched the training landscape for toolaugmented reasoning systems.

On the modeling side, Qwen2.5 [40] introduced a series of models with strong mathematical reasoning capabilities, supporting advanced techniques like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR). Gao et al. [8] proposed a two-stage method: training large language models to generate reasoning chains, and then invoking domain-specific tools to execute each step by injecting the necessary knowledge. Xiong et al. [38] proposed a multi-turn, online, iterative direct preference learning framework tailored to this unique context. By incorporating feedback from code interpreters during the training process, their approach achieves significant performance improvements on the MATH benchmark. Wu et al. [36] dynamically integrate web search, code execution, and structured reasoning with contextual memory to tackle complex problems that demand deep research and multistep logical deduction. Li et al. [15] developed a ToolIntegrated Reinforcement Learning framework that autonomously utilizes computational tools by scaling reinforcement learning directly from base models, and demonstrate substantial improvements compared to RL without tools.

##### 7.2. Generative Reward Models

Conventional reward models and verifiers are often trained as discriminative binary classifiers, underutilizing the generative strengths of large language models (LLMs). To address this, Generative Reward Models (GenRM) [19], introduced by Mahan et al., reformulate verification as a generation task—using the log probabilities of tokens like “Yes” or “No” to represent correctness. This framing allows GenRM to better exploit LLMs’ natural language generation capabilities, leading to improved alignment with human judgments across both in-distribution and out-ofdistribution tasks. Concurrently, Zhang et al. [45] introduced Generative Verifiers, training CoT-GenRM with a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) objective to serve

as a verifier for mathematical reasoning. Building on a similar motivation, Ankner et al. [1] combined Chainof-Thought (CoT) reasoning generation with BradleyTerry reward modeling, enabling reward models to explicitly reason about response quality before assigning scores. Extending this line of work, Wang et al. [33] proposed self-taught evaluators, jointly training generative models and LLM-as-a-Judge frameworks to produce both intermediate reasoning traces and final judgments. In related approaches, Wang et al. [32] trained large language models as generative judges by leveraging Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) on both positive and negative data, demonstrating improved evaluation performance across diverse tasks. Wu et al. [37] introduced a Meta-Rewarding step in the self-improvement process, enabling the model to evaluate its own judgments and use the feedback to refine its evaluation capabilities.

##### 7.3. Math Reasoning Datasets

In the pursuit of improving mathematical reasoning in large language models, researchers have recently introduced several large-scale, high-quality datasets. Skywork-MathQA [43] stands out with its 2.5 million question-answer pairs, generated using a trio of augmentation methods and built upon a varied set of foundational problems. Complementing this, NuminaMath [13] offers 860K challenging competition-style math problems, each carefully annotated with step-bystep reasoning chains [34], enabling more interpretable and structured model outputs.

More recent work has focused on advancing the complexity and depth of reasoning. New datasets have emerged that emphasize challenging questions paired with rich, multi-step reasoning traces, pushing models to handle more sophisticated mathematical thought processes. BackMATH was introduced in [46], a novel dataset centered on backward reasoning. It contains approximately 14K problems specifically designed to support backward problem-solving, along with 100K detailed reasoning steps that trace the reverse logical flow from solution to problem. The OpenR1 team released OpenR1-Math-220K [25], a large-scale dataset for mathematical reasoning comprising 220K math problems. Each problem includes two to four reasoning traces generated by DeepSeek R1, based on problems from NuminaMath 1.5 [14]. In addition, Zhao et al. [47] presented AM-DeepSeek-R1-Distilled, a largescale dataset featuring 1.4 million question-response pairs with associated thinking traces for general reasoning tasks. This dataset is composed of high-quality, challenging problems aimed at advancing reasoning capabilities. Following a similar direction, Liu et al. [17] introduced a Chinese version of the DeepSeek-R1

distilled dataset, consisting of 110K question-solution pairs. The DolphinR1 team [28] released a dataset of 800K samples, combining outputs from various reasoning models, including DeepSeek-R1, Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking, and Dolphin Chat.

##### Problem

Call a 9-digit number a cassowary if it uses each of the digits 1 through 9 exactly once. Compute the number of cassowaries that are prime.

##### Deepseek R1 Response

<think> Okay, so I need to figure out how many 9-digit numbers, which use each digit from 1 to 9 exactly once, are prime. These numbers are called cassowaries. Hmm, let’s start by understanding the problem step by step. First, a cassowary is a 9-digit pandigital number, meaning it uses each digit 1 through 9 once. So, numbers like 123456789, but any permutation of those digits. The question is asking how many of these are prime numbers. Alright, so the main task is to compute the count of prime numbers among all 9-digit pandigitals. Let me think about the properties of prime numbers and pandigital numbers. First, let’s recall that a prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. For a number to be prime, it can’t be even (except for 2), and it can’t end with 5. Also, there are some divisibility rules that might help here. Since we’re dealing with 9-digit numbers using all digits 1-9, let’s check the sum of the digits. The digits are 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9 = 45. Wait, 45 is divisible by 9, right? So any number made with all these digits will have a digit sum of 45, which is divisible by 9. Therefore, any such number is divisible by 9. But if a number is divisible by 9, it can’t be prime unless the number itself is 9, which it’s not here because we’re dealing with 9-digit numbers. So, does this mean that all cassowaries are divisible by 9 and hence composite? If that’s the case, then there are zero prime cassowaries. But let me verify this again. The divisibility rule for 9 is that if the sum of the digits is divisible by 9, then the number itself is divisible by 9. Since 45 is divisible by 9, every permutation of the digits 1-9 will result in a number divisible by 9. Therefore, all cassowaries are divisible by 9, which means they can’t be prime. So the answer should be zero. Wait, but let me make sure I’m not missing something. For example, could the number 9 itself be considered? But the problem specifies a 9-digit number, so 9 is a single-digit number. So all cassowaries are 9-digit numbers, which are divisible by 9, hence composite. Therefore, there are no primes in the set of cassowaries. So the answer is 0. But just to be thorough, let me check if there’s any exception. For example, is 9 a prime? No, 9 is 3 squared. So even if there was a 1-digit cassowary (which there isn’t, since cassowary is defined as 9-digit), it’s not prime. So, yeah, all 9-digit pandigitals using 1-9 are divisible by 9, hence composite. Therefore, the number of prime cassowaries is zero. </think>

##### Qwen2.5-32b-instruct Solution Summary

To determine the number of 9-digit prime numbers (cassowaries) that use each digit from 1 to 9 exactly once, we need to analyze the properties of these numbers.

- 1. **Sum of the Digits**: The sum of the digits from 1 to 9 is: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 45.
- 2. **Divisibility by 9**: A number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9. Since the sum of the digits is 45, which is divisible by 9, every 9-digit number formed using the digits 1 through 9 will be divisible by 9.
- 3. **Prime Numbers and Divisibility**: A prime number has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. Since any 9-digit number formed using the digits 1 through 9 is divisible by 9, it cannot be a prime number (except for the number 9 itself, which is not a 9-digit number).
- 4. **Conclusion**: Therefore, no 9-digit number that uses each digit from 1 to 9 exactly once can be a prime number. Thus, the number of prime cassowaries is:
