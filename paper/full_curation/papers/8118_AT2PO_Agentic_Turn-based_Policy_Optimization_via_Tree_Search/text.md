LLM agents have emerged as powerful systems for tackling multi-turn tasks by interleaving internal reasoning and external tool interactions. Agentic Reinforcement Learning has recently drawn significant research attention as a critical post-training paradigm to further refine these capabilities. In this paper, we present AT2PO (Agentic Turn-based Policy Optimization via Tree Search), a unified framework for multi-turn agentic RL that addresses three core challenges: limited exploration diversity, sparse credit assignment, and misaligned policy optimization. AT2PO introduces a turn-level tree structure that jointly enables Entropy-Guided Tree Expansion for strategic exploration and Turn-wise Credit Assignment for fine-grained reward propagation from sparse outcomes. Complementing this, we propose Agentic Turn-based Policy Optimization, a turn-level learning objective that aligns policy updates with the natural decision granularity of agentic interactions. ATPO is orthogonal to tree search and can be readily integrated into any multi-turn RL pipeline. Experiments across seven benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements over the state-of-the-art baseline by up to 1.84 percentage points in average, with ablation studies validating the effectiveness of each component. Our code is available at https://github.com/zzfoutofspace/ATPO.

by recent progress in RL with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) which leverages programmatic feedback to guide training (Guo et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2025c; Wen et al., 2025; Lambert et al., 2025), Agentic RL extends this paradigm to interactive, multi-turn scenarios. In this context, agents act through turns of interleaved thinking and tool use, with tool responses forming the subsequent observations, creating a structured, turn-based interaction that requires specialized algorithmic designs. This emerging paradigm of agentic RL has drawn significant attention in the research community (Jin et al., 2025; Wu et al., 2025a; Dong et al., 2025a; Feng et al., 2025; Yan et al., 2025).

Despite its promise, Agentic RL still faces three fundamental challenges that hinder effective policy learning. First, agents struggle to generate highquality, diverse trajectories under limited rollout budgets. Existing frameworks typically rely on chain-based generation or tree-based rollouts that expand nodes using random or heuristic criteria. These methods fail to strategically prioritize the exploration of high-uncertainty or high-potential turns, thereby limiting trajectory diversity and quality. Second, learning signals in multi-turn trajectories are inherently sparse. Rewards are typically

### 1 Introduction

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have catalyzed the development of autonomous agents capable of executing complex, multi-turn tasks through structured reasoning and tool use (Yao et al., 2023b; Schick et al., 2023; Shen et al., 2024). Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a natural framework for refining these agents by optimizing behavior toward task-level success. Inspired

available only at the end of a complete trajectory, making it difficult to attribute credit to specific intermediate action steps. Most critically, there remains a fundamental misalignment between the turn-based structure of agentic tasks and the flat optimization objectives used in current policy learning methods. Current policy optimization algorithms inherited from RLVR treat the agent’s output as a flat token sequence by simply masking out the tool response tokens, and apply either tokenlevel (Shao et al., 2024) or sequence-level (Zheng et al., 2025) importance sampling ratios. However, both schemes overlook a key structural property: the trajectory is generated through interleaved turns of agent reasoning and tool invocation, with new tool-generated tokens dynamically inserted between segments, as illustrated in Figure 1. Consequently, neither token-level nor sequence-level importance weighting properly accounts for the turn-wise sampling process. Moreover, even when step-wise learning signals are available, the unit of optimization mismatched with the natural unit of turn-level supervision. This structural mismatch prevents existing methods from capturing the stepwise logic of multi-turn decision-making, leading to unstable gradients and inefficient learning.

To overcome these challenges, we propose AT2PO (Agentic Turn-based Policy Optimization via Tree Search), a unified framework that integrates three synergistic components tailored to multi-turn agentic RL. 1) In the rollout phase, we introduce Entropy-Guided Tree Expansion, which adaptively grows the search tree from the most uncertain turns to maximize exploration efficiency. 2) In the rewarding phase, we develop a Turnwise Credit Assignment mechanism that propagates sparse outcome rewards backward through the tree to compute fine-grained, per-turn value and advantage estimates. It enables precise credit allocation without auxiliary supervision. 3) In the training phase, we design Agentic Turn-based Policy Optimization (ATPO), a novel policy learning algorithm that operates its importance sampling and clipping at the turn level, aligning the optimization objective with the structured turn-based decision process and significantly improving training stability and performance. Together, these components enable AT2PO to generate more diverse and high-quality rollouts, leverage sparse rewards more effectively, and optimize policies in a manner faithful to the multi-turn agentic paradigm. In conclusion, our contributions are summarized as follows:

- • We propose a unified tree-based approach that jointly leverages Entropy-Guided Tree Expansion for strategic exploration and Turn-wise Credit Assignment for fine-grained reward propagation. The turn-level tree maximizes exploration diversity and supervision quality from sparse outcome rewards.
- • We propose Agentic Turn-based Policy Optimization (ATPO), a turn-level policy update mechanism that is orthogonal to the treesearch framework and can be readily integrated into any multi-turn agentic RL pipeline. By operating at the natural granularity of multi-turn interactions, ATPO improves optimization stability and alignment compared to token-level or sequence-level baselines.
- • Through extensive experiments on search agent benchmarks, we demonstrate that AT2PO consistently outperforms prior strong baselines, yielding gains of up to 1.84 percentage points in average over the state-of-the-art baseline across seven benchmarks. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of each component above.

#### 2.1 Reinforcement Learning for LLMs

RL has become a key approach for aligning LLMs with complex objectives and improving reasoning capabilities (Yu et al., 2025b; Zheng et al., 2025; Jin et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2025d). Traditional RLHF pipelines rely on Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) (Schulman et al., 2017) with a learned reward model and value critic (Christiano et al., 2017; Stiennon et al., 2020). More recently, methods like RLVR leverage verifiable, programmatic rewards, demonstrating strong performance in settings with deterministic feedback (Guo et al., 2025). To simplify the architecture and reduce variance, a line of work replaces the critic with group-based baselines. GRPO (Guo et al., 2025) computes relative advantages within response groups, achieving strong results on long-form reasoning. DAPO (Yu et al., 2025b) improves scalability through decoupled clipping and dynamic sampling, while GSPO (Zheng et al., 2025) shifts clipping from the token to the sequence level for enhanced stability. Concurrent efforts further stabilize training via adaptive clipping strategies in the policy objec-

tive (Chen et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2025b; Su et al., 2025b; Gao et al., 2025).

However, existing methods treat rollouts as flat sequences and do not explicitly account for the multi-turn nature of agentic interactions. In contrast, ATPO formulates the learning objective at the turn level, aligning policy updates with turn-wise feedback to improve training stability and quality.

#### 2.2 Agentic Reinforcement Learning

Recent studies on Agentic RL focus primarily on trajectory data (Wu et al., 2025a; Li et al., 2025), algorithmic optimization (Dong et al., 2025b,a; Feng et al., 2025), memory management (Yan et al., 2025; Yu et al., 2025a), as well as multimodality (Geng et al., 2025; Wu et al., 2025b) and efficiency (Wang et al., 2025a). Algorithmically, several works focus on structured exploration. SearchR1 (Jin et al., 2025) integrates search tools into RL training, establishing a paradigm for knowledgeaugmented agents. ARPO (Dong et al., 2025b) branches rollouts at high-entropy tokens to encourage exploration, while AEPO (Dong et al., 2025a) limits over-branching via entropy-aware clipping. GiGPO (Feng et al., 2025) introduces multi-granularity advantage estimation for finer credit assignment. Most closely related, TreeGRPO (Ji et al., 2025) organizes rollouts into trees and computes group-relative advantages both within and across branches, extending GRPO to

agentic settings.

Even though methods like Tree-GRPO proposed to adopt a tree structure for more efficient rollout and trajectory collection, they do not explicitly prioritize expansion. In contrast, our entropy-guided tree expansion actively selects high-entropy nodes for branching, maximizing exploration efficiency. Coupled with ATPO our approach ensures coherent, diverse, and high-quality agentic behavior.

### 3 Preliminaries

An agentic framework interacts with external tools over multiple steps, which we model as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). At each time step t, the agent observes a state st and selects an action at, resulting in a transition to the next state st+1.

Following the widely adopted ReAct paradigm (Yao et al., 2023b), each action at comprises two components, including an internal chain-of-thought reasoning step and an executable operation. This operation is either a request to invoke an external tool or a final answer returned to terminate the interaction. Given a question in the input prompt, the agent iteratively samples actions at ∼ πθ(·|st) according to its current policy πθ, continuing until it emits the final answer at step T − 1. The resulting interaction trajectory is thus represented as τ = {(st,at)}Tt=0−1.

We assign a trajectory-level reward R(τ) based on the outcome, and aim to maximize the expected

return as follows:

J(πθ) = Eτ∼πθ[R(τ)], (1)

Optimization is typically performed via policy gradient methods. In contrast to actor-critic approaches such as PPO (Schulman et al., 2017), our method follows group-based optimization (Guo et al., 2025), which leverages group-wise candidate sampling to implicitly estimate advantages without requiring an additional critic network.

### 4 Methods

In this section, we detail the methodology of AT2PO, which introduces specific enhancements across the rollout, rewarding, and training phases. First, during the rollout phase, AT2PO adopts a treebased structure incorporating Entropy Guided Tree Expansion to enhance exploration diversity within a fixed inference budget. Second, in the rewarding phase, we leverage this tree topology to implement turn-wise credit assignment, enabling fine-grained supervision derived solely from outcome rewards. Finally, in the training phase, we design the turnbased policy optimization tailored for multi-turn agentic RL to enhance training stability and quality.

#### 4.1 Entropy Guided Tree Expansion

During the rollout phase, tree-search strategies have demonstrated strong effectiveness in online agentic RL (Ji et al., 2025). In contrast to conventional RLVR settings where tree nodes correspond to specially selected individual tokens (Hou et al., 2025), multi-turn agentic tasks naturally lend themselves to a turn-level formulation. Each observation–action pair constitutes a single tree node. This clear contextual segmentation facilitates diverse action sampling (including reasoning steps and tool-use requests) from well-structured intermediate states.

Rather than relying on random or heuristic expansion strategies as in prior work (e.g., TreeGRPO (Ji et al., 2025)), we propose EntropyGuided Tree Expansion, which iteratively expands the search tree from the most uncertain turns to promote diverse exploration. The full tree construction procedure is summarized in Algorithm 1.

Phase 1: Initialization. For each prompt xi ∈ P in the training batch, we first generate M independent chain-based trajectories using the current policy πθ. Each prompt xi is associated with its own tree Ti initialized by adding these M trajectories as branches. All branches are rooted at a shared

Ensure: Tree structures T = {T1,T2,...,T|P|}

- // Phase 1: Initialize Trees

- 1: for each prompt xi ∈ P do
- 2: Initialize root node ni with state si,0 = xi
- 3: for m = 1 to M do
- 4: τm ← RolloutFrom(si,0;πθ)
- 5: Add all nodes (si,j,ai,j) from τm to Ti
- 6: end for
- 7: end for

// Phase 2: Node Sampling & Tree Expansion

- 8: for l = 1 to L do
- 9: for each tree Ti do
- 10: C ← get_non_leaf_nodes(Ti)
- 11: s(n) = Hπθ(n)−α|children(n.parent)|
- 12: S ← TopK(C,K,s)
- 13: for each selected node (si,j,ai,j) ∈ S do
- 14: τ′ ← RolloutFrom(si,j;πθ)
- 15: Add all nodes (s′i,j,a′i,j) from τ′ to tree Ti as new branch

- 18: end for
- 19: return T

root node ni storing the initial state si,0 = xi. All non-root nodes contain both the intermediate state and the corresponding action, i.e., the incremental rollout segment generated at that turn.

Phase 2.1: Sampling. We compute the policy entropy at each node to quantify decision uncertainty. Higher entropy indicates greater ambiguity in action selection, highlighting nodes that would benefit most from further exploration. Specifically, we use Monte-Carlo estimation to estimate the normalized entropy Hπθ(n) of each node n:

Hπθ(n) =Ey∼πθ(·|x)[−logπθ(yk|x,y<k)] ≈

1 |yk|

−logπθ(yt|x,y<k) (2)

yt∈yk

where yk denotes the rollout segment generated in the k-th turn in a trajectory and stored at node n. We use the superscript yk to indicate the subsequence corresponding to a single turn, and the subscript yt to refer to the individual tokens within that subsequence.

Based on these entropy estimates, we select the

top K highest-entropy nodes in each tree and fork their states si,j to initiate new branches. To encourage balanced exploration across the tree and prevent over-expansion from a single node, we introduce a branching penalty coefficient α that downweights repeatedly selected nodes.

Phase 2.2: Expansion. From each forked state si,j, we regenerate the remainder of the trajectory using the full context from the root to the fork point. The resulting continuation is appended as a new branch to the original tree.

We repeat Phase 2.1 and 2.2 for L iterations yielding a total of M + LK leaf nodes per prompt. As the expected depth of the sampled nodes for expansion is half of the maximum length, given that the average token budget of an individual rollout as B, the total token budget for one search tree is (M + LK/2)B. Thus the tree-based approach generates a larger number of diverse rollouts under the same computational budget, enhancing both exploration efficiency and training signal quality.

#### 4.2 Turn-wise Credit Assignment

During the rewarding stage, most existing RLVR algorithms solely relies on the final outcome reward (Shao et al., 2024) as ground-truth verification is typically only feasible upon completion of the full response. This sparse credit assignment obscures the contribution of individual actions to final outcomes, yielding weak or delayed learning signals that impede effective credit propagation in multi-turn agentic tasks.

Leveraging the search tree constructed during rollout, AT2PO enables fine-grained, turn-wise credit assignment. Specifically, we estimate the value Vn of each node n via Monte Carlo bootstrapping over its descendants,

r ˆn, if n is leaf

Vn =

c∈C(n) wcVc, otherwise, wc =

(3)

Hπθ(c) c′∈C(n) Hπθ(c′)

,

where C(n) denotes the set of child nodes of n, and rˆn = rn−stdmean{r {rn}

n} is the normalized final outcome reward assigned via standard GRPO normalization only at leaves. This recursive aggregation effectively propagates the outcome-based rewards backward through the tree to each intermediate node.

Based on the node values, we compute turn-wise advantages An = f(Vn) to serve as credit signals for policy updates, and assign them to all tokens

within. Several f(·) strategies are viable, including treating Vn directly as advantages, or other formulations proposed (Hou et al., 2025). We evaluate the effectiveness of different credit assignment schemes in Section 5.3.2.

#### 4.3 Agentic Turn-based Policy Optimization

During training, we observe that existing agentic RL frameworks typically adopt optimization algorithms originally designed for conventional RLVR settings, such as GRPO in Tree-GRPO and GPPO (Su et al., 2025a) in AEPO. These methods treat the entire interaction as a monolithic sequence and apply standard policy gradients, without accounting for the unique structure of multi-turn agentic interactions.

Motivated by the success of recent sequencelevel policy optimization methods like GSPO, which adjusts the learning objective into the sequence level to align with the final outcome reward, we propose Agentic Turn-Based Policy Optimization (ATPO) to better address the multi-turn nature of agentic tasks. Building on the fine-grained, turn-wise credit assignments derived from previous designs, we reformulate the policy optimization objective at the turn level for better alignment. Specifically, we introduce turn-wise importance sampling ratios and clipping mechanisms that operate per decision turn, enabling more precise and stable policy updates. This turn-aware formulation ensures that each reasoning or action step is (a) assigned importance ratios in a turn-consecutive manner and (b) optimized using its own turn-level learning signal.

where the individual token yi,t belongs to the turn yik(t), and sg(·) indicates the stop gradient operation. Mi,t is a masking scheme that includes only

tokens generated by the inference engine, excluding those originating from tool responses.

The effectiveness of ATPO stems from its balanced design that bridges the gap between tokenlevel and sequence-level policy optimization. First, in contrast to token-level methods such as GRPO, which suffer from high-variance of individual importance sampling ratios, ATPO operates at the turn level, significantly reducing clipped tokens and improving training stability. Second, unlike GSPO which facilitates its optimization objective and reward both on the coarse sequence-level, ATPO ensures that the optimization objective remains locally aligned with each consecutive turn-wise sampling step and with the fine-grained supervision provided by turn-based credit assignment.

Note that ATPO is orthogonal to the tree search framework, and serves as a plug-in design for any multi-turn agentic rl tasks. To better assess the effectiveness of turn-level optimization in ATPO, we also introduce a diagnostic metric called turn entropy Hturn, which quantifies the degree of variation in policy updates across different turns within a trajectory. The details are presented in Appendix A.

Datasets. We evaluate our approach in a toolintegrated knowledge search setting. Following the instructions in Search-R1 (Jin et al., 2025), we implement a lightweight search engine and assess performance on seven widely adopted question answering benchmarks. These datasets are grouped into two categories: MultiHop QA—HotpotQA (Yang et al., 2018), 2WikiMultihopQA (Ho et al., 2020), MuSiQue (Trivedi et al., 2022), and Bamboogle (Press et al., 2023); and Single-Hop QA—Natural Questions (NQ) (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019), TriviaQA (Joshi et al., 2017), and PopQA (Mallen et al., 2022). All benchmarks are evaluated using Qwen3-4B, Qwen3-8B and Qwen2.5-7B models as the backbone, respectively. We use Exact Match (EM) as the primary evaluation metric across all datasets. Critically, our selection avoids reliance on proprietary or costly APIs and imposes minimal hardware requirements, ensuring that our evaluation is both reproducible and focused squarely on algorithmic advances.

Baselines. We compare AT2PO against the following widely-accepted RLVR baselines: GRPO

(Guo et al., 2025), DAPO (Yu et al., 2025b), GSPO (Zheng et al., 2025). We also compare AT2PO against two most recent agentic RL baselines: AEPO (Dong et al., 2025a) and Tree-GRPO (Ji et al., 2025). Note that we notice the performance of Tree-GRPO is highly unstable, even collapses at an early stage on Qwen-3 models. We provide further analysis on the possible cause in the Appendix C. We also report the base results by directly inferring via ReAct (Yao et al., 2023b).

Implementation Details. All experiments are conducted via respective RL recipes without any additional SFT phase. We use a training batch size of 64, a mini-batch size of 8 and the maximum response length of 6192. During rollout, we configure AT2PO with M = 10,L = 2 and K = 6, while other baselines except DAPO use a global rollout size of 16. These settings ensure a comparable total token budget across methods. The maximum tool usage is set to 6. The clipping thresholds for the ATPO objective are set to 3e-3 and 4e-3. All experiments are trained for 240 steps, and we compute the average accuracy across all evaluation samples. We select and report results from the checkpoint with the highest average score. Additional implementation specifics are provided in Section B.

#### 5.2 Main Results of AT2PO

We report the performance of all baseline methods and AT2PO across different backbone models and benchmarks in Table 1.

Overall, AT2PO achieves the best results among most compared methods, yielding improvements of up to 1.84 percentage points in average over the state-of-the-art baseline across multi-hop and single-hop benchmarks. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of AT2PO in agentic RL. We note that AT2PO is slightly outperformed on certain single-hop QA datasets. A key reason is that DAPO employs a dynamic sampling strategy that utilizes up to three times the rollout budget compared to all other methods, including AT2PO. When evaluated under an equal computational budget to other baselines, AT2PO achieves the highest average performance across all settings.

Notably, AT2PO exhibits larger gains on multihop benchmarks than on single-hop ones. This stems from the fact that multi-hop tasks require significantly more interaction turns to retrieve the correct answer, allowing the turn-level design of AT2PO to fully demonstrate its advantage.

in the validation set in Figure 4, while 43.5% of samples in the single-hop benchmark require only a single tool call followed immediately by the answering turn, nearly all samples in the multi-hop benchmark necessitate at least two tool interactions. Consequently, AT2PO achieves state-of-the-art performance across all multi-hop settings, while still delivering strong results on single-hop benchmarks.

Furthermore, we analyze the training dynamics of AT2PO in detail. Figure 3 shows entropy evolution and validation accuracy across training steps. We observe that standard token-level optimization methods such as GRPO suffer from early entropy collapse, which severely limits their abil-

ity to explore high-quality trajectories. AEPO, which adapts a modified objective from GPPO (Su et al., 2025a) using a soft clipping strategy to preserve gradients for all tokens, avoids early collapse but exhibits gradual entropy divergence over longhorizon training. In contrast, AT2PO maintains the most stable entropy trajectory, effectively balancing exploration with gradient optimization stability.

where modules are incrementally added. This setup enables us to isolate the effect of each design choice under a fixed backbone and consistent task suite.

Starting from a base configuration of standard GRPO with random tree search, replacing it with ATPO yields substantial gains across all multi-hop benchmarks. This highlights that the turn-wise importance sampling and clipping provides a significantly finer-grained optimization objective than vanilla GRPO in multi-turn agentic RL. Next, integrating Entropy-Guided Tree Expansion leads to a further clear performance improvement. This indicates that entropy-aware branching facilitates more effective exploration during tree-based rollouts, enabling the agent to allocate its limited search budget toward more informative decision points. Finally, adding Turn-wise Credit Assignment delivers additional gains and achieves the best overall performance. This demonstrates that providing finegrained, step-level learning signals to individual turns effectively mitigates the credit assignment problem inherent in sparse-reward agentic tasks.

5.3.2 Scheme Analysis of Turn-wise Credit Assignment

- Table 3 and Table 5 compare different formulations of turn-wise credit assignment by varying both the advantage definition and the value aggregation strategy. We consider three strategies for estimating the node value Vn: (a) child-weighted

propagation as defined in in Eq (3), (b) mean of all child values and (c) mean of all leaf values following TreeRL (Hou et al., 2025). As for advantage computation f(·), our main experiments adopt the simplest formulation An = Vn. We further compare this with several difference-based alternatives: (a) the TD advantage An = Ln = Vn − Vnparent, (b) the global advantage An = Gn = Vn − Vnroot and (c) the combined signal An = Ln + Gn as used in prior work (Hou et al., 2025).

Overall, directly setting An = Vn yields best performance across all datasets. Under this formulation, child-weighted aggregation achieves the best results, while child-mean and leaf-mean aggregation remain competitive but slightly inferior. In contrast, difference-based formulations lead to noticeably lower performance. Surprisingly, the combined signal, despite its demonstrated effectiveness in conventional RLVR settings (Yao et al., 2023a), performs worst among all variants. In the agentic RL, directly using Vn as the advantage provides a cleaner and more compatible learning signal.

### 6 Conclusion

In this paper, we present AT2PO, a unified framework for multi-turn agentic RL. Through EntropyGuided Tree Expansion, we enable strategic exploration at uncertain decision points; via Turnwise Credit Assignment, we propagate sparse outcome rewards to derive fine-grained supervision signals; and with Agentic Turn-based Policy Optimization, we align policy updates with the natural turn-based structure. Extensive experiments across seven benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines, validating the effectiveness of each component. Our framework offers a promising approach to training LLM agents for complex multi-turn reasoning and tool-use tasks.

### 7 Limitations

While AT2PO achieves strong empirical performance, its tree-based expansion introduces additional computational overhead compared to linear rollouts particularly when sufficient computational resources are available, as the expansion process requires multiple sequential iterations. Future work will explore more efficient rollout strategies through enhanced parallelization. Additionally, we aim to evaluate AT2PO in a broader range of agentic environments to further assess its generalization and robustness.

### A Analysis of ATPO Objective

In this section, we clarify the distinctions among token-level, sequence-level, and turn-level policy optimization objectives, highlighting how each approach leverages different granularities of policy updates.

Token-Level Optimization. GRPO (Shao et al., 2024) computes the relative advantage of each response within a group and optimizes the following token-level objective:

JGRPO(θ) = Ex∼D,{y

i}Gi=1∼πθold(·|x)

|yi|

G

1 G

1 |yi|

Mi,t min ri,t(θ) Ai,t,

t=1

clip ri,t(θ),1 − ε,1 + ε Ai,t ,

(6)

where the importance sampling ratio is defined at the token level as

πθ(yi,t|x,yi,<t) πθold(yi,t|x,yi,<t)

. (7)

ri,t(θ) =

Notably, All tokens in a sample share the same advantage Aˆi,t = Aˆi.

Sequence-Level Optimization. In contrast, GSPO (Zheng et al., 2025) adopts a sequence-level perspective by defining the importance ratio based on the entire response likelihood:

JGSPO(θ) = Ex∼D,{y

i}Gi=1∼πθold(·|x)

|yi|

G

1 |yi|

1 G

Mi,t min si,t(θ)Aˆi,t,

(8)

with the sequence-aware importance ratio given by

 

si,t(θ) = sg

πθold(yi|x)

(9)

πθ(yi,t|x,yi,<t) sg [πθ(yi,t|x,yi,<t)]

·

.

Here, sg[·] denotes the stop-gradient operator. By anchoring the importance weight to the fullsequence likelihood (following (Zheng et al.,

2023)), GSPO ensures that clipping is applied coherently across all tokens in a response, reflecting an all-or-nothing treatment of off-policy sequences.

Turn-Level Optimization. Our proposed Adaptive Turn-level Policy Optimization (ATPO) introduces a turn-aware objective that balances finegrained control with sequence coherence. The objective is:

JATPO(θ) = Ex∼D,{y

i}Gi=1∼πθold(·|x)

|yi|

G

1 G

1 |yi|

Mi,t min sturni,t (θ)Aˆi,t,

t=1

clip sturni,t (θ),1 − εl,1 + εr A ˆi,t ,

(10) where the turn-level importance ratio is defined as

πθ(yi,t|x,yi,<t) sg [πθ(yi,t|x,yi,<t)]

sturni,t (θ) =

  πθ(yik(t)|x,yi<k(t))

i | .

(11)

1 |y

· sg

πθold(yik(t)|x,yi<k(t))

Here yi,t belongs to the k(t)-th response turn yik(t). This formulation enables selective gradient propa-

gation: if tokens from a particular turn are highly off-policy, their contribution to the gradient can be suppressed without discarding updates from other more on-policy turns. The gradient is derived as follows,

∇θJAT2PO(θ) = Ex∼D,{y

To better assess the effectiveness of turn-level optimization in ATPO, we also introduce a diagnostic metric called turn entropy Hturn, which quantifies the degree of variation in policy updates across different turns within a trajectory:

where Ni is number of turns of the i-th sample in batch, KLi,j is the KL divergence between the old and new policies at turn j, and KLi,seq is the total KL divergence of the full sequence.

We normalize Hturn to [0,1]. A special value of Hturn = 1 indicates uniform policy updates across all turns, while Hturn = 0 occurs when every sample contains only one turn. Conversely, smaller values signify greater heterogeneity in turnlevel updates, highlighting scenarios where turnaware optimization is particularly beneficial.

Figure 5 plots Hturn throughout training across all experiment settings. The entropy stabilizes around 0.66 for multi-hop benchmarks and 0.62 for single-hop benchmarks, confirming significant variation in turn-level policy update and justifying the need for turn-granular optimization. Interestingly, we find that Hturn gradually increases during training across all settings, suggesting that as the policy converges, update magnitudes become more balanced across turns, which is a sign of stabilized and high-quality learning.

### B Implementation Details B.1 Reward Design

We adopt a binary rule-based reward function to obtain the final outcome reward in our agentic RL framework, focusing on both answer correctness and format completeness of LLM’s output. To be detailed, we follow the reward modeling setting of Search-R1 (Jin et al., 2025) which utilizes the EM-score as primary reward. Meanwhile, we also introduce the appropriate format constraint in this process.

Exact Match Reward Let yˆ denote the agent’s predicted final answer and y∗ the ground-truth an-

swer. We leverage an Exact Match (EM) score as the primary metric of answer correctness:

rEM (ˆy,y∗) =

1, if yˆ = y∗ 0, otherwise

(14)

This strict binary reward provides an unambiguous reward signal, encouraging the agenic LLM to produce fully correct answers rather than partially correct or ambiguous outputs. Compared to continuous value rewards like F1-score, it has a higher upper bound for reinforcement training.

Format Constraint In addition to the correctness of answer, we enforce a format validation constraint on the model output as well. Specifically, the generated response is necessary to contain both a reasoning trace and a final answer segment, explicitly delimited by the tags <think>...</think> and

<answer>...</answer>, respectively. Besides, The final answer used for matching needs to be enclosed within \boxed{} (within <answer>...</answer>). Formally, we define a format validation function as follows:

Iformat =

1, if both tags are present 0, otherwise

(15)

If the response violates the required format, the reward is set to zero regardless of the predicted answer correctness. This plays an important role for improving the model’s ability to follow user’s instructions.

Final Reward Definition Based on the above, the overall reward r is defined as the synthesis of exact match correctness and format constraint:

rEM(ˆy,y∗), if Iformat = 1 −1, otherwise

(16)

r =

Consequently, the agentic LLM derives a reward of 1 if and only if it outputs a correctly formatted output whose final answer exactly matches the ground truth.

#### B.2 Prompt Template

We present our prompt template as Figure 6. We follow the similar setting in (Jin et al., 2025) and (Dong et al., 2025a) with different tags containing corresponding content. Specifically, the model outputs its intermediate reasoning within the

<think></think> tags and makes a search request by emitting the <search></search> tag, which corresponds to an action in the agent–environment interaction process. The content returned by the

#### Prompt Template.

You are a helpful assistant that can solve the given question step by step with the help of the wikipedia search tool. Given a question, you need to first think about the reasoning process in the mind and then provide the answer. During thinking, you can invoke the wikipedia search tool to search for fact information about specific topics if needed. You can search as many times as your want. The reasoning process and answer are enclosed within <think> </think> and <answer> </answer> tags respectively, and the search query and result are enclosed within <search> </search> and <result> </result> tags respectively. For example, <think> This is the reasoning process. </think> <search> search query here </search> <result> search result here </result> <think> This is the reasoning process. </think> <answer> The final answer is [ \boxed{answer here} ] </answer>. In the last part of the answer, the final exact answer is enclosed within \boxed{} with latex format. Question:

search engine is wrapped in <result></result> tags and embedded into the response context. Finally, after completing the reasoning process, the model outputs the content of answer within the

<answer></answer> tags. Noting that we exact the final answer from the \boxed{} in response to achieve more accurate EM score matching.

#### B.3 Datasets

We introduce two categories of benchmarks adopted in our experiments in this section.

Multi-Hop QA. To evaluate the multi-turn tool calling and complex reasoning capabilities, we adopt four datasets that require reasoning over multiple steps. HotpotQA (Yang et al., 2018) is a largescale Wikipedia-based benchmark with strong supervision for supporting facts, widely used to evaluate explainable multi-hop reasoning. 2WikiMultiHopQA (Ho et al., 2020) consists of Wikipedia text and Wikidata triples, which is a comprehensive benchmark with multi-hop dependency between entities. Musique (Trivedi et al., 2022) has 25k 2-4 hop questions synthesized via controlled composition of single-hop content. Bamboogle (Press et al., 2023) is a tiny dataset consisting of complex compositional QA questions, which benefits the evaluation of the effectiveness and stability of agentic RL methods.

Single-Hop QA. We further adopt three singlehop QA benchmarks. Natural Questions (NQ) (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019) is widely used to assess retrieval-augmented generation, which includes large quantity of user queries from Wikipedia. TriviaQA (Joshi et al., 2017) contains questions

with syntactic and lexical variability between questions and corresponding answer-evidence sentences. PopQA (Mallen et al., 2022) is an entitycentric open-domain QA dataset, designed to explore the interaction between agentic retrieval and parametric memorization.

#### B.4 Baseline Settings

In Table 4, we exhitbit common hyperparameter settings used for baselines in main experiment. We further detail the baselines selected in our main experiments and illustrate the corresponding specially adjusted experiment settings.

- • ReAct (Yao et al., 2023b): A prompting paradigm to enable procedural planning and dynamic function calls(tool calls), which is training-free.
- • GRPO (Guo et al., 2025): A group-based onpolicy RL optimization method, which generates n sets of candidates by multiple sampling for each prompt to derive the relative advantages, thereby replacing the traditional critic used in PPO. We set the coefficient to 0.001 for KL constraint. The clip ratio is set to 0.2.
- • DAPO (Yu et al., 2025b): An extension of GRPO that incorporates a decoupled clipping mechanism and dynamic sampling to stabilize policy updates. Following the recommended configuration, we set clip_ratio_low and clip_ratio_high to 0.2 and 0.28, respectively, to enable a wider clipping range. Additionally, we configure the overlong_buffer

with a capacity of 2000 (penalty factor 1.0) and activate the dynamic sampling mechanism. Consistent with DAPO’s default setup, the generation batch size is set to three times the training batch size.

- • GSPO (Zheng et al., 2025): A sequence-level variant of GRPO that defines importance ratios and clipping based on full response likelihoods, trading fine-grained token-level control for improved sequence-level stability. Analogous to DAPO, we adopt asymmetric clipping with clip_ratio_low = 3×10−4 and clip_ratio_high = 4×10−4 to support precise sequence-level clipping.
- • AEPO (Dong et al., 2025a): A state-of-the-art agentic RL method that introduces entropybalanced rollout scheduling and entropyaware clipping to mitigate over-branching and gradient collapse in tree-based rollouts. In our experiments, we set initial_rollouts to 8. Additional hyperparameters include beam_size = 2, branch_probability = 0.5, and entropy_weight = 0.2.
- • Tree-GRPO (Ji et al., 2025): A tree-based agentic RL framework that integrates GRPO with tree search to enable fine-grained credit assignment across branching trajectories. We replicate the original experiment configuration as reported in the paper.

#### B.5 Search Tool Settings

Follow the settings of search tool in Search-R1 (Jin et al., 2025), we utilize the wikipedia as the cor-

pus for search engine with e5-base-v2 (Wang et al., 2022) as the retriever model. The retrieval knowledge base contains 21 million data entries obtained from Wikipedia. After the agentic LLM calls the wiki search tool, the search engine will return the top-k most relevant knowledge data determined by the retrieval model at each turn. B.6 Hardware and Artifacts

All experiments are conducted on a system equipped with 8 NVIDIA H20 GPUs. As the backbone models, we employ Qwen3-4B, Qwen3-8B, and Qwen2.5-7B (Yang et al., 2025; Qwen et al., 2025), chosen for their strong foundational reasoning capabilities in agentic RL training. Our implementation is built on the VeRL framework (Sheng et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2024), a mature and stable RL infrastructure that can be easily integrated with agentic RL training features.

### C Analysis on Training Stability

[Figure 4]

Figure 7: Training comparison between the scheme of token-in-token-out and text-in-token-out on Qwen3-4B with multi-hop training set.

During our replication of Tree-GRPO (Ji et al., 2025) using the open-sourced implementation, we observed significant training instability across multiple runs, often leading to complete collapse at very early stages when using Qwen3-based models. We trace this issue primarily to a phenomenon known as Retokenization Drift (vLLM Team, 2025).

In agentic RL rollouts in the Tree-GRPO implementation, intermediate responses are first detokenized into text strings to enable tool invocation and parsing. Tool outputs in string form are then concatenated to the dialogue history, and the entire sequence is retokenized before being used for policy updates. Despite semantic equivalence at the string level, this text-in–token-out pipeline can

yield different token sequences before and after retokenization due to tokenizer nondeterminism, introducing critical inconsistencies between the sampled and training trajectories.

To address this, we adopt a token-in–token-out approach: we preserve the exact token IDs generated at each turn during rollout and use them directly in training, bypassing intermediate detokenization and retokenization. As illustrated in Figure 7, this modification eliminates retokenizationinduced distributional shifts. Empirically, the revised pipeline stabilizes training—both policy entropy and gradient norm remain consistent throughout training, with no signs of collapse.

While this fix resolves a key source of instability, other challenges in stabilizing agentic RL training persist, including consistency between training and inference, etc. These remain important directions for future work beyond the scope of this paper.

- D Detailed Ablations D.1 Ablation Study on AT2PO

Table 2 and Figure 8 present an ablation study on Qwen3-4B to assess the contribution of each component in AT2PO, following a progressive modular where modules are incrementally added. This setup enables us to isolate the effect of each design choice under a fixed backbone and consistent task suite.

Starting from a base configuration that uses the standard GRPO loss with random tree search, replacing it with our proposed ATPO loss yields

substantial gains across all multi-hop benchmarks. This highlights that the turn-wise importance sampling and clipping mechanism provides a significantly finer-grained optimization objective than vanilla GRPO in multi-turn agentic RL. Next, integrating Entropy-Guided Tree Expansion leads to a further clear performance improvement. This indicates that entropy-aware branching facilitates more effective exploration during tree-based rollouts, enabling the agent to allocate its limited search budget toward more informative and uncertain decision points. Finally, adding Turn-wise Credit Assignment—completing the full AT2PO framework—delivers additional gains and achieves the best overall performance. This demonstrates that providing fine-grained, step-level learning signals to individual turns effectively mitigates the credit assignment problem inherent in sparsereward, long-horizon agentic tasks.

D.2 Scheme Analysis of Turn-wise Credit Assignment

Table 3 and Table 5 compare different formulations of turn-wise credit assignment by varying both the advantage definition and the value aggregation strategy. We consider three strategies for estimating the node value Vn: (a) child-weighted propagation as defined in in Eq (3), (b) mean of all child values and (c) mean of all leaf values following TreeRL (Hou et al., 2025). As for advantage computation f(·), our main experiments adopt the

simplest formulation An = Vn. We further compare this with several difference-based alternatives:

(a) the TD advantage An = Ln = Vn − Vnparent, (b) the global advantage An = Gn = Vn − Vnroot and (c) the combined signal An = Ln + Gn as used in prior work (Hou et al., 2025).

Overall, directly setting the advantage equal to the node value yields consistently strong performance across all datasets. Under this formulation, child-weighted aggregation achieves the best results, while child-mean and leaf-mean aggregation remain competitive but slightly inferior. In contrast, difference-based formulations lead to noticeably lower performance. Surprisingly, the combined signal, despite its demonstrated effectiveness in conventional RLVR settings (Yao et al., 2023a), performs worst among all variants. In the agentic RL scenario, directly using Vn as the advantage provides a cleaner and more compatible learning signal.

### E Case Study

We conduct the case study which is presented through Table 6 to Table 12. Specifically, in order to more intuitively illustrate the reasoning process and tool usage in agentic RL, we selected one representative case generated by our method from each of the seven benchmarks used in the main experiments above. We use different colored boxes to describe the different states and actions of the agentic LLM during the reasoning process. For multi-hop QA datasets, which mainly include more complex question-answering problems requiring multi-step reasoning, agentic LLMs typically exhibit more multi-turn tool calls and interactions compared to single-hop QA questions. This is consistent with the statistics shown in Figure 4.

***Four turn search steps omitted here***

<think> The search result doesn’t mention "Vasantha Raagam" directly. However, given that "August Underground’s Penance" is from 2007, and "Vasantha Raagam" might be a 1960s film, I can infer that "Vasantha Raagam" was released earlier. Alternatively, if "Vasantha Raagam" is a 2007 film, then both would be the same. But since the user is asking which was released earlier, and "August Underground’s Penance" is 2007, I need to check if "Vasantha Raagam" is older. Since I couldn’t find exact info, I’ll have to make an educated guess based on the available data. Given that "August Underground’s Penance" is from 2007, and "Vasantha Raagam" might be a classic film from the 1960s or 1970s, it’s likely that "Vasantha Raagam" was released earlier. Based on the information gathered, "August Underground’s Penance" was released in 2007. "Vasantha Raagam" is likely a classic film from the 1960s or 1970s, which would make it older than "August Underground’s Penance".

Since the user didn’t specify, but the first result is about the painter, but the second is about a cartoonist. Maybe the answer depends on which one is being asked. However, the initial search query was "Eleanor Davis’s occupation" and the result includes both. But the second result is more recent, so maybe that’s the one. Let me confirm. The second result says Eleanor Davis (born 1983) is an American cartoonist and illustrator. So if the user is referring to that person, the answer is cartoonist and illustrator. But the first result is about a painter. Maybe the user is referring to the cartoonist, as that is more common in modern contexts. However, without more context, it’s ambiguous. But since the search result includes both, perhaps the answer is painter. However, the second result is more recent and has more specific info. Let me check the exact name. The result says "Eleanor Davis (born January 16, 1983) is an American cartoonist and illustrator..." So if the user is referring to that person, the answer is cartoonist and illustrator. But the initial search result is about the painter. Maybe the user is referring to the cartoonist. However, the first result is about Eleanor Layfield Davis, which is a different name. Maybe the user made a typo or is referring to the cartoonist. Since the second result is more recent, I think that’s the intended person. Let me confirm. Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to the painter. But since the search result includes both, I need to check which one is more likely. Since the user didn’t specify, but the first result is about a painter, and the second is about a cartoonist, perhaps the answer is painter. However, the second result is more detailed. Maybe the answer is cartoonist. But without more info, I need to choose based on the search results. Since the second result is from the search, and it’s more recent, I think that’s the one. So the answer is cartoonist and illustrator.
