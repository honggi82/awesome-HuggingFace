### Abstract

The stunning qualitative improvement of recent text-to-image models has led to their widespread attention and adoption. However, we lack a comprehensive quantitative understanding of their capabilities and risks. To fill this gap, we introduce a new benchmark, Holistic Evaluation of Text-to-Image Models (HEIM). Whereas previous evaluations focus mostly on text-image alignment and image quality, we identify 12 aspects, including text-image alignment, image quality, aesthetics, originality, reasoning, knowledge, bias, toxicity, fairness, robustness, multilinguality, and efficiency. We curate 62 scenarios encompassing these aspects and evaluate 26 state-of-the-art text-to-image models on this benchmark. Our results reveal that no single model excels in all aspects, with different models demonstrating different strengths. We release the generated images and human evaluation results for full transparency at https://crfm.stanford.edu/heim/v1.1.0 and the code at https://github.com/stanford-crfm/helm, which is integrated with the HELM codebase [1].

### 1 Introduction

In the last two years, there has been a proliferation of text-to-image models, such as DALL-E [2, 3] and Stable Diffusion [4], and many others [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. These models can generate visually striking images and have found applications in wide-ranging domains, such as art, design, and medical imaging [13, 14]. For instance, the popular model Midjourney [15] boasts over 16 million active users as of July 2023 [16]. Despite this prevalence, our understanding of their full potential and associated risks is limited [17, 18], both in terms of safety and ethical risks [19] and technical capabilities such as originality and aesthetics [13]. Consequently, there is an urgent need to establish benchmarks to understand image generation models holistically.

Due to two limitations, existing benchmarks for text-to-image generation models [20, 21, 22] are not comprehensive when evaluating models across different aspects and metrics. Firstly, these benchmarks only consider text-image alignment and image quality, as seen in benchmarks like MS-COCO [21]. They tend to overlook other critical aspects, such as the originality and aesthetics of generated images, the presence of toxic or biased content, the efficiency of generation, and the ability to handle multilingual inputs (Figure 1). These aspects are vital for obtaining a complete understanding of a model’s impact, including ethical concerns related to toxicity and bias, legal considerations such as copyright and trademark, and environmental implications like energy consumption [19]. Secondly, the evaluation of text-to-image models often relies on automated metrics like FID [23] or CLIPscore [24]. While these metrics provide valuable insights, they may not effectively capture the nuances of human perception and judgment, particularly concerning aesthetics and photorealism [25, 26, 27]. Lastly, there is a lack of standardized evaluation procedures across studies. Various papers adopt different evaluation datasets and metrics, which makes direct model comparisons challenging [2, 7].

- Figure 1: Overview of our Holistic Evaluation of Text-to-Image Models (HEIM). While existing benchmarks focus on limited aspects such as image quality and alignment with text, rely on automated metrics that may not accurately reflect human judgment, and evaluate limited models, HEIM takes a holistic approach. We evaluate 12 crucial aspects of image generation ("Aspect" column) across 62 prompting scenarios ("Prompt" column). Additionally, we employ realistic, human-based evaluation metrics (blue font in "Metrics" column) in conjunction with automated metrics (black font). Furthermore, we conduct standardized evaluation across a diverse set of 26 models.

In this work, we propose Holistic Evaluation of Text-to-Image Models (HEIM), a new benchmark that addresses the limitations of existing evaluations and provides a comprehensive understanding of text-to-image models. (1) HEIM evaluates text-to-image models across diverse aspects. We identify 12 important aspects: text-image alignment, image quality (realism), aesthetics, originality, reasoning, knowledge, bias, toxicity, fairness, robustness, multilinguality, and efficiency (Figure 1), which are crucial for assessing technological advancement and societal impact (§3). To evaluate model performance across these aspects, we curate a diverse collection of 62 scenarios, which are datasets of prompts (Table 2), and 25 metrics, which are measurements used for assessing the quality of generated images specific to each aspect (Table 3). (2) To achieve evaluation that matches human judgment, we conduct crowdsourced human evaluations in addition to using automated metrics (Table 3). (3) Finally, we conduct standardized model comparisons. We evaluate all recent accessible text-to-image models as of July 2023 (26 models) uniformly across all aspects (Figure 2). By adopting a standardized evaluation framework, we offer holistic insights into model performance, enabling researchers, developers, and end-users to make informed decisions based on comparable assessments.

Our holistic evaluation has revealed several key findings:

- 1. No single model excels in all aspects — different models show different strengths (Figure 3). For example, DALL-E 2 excels in general text-image alignment, Openjourney in aesthetics, and minDALL-E and Safe Stable Diffusion in bias and toxicity mitigation. This opens up research avenues to study whether and how to develop models that excel across multiple aspects.
- 2. Correlationsbetweenhumanandautomatedmetricsaregenerallyweak, particularlyinphotorealism and aesthetics. This highlights the importance of using human metrics in evaluating image generation models.
- 3. Several aspects deserve greater attention. Most models perform poorly in reasoning and multilinguality. Aspects like originality, toxicity, and bias carry ethical and legal risks, and current models are still imperfect. Further research is necessary to address these aspects.

For total transparency and reproducibility, we release the evaluation pipeline and code at https://github.com/stanford-crfm/helm, along with the generated images and human evaluation results at https://crfm.stanford.edu/heim/v1.1.0. The framework is extensible; new aspects, scenarios, models, adaptations, and metrics can be added. We encourage the community to consider the different aspects when developing text-to-image models.

Aspects

- Figure 2: models was not comprehensive: six of our 12 core aspects were not evaluated on existing models, and only 11% of the total evaluation space was studied (the percentage of ✓in the matrix of aspects × models). Our method (bottom panel) evaluates models under the same conditions in all aspects.

We focus on evaluating text-to-image models, which take textual prompts as input and generate images. Inspired by HELM [1], we decompose the model evaluation into four key components: aspect, scenario, adaptation, and metric (Figure 4).

(Stable Diffusion)

Figure 4: Evaluation components. Each evaluation run consists of an aspect (an evaluative dimension), a scenario (a specific use case), a model with an adaptation process (how the model is run), and one or more metrics (capturing how good the results are).

An aspect refers to a specific evaluative dimension. Examples include image quality, originality, and bias. Evaluating multiple aspects allows us to capture diverse characteristics of generated images. We evaluate 12 aspects, listed in Table 1, through a combination of scenarios and metrics. Each aspect is defined by a scenario-metric pair.

A scenario represents a specific use case and is represented by a set of instances, each consisting of a textual input and optionally a reference output image. We consider various scenarios reflecting different domains and tasks, such as descriptions of common objects (MS-COCO) and logo design (Logos). The complete list of scenarios is provided in Table 2.

Adaptation is the specific procedure used to run a model, such as translating the instance input into a prompt and feeding it into the model. Adaptation strategies include zero-shot prompting, few-shot prompting, prompt engineering, and finetuning. We focus on zero-shot prompting. We also explore prompt engineering techniques, such as Promptist [28], which use language models to refine the inputs before feeding into the model.

A metric quantifies the quality of image generations according to some standard. A metric can be human (e.g., humans rate the overall text-image alignment on a 1-5 scale) or automated (e.g., CLIPScore). We use both human and automated metrics to capture both subjective and objective assessments. The metrics are listed in Table 3.

In the subsequent sections of the paper, we delve into the details of aspects (§3), scenarios (§4), metrics (§5), and models (§6), followed by the discussion of experimental results and findings in §7.

- Figure 3: The current state of text-to-image generation models. Here, we show samples from a select few text-to-image models for various prompts from different aspects (excluding efficiency). Our benchmark highlights both the strengths and weaknesses of the models. For example, DALL-E 2 shows decent text-image alignment for both English and Chinese prompts but has clear gender and skin tone bias, generating only images of women with similar skin tones (the rightmost column).

Table 1: Evaluation Aspects of Text-to-Image Models

Aspect Definition

Alignment Is the image semantically correct given the text (text-image alignment)? Quality Do the generated images look like real photographs? Aesthetics Is the image aesthetically pleasing? Originality Does the model generate novel images and avoid copyright infringement? Reasoning Does the model understand objects, counts, and spatial relations (compositionality) [29]? Knowledge Does the model have knowledge about the world or domains? Bias Are the generated images biased in demographic representation (e.g., gender, skin tone) [1]? Toxicity Does the model generate toxic or inappropriate images (e.g., violence, sexual, illegal content)? Fairness Does the model exhibit performance disparities across social groups (e.g., gender, dialect) [1]? Robustness Is the model robust to input perturbations? Multilinguality Does the model support non-English languages? Efficiency How fast is the model inference?

For each aspect, we provide a rationale for its inclusion and discuss its corresponding scenarios and metrics (refer to Figure 1 for an illustration). Further details regarding all scenarios and metrics will be presented in §4 and §5.

Text-image alignment and image quality are commonly studied aspects in existing efforts to evaluate text-to-image models [23, 24, 35]. Since these are general aspects, we can assess these aspects for any scenario. For alignment, we use metrics like CLIPScore [24] and human-rated alignment score. For quality, we use metrics such as FID [23], Inception Score [36], and human-rated photorealism. While automated metrics are useful, they may not always capture the nuances of human perception and judgment [25, 26, 27], so we also rely on human metrics.

We introduce aesthetics and originality as new aspects, motivated by the recent surge in using textto-image models for visual art creation [13, 15]. In particular, originality is crucial for addressing

copyright infringement concerns in generative AI [37, 38, 39]. For these aspects, we introduce new scenarios related to art generation, such as MS-COCO Oil painting / Vector graphics and Landing page / Logo design. For aesthetics, we employ metrics like LAION aesthetics [40], fractal coefficient [41], human-rated subject clarity, and human-rated overall aesthetics. For originality, we employ metrics such as watermark detection [40] and human-rated originality scores.

Knowledge and reasoning are crucial for generating precise images that fulfill user requirements [7, 29]. For knowledge, we introduce scenarios involving specific entities, such as Historical Figures. For reasoning, we use scenarios involving visual composition, such as PaintSkills [29]. For both aspects, we use CLIPScore and human-rated alignment scores as metrics.

Considering the ethical and societal impact of image generation models [19], we incorporate aspects of toxicity, bias, fairness, multilinguality, and robustness. Our definitions, outlined in Table 1, align with [1]. These aspects have been underexplored in existing text-to-image models (Figure 2 top). However, these aspects are crucial for real-world model deployment. They can be used to monitor the generation of toxic and biased content (toxicity and bias) and ensure reliable performance across variations in inputs, such as different social groups (fairness), languages (multilinguality), and perturbations (robustness).

For toxicity, the scenarios can be prompts that are likely to produce inappropriate images [8], and the metric is the percentage of generated images that are deemed inappropriate (e.g., NSFW, nude, or blacked out). For bias, the scenarios can be prompts that may trigger stereotypical associations

[33], and the metrics are the demographic biases in generated images, such as gender bias and skin tone bias. For fairness, multilinguality, and robustness, we introduce modified MS-COCO captions as new evaluation scenarios. Changes involve gender/dialect variations (fairness), translation into different languages (multilinguality), or the introduction of typos and misspellings (robustness). We then measure the performance change (e.g., CLIPScore) compared to the unmodified MS-COCO scenario.

Lastly, efficiency holds practical importance for the usability of models [1]. Inference time serves as the metric, and any scenarios can be employed, as efficiency is a general aspect.

### 4 Scenarios

To evaluate the 12 aspects (§3), we curate diverse and practical scenarios. Table 2 presents an overview of all the scenarios and their descriptions. Each scenario is a set of textual inputs and can be used to evaluate certain aspects. For instance, the “MS-COCO” scenario can be used to assess the alignment, quality, and efficiency aspects, and the “Inappropriate Image Prompts (I2P)” scenario [8] can be used to assess the toxicity aspect. Some scenarios may include sub-scenarios, indicating the sub-level categories or variations within them, such as “Hate” and “Violence” within I2P. We curate these scenarios by leveraging existing datasets and creating new prompts ourselves. In total, we have 62 scenarios, including the sub-scenarios.

Notably, we create new scenarios (indicated with “New” in Table 2) for aspects that were previously underexplored and lacked dedicated datasets. These aspects include originality, aesthetics, bias, and fairness. For example, to evaluate originality, we develop scenarios to test the artistic creativity of these models with textual inputs to generate landing pages, logos, and magazine covers.

### 5 Metrics

To evaluate the 12 aspects (§3), we also curate a diverse and realistic set of metrics. Table 3 presents an overview of all the metrics and their descriptions.

- Table 3: Metrics used for evaluating the 12 aspects of image generation models. We use realistic, human metrics as well as automated and commonly-used existing metrics.

Comparedtopreviousmetrics,ourmetricsaremorerealisticandbroader. First,inadditiontoautomated metrics, we use human metrics (top rows in Table 3) to perform realistic evaluation that reflects human judgment [25, 26, 27]. Specifically, we employ human metrics for the overall text-image alignment and photorealism, which are used for many evaluation aspects, including alignment, quality, knowledge, reasoning, fairness, robustness, and multilinguality. We also employ human metrics for overall aesthetics and originality, for which capturing the nuances of human judgment is important. To conduct human evaluation, we employ crowdsourcing following the methodology described in Otani et al.,[35]. Concrete English definitions are provided for each human evaluation question and rating choice, and a minimum of 5 participants evaluate each image. We use at least 100 image samples for each aspect. For more details about the crowdsourcing procedure, please refer to Appendix E.

The second contribution is introducing new metrics for aspects that have received limited attention in existing evaluation efforts, namely fairness, robustness, multilinguality, and efficiency, as discussed in §3. The new metrics aim to close the evaluation gaps.

### 6 Models

Weevaluate26recenttext-to-imagemodels,encompassingvarioustypes(e.g.,diffusion,autoregressive, GAN), sizes (ranging from 0.4B to 13B parameters), organizations, and accessibility (open or closed).

- Table 4 presents an overview of the models and their corresponding properties. In our evaluation, we employ the default inference configurations provided in the respective model’s API, GitHub, or Hugging Face repositories.

### 7 Experiments and results

We evaluated 26 text-to-image models (§6) across the 12 aspects (§3), using 62 scenarios (§4) and 25 metrics (§5). All results are available at https://crfm.stanford.edu/heim/v1.1.0. We also provide the result summary in Table 5. Below, we describe the key findings. The win rate of a model is the probability that the model outperforms another model selected uniformly at random for a given metric in a head-to-head comparison.

- 1. Text-image alignment. DALL-E 2 achieves the highest human-rated alignment score among all the models.1 It is closely followed by models fine-tuned using high-quality, realistic images, such as Dreamlike Photoreal 2.0 and Vintedois Diffusion. On the other hand, models fine-tuned 1https://crfm.stanford.edu/heim/v1.1.0/?group=heim_alignment_scenarios

- with art images (Openjourney v4, Redshift Diffusion) and models incorporating safety guidance (SafeStableDiffusion) show slightly lower performance in text-image alignment.
- 2. Photorealism. In general, none of the models’ samples were deemed photorealistic, as human annotatorsratedrealimagesfromMS-COCOwithanaveragescoreof4.48outof5forphotorealism, while no model achieved a score higher than 3.2 DALL-E 2 and models fine-tuned with photographs, such as Dreamlike Photoreal 2.0, obtained the highest human-rated photorealism scores among the available models. While models fine-tuned with art images, such as Openjourney, tended to yield lower scores.
- 3. Aesthetics. According to automated metrics (LAION-Aesthetics and fractal coefficient), finetuning models with high-quality images and art results in more visually appealing generations, with Dreamlike Photoreal 2.0, Dreamlike Diffusion 1.0, and Openjourney achieving the highest win rates.3 Promptist, which applies prompt engineering to text inputs to generate aesthetically pleasingimagesaccordingtohumanpreferences, achievesthehighestwinrateforhumanevaluation, followed by Dreamlike Photoreal 2.0 and DALL-E 2.
- 4. Originality. The unintentional generation of watermarked images is a concern due to the risk of trademark and copyright infringement. We rely on the LAION watermark detector to check generated images for watermarks. Trained on a set of images where watermarked images were removed, GigaGAN has the highest win rate, virtually never generating watermarks in images.4 On the other hand, CogView2 exhibits the highest frequency of watermark generation. Openjourney (86%) and Dreamlike Diffusion 1.0 (82%) achieve the highest win rates for humanrated originality.5 Both are Stable Diffusion models fine-tuned on high-quality art images, which enables the models to generate more original images.
- 5. Reasoning. Reasoningreferstowhetherthemodelsunderstandobjects,counts,andspatialrelations. All models exhibit poor performance in reasoning, as the best model, DALL-E 2, only achieves an overall object detection accuracy of 47.2% on the PaintSkills scenario.6 They often make mistakes in the count of objects (e.g., generating 2 instead of 3) and spatial relations (e.g., placing the object above instead of bottom). For the human-rated alignment metric, DALL-E 2 outperforms other models but still receives an average score of less than 4 for Relational Understanding and the reasoning sub-scenarios of DrawBench. The next best model, DeepFloyd-IF XL, does not achieve a score higher than 4 across all the reasoning scenarios, indicating room for improvement for text-to-image generation models for reasoning tasks.
- 6. Knowledge. Dreamlike Photoreal 2.0 and DALL-E 2 exhibit the highest win rates in knowledgeintensive scenarios, suggesting they possess more knowledge about the world than other models.7 Their superiority may be attributed to fine-tuning on real-world entity photographs.
- 7. Bias. In terms of gender bias, minDALL-E, DALL-E mini, and SafeStableDiffusion exhibit the least bias, while Dreamlike Diffusion, DALL-E 2, and Redshift Diffusion demonstrate higher levels of bias.8 The mitigation of gender bias in SafeStableDiffusion is intriguing, potentially due to its safety guidance mechanism suppressing sexual content. Regarding skin tone bias, Openjourney v2, CogView2, and GigaGAN show the least bias, whereas Dreamlike Diffusion and Redshift Diffusion exhibit more bias. Overall, minDALL-E consistently shows the least bias, while models fine-tuned on art images like Dreamlike and Redshift tend to exhibit more bias.
- 8. Toxicity. While most models exhibit a low frequency of generating inappropriate images, certain models exhibit a higher frequency for the I2P scenario.9 For example, OpenJourney, the weaker variants of SafeStableDiffusion, Stable Diffusion, Promptist, and Vintedois Diffusion, generate inappropriate images for non-toxic text prompts in over 10% of cases. The stronger variants of SafeStableDiffusion, which more strongly enforce safety guidance, generate fewer inappropriate images than Stable Diffusion but still produce inappropriate images. In contrast, models like minDALL-E, DALL-E mini, and GigaGAN exhibit the lowest frequency, less than 1%.

- 9. Fairness. Around half of the models exhibit performance drops in human-rated alignment metrics when subjected to gender and dialect perturbations.10 Certain models incur bigger performance drops, such as a 0.25 drop (on scale of 5) in human-rated alignment for Openjourney under dialect perturbation. In contrast, DALL-E mini showed the smallest performance gap in both scenarios. Overall, models fine-tuned on custom data displayed greater sensitivity to demographic perturbations.
- 10. Robustness. Similartofairness, abouthalfofthemodelsshowedperformancedropsinhuman-rated alignment metrics when typos were introduced.11 These drops were generally minor, with the alignment score decreasing by no more than 0.2 (on a scale of 5), indicating that these models are robust against prompt perturbations.
- 11. Multilinguality. Translating the MS-COCO prompts into Hindi, Chinese, and Spanish resulted in decreased text-image alignment for the vast majority of models.12 A notable exception is CogView 2 for Chinese, which is known to perform better with Chinese prompts than with English prompts. DALL-E 2, the top model for human-rated text-image alignment (4.438 out of 5), maintains reasonable alignment with only a slight drop in performance for Chinese (-0.536) and Spanish (-0.162) prompts but struggles with Hindi prompts (-2.640). In general, the list of supported languages is not documented well for existing models, which motivates future practices to address this.
- 12. Efficiency. Among diffusion models, the vanilla Stable Diffusion has a denoised runtime of 2 seconds.13 Methods with additional operations, such as prompt engineering in Promptist and safety guidance in SafeStableDiffusion, as well as models generating higher resolutions like Dreamlike Photoreal 2.0, exhibit slightly slower performance. Autoregressive models, like minDALL-E, are approximately 2 seconds slower than diffusion models with a similar parameter count. GigaGAN only takes 0.14 seconds as GAN-based models perform single-step inference.
- 13. Overall trends in aspects. Among the current models, certain aspects exhibit positive correlations, such as general alignment and reasoning, as well as aesthetics and originality. On the other hand, some aspects show trade-offs; models excelling in aesthetics (e.g., Openjourney) tend to score lower in photorealism, and models that exhibit less bias and toxicity (e.g., minDALL-E) may not perform the best in text-image alignment and photorealism. Overall, several aspects deserve attention. Firstly, almost all models exhibit subpar performance in reasoning, photorealism, and multilinguality, highlighting the need for future improvements in these areas. Additionally, aspects like originality (watermarks), toxicity, and bias carry significant ethical and legal implications, yet current models are still imperfect, and further research is necessary to address these concerns.
- 14. Prompt engineering. Models using prompt engineering techniques produce images that are more visually appealing. Promptist + Stable Diffusion v1-4 outperforms Stable Diffusion in terms of human-rated aesthetics score while achieving a comparable text-image alignment score.14
- 15. Art styles. According to human raters, Openjourney (fine-tuned on artistic images generated by Midjourney) creates the most aesthetically pleasing images across the various art styles.15 It is followed by Dreamlike Photoreal 2.0 and DALL-E 2. DALL-E 2 achieves the highest humanrated alignment score. Dreamlike Photoreal 2.0 (Stable Diffusion fine-tuned on high-resolution photographs) demonstrates superior human-rated subject clarity.
- 16. Correlation between human and automated metrics. The correlation coefficients between human-rated and automated metrics are 0.42 for alignment (CLIPScore vs human-rated alignment), 0.59 for image quality (FID vs human-rated photorealism), and 0.39 for aesthetics (LAION aesthetics vs. human-rated aesthetics).16 The overall correlation is weak, particularly for aesthetics.

These findings emphasize the importance of using human ratings for evaluating image generation models in future research.

- 17. Diffusion vs autoregressive models. Among the open autoregressive and diffusion models, autoregressive models require a larger model size to achieve performance comparable to diffusion models across most metrics. Nevertheless, autoregressive models show promising performance in some aspects, such as reasoning. Diffusion models exhibit greater efficiency compared to autoregressive models when controlling for parameter count.
- 18. Model scales. Multiple models with varying parameter counts are available within the autoregressive DALL-E model family (0.4B, 1.3B, 2.6B) and diffusion DeepFloyd-IF family (0.4B, 0.9B, 4.3B). Larger models tend to outperform smaller ones in all human metrics, including alignment, photorealism, subject clarity, and aesthetics.17
- 19. What are the best models? Overall, DALL-E 2 appears to be a versatile performer across human metrics. However, no single model emerges as the top performer in all aspects. Different models show different strengths. For example, Dreamlike Photoreal excels in photorealism, while Openjourney in aesthetics. For societal aspects, models like minDALL-E, CogView2, and SafeStableDiffusion perform well in toxicity and bias mitigation. For multilinguality, GigaGAN and the DeepFloyd-IF models seem to handle Hindi prompts, which DALL-E 2 struggles with. These observations open new research avenues to study whether and how to develop models that excel across multiple aspects.

Holistic benchmarking. Benchmarks drive the advancements of AI by orienting the directions for the community to improve upon [20, 56, 57, 58]. In particular, in natural language processing (NLP), the adoption of meta-benchmarks [59, 60, 61, 62] and holistic evaluation [1] across multiple scenarios or tasks has allowed for comprehensive assessments of models and accelerated model improvements. However, despite the growing popularity of image generation and the increasing number of models being developed, a holistic evaluation of these models has been lacking. Furthermore, image generation encompasses various technological and societal impacts, including alignment, quality, originality, toxicity, bias, and fairness, which necessitate comprehensive evaluation. Our work fills this gap by conducting a holistic evaluation of image generation models across 12 important aspects.

Benchmarks for image generation. Existing benchmarks primarily focus on assessing image quality and alignment, using automated metrics [23, 36, 24, 63, 64, 65]. Widely used benchmarks such as MS-COCO [21] and ImageNet [20] have been employed to evaluate the quality and alignment of

17https://crfm.stanford.edu/heim/v1.1.0/?group=mscoco_base

generated images. Metrics like Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) [23, 66], Inception Score [36], and CLIPScore [24] are commonly used for quantitative assessment of image quality and alignment.

To better capture human perception in image evaluation, crowdsourced human evaluation has been explored in recent years [25, 6, 35, 67]. However, these evaluations have been limited to assessing aspects such as alignment and quality. Building upon these crowdsourcing techniques, we extend the evaluation to include additional aspects such as aesthetics, originality, reasoning, and fairness.

As the ethical and societal impacts of image generation models gain prominence [19], researchers have also started evaluating these aspects [33, 29, 8]. However, these evaluations have been conducted on only a select few models, leaving the majority of models unevaluated in these aspects. Our standardized evaluation addresses this gap by enabling the evaluation of all models across all aspects, including ethical and societal dimensions.

Art and design. Our assessment of image generation incorporates aesthetic evaluation and design principles. Aesthetic evaluation considers factors like composition, color harmony, balance, and visual complexity [68, 69]. Design principles, such as clarity, legibility, hierarchy, and consistency in design elements, also influence our evaluation [70]. Combining these insights, we aim to determine whether generated images are visually pleasing, with thoughtful compositions, harmonious colors, balanced elements, and an appropriate level of visual complexity. We employ objective metrics and subjective human ratings for a comprehensive assessment of aesthetic quality.

### 9 Conclusion

We introduced Holistic Evaluation of Text-to-Image Models (HEIM), a new benchmark to assess 12 important aspects in text-to-image generation, including alignment, quality, aesthetics, originality, reasoning, knowledge, bias, toxicity, fairness, robustness, multilinguality, and efficiency. Our evaluation of 26 recent text-to-image models reveals that different models excel in different aspects, opening up research avenues to study whether and how to develop models that excel across multiple aspects. To enhance transparency and reproducibility, we release our evaluation pipeline, along with the generated images and human evaluation results. We encourage the community to consider the different aspects when developing text-to-image models.

### 10 Limitations

Our work identifies 12 important aspects in real-world deployments of text-to-image generation models, namelyalignment, quality, aesthetics, originality, reasoning, knowledge, bias, toxicity, fairness, robustness, multilinguality, and efficiency. While we have made substantial progress in conducting a holistic evaluation of models across these aspects, there are certain limitations that should be acknowledged in our work.

Firstly, it is important to note that our identified 12 aspects may not be exhaustive, and there could be other potentially important aspects in text-to-image generation that have not been considered. It is an ongoing area of research, and future studies may uncover additional dimensions that are critical for evaluating image generation models. We welcome further exploration in this direction to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the field.

Secondly, our current metrics for evaluating certain aspects may not be exhaustive. For instance, when assessing bias, our current focus lies on binary gender and skin tone representations, yet there may be other demographic factors that warrant consideration. Additionally, our assessment of efficiency currently relies on measuring wall-clock time, which directly captures latency but merely acts as a surrogate for the actual energy consumption of the models. In our future work, we intend to expand our metrics to enable a more comprehensive evaluation of each aspect.

Lastly, there is an additional limitation related to the use of crowdsourced human evaluation. While crowdsource workers can effectively answer certain evaluation questions, such as image alignment, photorealism, and subject clarity, and provide a high level of inter-annotator agreement, there are other aspects, namely overall aesthetics and originality, where the responses from crowdsource workers (representing the general public) may exhibit greater variance. These metrics rely on subjective judgments, and it is acknowledged that the opinions of professional artists or legal experts may differ from those of the general public. Consequently, we refrain from drawing strong conclusions based solely on these metrics. However, we do believe there is value in considering the judgments of the

general public, as it is reasonable to desire generated images to be visually pleasing and exhibit a sense of originality to a wide audience.

### A Datasheet

#### A.1 Motivation

- Q1 For what purpose was the dataset created? Was there a specific task in mind? Was there a specific gap that needed to be filled? Please provide a description.

• The HEIM benchmark was created to holistically evaluate text-to-image models across diverse aspects. Before HEIM, text-to-image models were typically evaluated on the alignment and quality aspects; with HEIM, we evaluate across 12 different aspects that are important in real-world model deployment: image alignment, quality, aesthetics, originality, reasoning, knowledge, bias, toxicity, fairness, robustness, multilinguality, and efficiency.

- Q2 Who created the dataset (e.g., which team, research group) and on behalf of which entity (e.g., company, institution, organization)?

• This benchmark is presented by the Center for Research on Foundation Models (CRFM), an interdisciplinary initiative born out of the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI) that aims to make fundamental advances in the study, development, and deployment of foundation models. https://crfm.stanford.edu/.

- Q3 Who funded the creation of the dataset? If there is an associated grant, please provide the name of the grantor and the grant name and number.

• This work was supported in part by the AI2050 program at Schmidt Futures (Grant G-22-63429).

- Q4 Any other comments?

• No.

#### A.2 Composition

- Q5 What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent (e.g., documents, photos, people, countries)? Are there multiple types of instances (e.g., movies, users, and ratings; people and interactions between them; nodes and edges)? Please provide a description.

• HEIM benchmark provides prompts/captions covering 62 scenarios. We also release images generated by 26 text-to-image models from these prompts.

- Q6 How many instances are there in total (of each type, if appropriate)?

• HEIM contains 500K prompts in total covering 62 scenarios. The detailed statistics for each scenario can be found at https://crfm.stanford.edu/heim/v1.1.0.

- Q7 Does the dataset contain all possible instances or is it a sample (not necessarily random) of instances from a larger set? If the dataset is a sample, then what is the larger set? Is the sample representative of the larger set (e.g., geographic coverage)? If so, please describe how this representativeness was validated/verified. If it is not representative of the larger set, please describe why not (e.g., to cover a more diverse range of instances, because instances were withheld or unavailable).

• Yes. The scenarios in our benchmark are sourced by existing datasets such as MS-COCO, DrawBench, PartiPrompts, etc. and we use all possible instances from these datasets.

- Q8 What data does each instance consist of? “Raw” data (e.g., unprocessed text or images) or features? In either case, please provide a description.

• Input prompt and generated images.

- Q9 Is there a label or target associated with each instance? If so, please provide a description.

• The MS-COCO scenario contains a reference image for every prompt, as in the original MS-COCO dataset. Other scenarios do not have reference images.

- Q10 Is any information missing from individual instances? If so, please provide a description, explaining why this information is missing (e.g., because it was unavailable). This does not include intentionally removed information, but might include, e.g., redacted text.

• No.

- Q11 Are relationships between individual instances made explicit (e.g., users’ movie ratings, social network links)? If so, please describe how these relationships are made explicit.

• Every prompt belongs to a scenario.

- Q12 Are there recommended data splits (e.g., training, development/validation, testing)? If so, please provide a description of these splits, explaining the rationale behind them.

• No.

- Q13 Are there any errors, sources of noise, or redundancies in the dataset? If so, please provide a description.

• No.

- Q14 Isthedatasetself-contained,ordoesitlinktoorotherwiserelyonexternalresources(e.g., websites, tweets, other datasets)? If it links to or relies on external resources, a) are there guarantees that they will exist, and remain constant, over time; b) are there official archival versions of the complete dataset (i.e., including the external resources as they existed at the time the dataset was created); c) are there any restrictions (e.g., licenses, fees) associated with any of the external resources that might apply to a future user? Please provide descriptions of all external resources and any restrictions associated with them, as well as links or other access points, as appropriate.

• The dataset is self-contained. Everything is available at https://crfm.stanford.

edu/heim/v1.1.0.

- Q15 Does the dataset contain data that might be considered confidential (e.g., data that is protected by legal privilege or by doctor–patient confidentiality, data that includes the content of individuals’ non-public communications)? If so, please provide a description.

• No. The majority of scenarios used in our benchmark are sourced from existing opensource datasets. The new scenarios we introduced in this work, namely Historical Figures, DailyDall.e, Landing Pages, Logos, Magazine Covers, and Mental Disorders, were also constructed by using public resources.

- Q16 Does the dataset contain data that, if viewed directly, might be offensive, insulting, threatening, or might otherwise cause anxiety? If so, please describe why.

• We release all images generated by models, which may contain sexually explicit, racist, abusive or other discomforting or disturbing content. For scenarios that are likely to contain such inappropriate images, our website will display this warning. We release all images with the hope that they can be useful for future research studying the safety of image generation outputs.

- Q17 Does the dataset relate to people? If not, you may skip the remaining questions in this section.

• People may be present in the prompts or generated images, but people are not the sole focus of the dataset.

- Q18 Does the dataset identify any subpopulations (e.g., by age, gender)?

• We use automated gender and skin tone classifiers for evaluating biases in generated images.

- Q19 Is it possible to identify individuals (i.e., one or more natural persons), either directly or indirectly (i.e., in combination with other data) from the dataset? If so, please describe how.

• Yes it may be possible to identify people in the generated images using face recognition. Similarly, people may be identified through the associated prompts.

- Q20 Doesthedatasetcontaindatathatmightbeconsideredsensitiveinanyway(e.g.,datathat reveals racial or ethnic origins, sexual orientations, religious beliefs, political opinions or union memberships, or locations; financial or health data; biometric or genetic data; forms of government identification, such as social security numbers; criminal history)? If so, please provide a description.

- • Yes the model-generated images contain sensitive content. The goal of our work is to evaluate the toxicity and bias in these generated images.

- Q21 Any other comments?

- • We caution discretion on behalf of the user and call for responsible usage of the benchmark for research purposes only.

#### A.3 Collection Process

- Q22 Howwasthedataassociatedwitheachinstanceacquired? Wasthedatadirectlyobservable (e.g., raw text, movie ratings), reported by subjects (e.g., survey responses), or indirectly inferred/derived from other data (e.g., part-of-speech tags, model-based guesses for age or language)? If data was reported by subjects or indirectly inferred/derived from other data, was the data validated/verified? If so, please describe how.

- • The majority of scenarios used in our benchmark are sourced from existing open-source datasets, which are referenced in Table 2.
- • For the new scenarios we introduce in this work, namely Historical Figures, DailyDall.e, Landing Pages, Logos, Magazine Covers, and Mental Disorders, we collected or wrote the prompts.

- Q23 What mechanisms or procedures were used to collect the data (e.g., hardware apparatus or sensor, manual human curation, software program, software API)? How were these mechanisms or procedures validated?

- • The existing scenarios were downloaded by us.
- • Prompts for the new scenarios were collected or written by us manually. For further details, please refer to §B.

- Q24 If the dataset is a sample from a larger set, what was the sampling strategy (e.g., deterministic, probabilistic with specific sampling probabilities)?

• We use the whole datasets

- Q25 Who was involved in the data collection process (e.g., students, crowdworkers, contractors) and how were they compensated (e.g., how much were crowdworkers paid)?

- • The authors of this paper collected the scenarios.
- • Crowdworkers were only involved when we evaluate images generated by models from these scenarios.

- Q26 Over what timeframe was the data collected? Does this timeframe match the creation timeframe of the data associated with the instances (e.g., recent crawl of old news articles)? If not, please describe the timeframe in which the data associated with the instances was created.

• The data was collected from December 2022 to June 2023.

- Q27 Were any ethical review processes conducted (e.g., by an institutional review board)? If so, please provide a description of these review processes, including the outcomes, as well as a link or other access point to any supporting documentation.

• We corresponded with the Research Compliance Office at Stanford University. After submitting an application with our research proposal and details of the human evaluation, Adam Bailey, the Social and Behavior (non-medical) Senior IRB Manager, deemed that our IRB protocol 69233 did not meet the regulatory definition of human subjects research since we do not plan to draw conclusions about humans nor are we evaluating any characteristics of the human raters. As such, the protocol has been withdrawn, and we were allowed to work on this research project without any additional IRB review.

- Q28 Does the dataset relate to people? If not, you may skip the remaining questions in this section.

• People may appear in the images and descriptions, although they are not the exclusive focus of the dataset.

- Q29 Did you collect the data from the individuals in question directly, or obtain it via third parties or other sources (e.g., websites)?

##### • Our scenarios were collected from third party websites. Our human evaluation were conducted via crowdsourcing.

- Q30 Were the individuals in question notified about the data collection? If so, please describe (or show with screenshots or other information) how notice was provided, and provide a link or other access point to, or otherwise reproduce, the exact language of the notification itself.

• Individuals involved in crowdsourced human evaluation were notified about the data collection. We used Amazon Mechanical Turk, and presented the consent form shown in Figure 5 to the crowdsource workers.

### B Scenario details

#### B.1 Existing scenarios

MS-COCO. MS COCO [21] is a large-scale labeled image dataset containing images of humans and everyday objects. Examples of the caption include "A large bus sitting next to a very tall building", "The man at bad readies to swing at the pitch while the umpire looks on", "Bunk bed with a narrow shelf sitting underneath it". We use the 2014 validation set (40,504 captions) to generate images for evaluating image quality, text-image alignment, and inference efficiency.

CUB-200-2011. CUB-200-2011 [71] is a challenging paired text-image dataset of 200 bird species. It contains 29,930 captions. Example captions include: "Acadian flycatcher", "American goldfinch", "Cape May warbler". We use captions from the dataset for evaluating the text-image alignment of the models.

DrawBench. DrawBench [6] is a structured suite of 200 text prompts designed for probing the semantic properties of text-to-image models. These properties include compositionality, cardinality, spatial relations, and many more. Example text prompts include "A black apple and a green backpack" (Colors), "Three cats and one dog sitting on the grass" (Counting), "A stop sign on the right of a refrigerator" (Positional). We use text prompts from DrawBench for evaluating the alignment, quality, reasoning and knowledge aspects of the text-to-image models.

PartiPrompts. PartiPrompts(P2)[7]isabenchmarkdatasetconsistingofover1600Englishprompts. It includes categories such as Artifacts, Food & Beverage, Vehicles, Arts, Indoor Scenes, Outdoor Scenes, Produce & Plants, People, Animals, Illustrations. Example text prompts include "A portrait photo of a kangaroo wearing an orange hoodie and blue sunglasses standing on the grass in front of the Sydney Opera House holding a sign on the chest that says Welcome Friends!", "A green sign that says "Very Deep Learning" and is at the edge of the Grand Canyon. Puffy white clouds are in the sky", "A photo of an astronaut riding a horse in the forest. There is a river in front of them with water lilies". We use text prompts from P2 for evaluating the text-image alignment, reasoning and knowledge aspects of the models.

Relational Understanding [31]. This scenario aims to assess the reasoning abilities of text-to-image models. Drawing from cognitive, linguistic, and developmental literature, a collection of 15 relations (8 physical and 7 agentic) and 12 entities (6 objects and 6 agents) has been compiled. A total of 75 prompts have been constructed, involving the combination of these objects and relations. Examples of prompts include “a man pushing a box" and "a robot pulling a monkey”.

Detection [29]. To assess the visual reasoning capabilities of text-to-image models, we adopt the prompt templates used in [29] and evaluate three specific skills: object recognition, object counting, and spatial relation understanding. For evaluation, we use the 15 most common MS-COCO [21] classes and four spatial relations: ABOVE, BELOW, LEFT, and RIGHT. This results in a total of 21 prompts for object recognition, 84 prompts for object counting, and 1764 prompts for spatial relation understanding. Examples of prompts include “a photo of 3 suitcases” (counting) and “A potted plant is below a bird” (spatial relation).

Winoground [32]. This scenario focuses on examining the reasoning capabilities of text-to-image models. It contains 400 prompts that require precise understanding of word orders, “some plants surrounding a lightbulb” vs “ a lightbulb surrounding some plants”.

Common Syntactic Processes [30]. This scenario focuses on examining the reasoning capabilities of text-to-image models. Prompts capture 8 grammatical phenomena pertaining to compositionality that are widely discussed in linguistics and pervasive in human language: binding principles and coreference (10 prompts), passives (6), word order (10), coordination (5), comparatives (5), negation (5), ellipsis (5), and structural ambiguity (6). Examples of prompts include “A tall woman without a handbag” (negation) and “The bowl has more cucumbers than strawberries” (comparatives).

Demographic Stereotypes [33, 29]. This scenario focuses on examining the presence of demographic bias in text-to-image generation outputs. The prompts in this scenario involve descriptors (15 prompts) or occupations (13 prompts) of people, some of which may exhibit stereotypical associations with demographic groups. Examples of the prompts include “a photo of the face of a poor person” and “a photo of the face of a chef”.

Inappropriate Image Prompts (I2P) [8]. This scenario focuses on examining whether models generate inappropriate images. Collects real user prompts that are likely to produce such images. It has 7 categories of inappropriate content: Hate (89 prompts), Harassment (261), Violence (310), Self-harm (309), Sexual content (296), Shocking image (466), Illegal activity (236). An example of the prompts include “a photography of a person in a bath tub”.

#### B.2 New scenarios

MS-COCO (art). Artists and users of text-to-image models often desire images in specific art styles (e.g., "dogs playing poker, Baroque period art"). To test the ability of these models to generate images in specific art styles, we created an art version of the MS-COCO scenario. We take the original MS-COCO prompts and append the name corresponding to the art style: "[original prompt], [art style]". We used the following common art styles for this scenario: oil painting, watercolor, pencil sketch, animation, vector graphics, and pixel art. An example prompt is "A large bus sitting next to a very tall building, pencil sketch" where the art style "pencil sketch" was appended to the original prompt. This scenario is used to evaluate the models on the aesthetics aspect.

MS-COCO (fairness – gender). Following [1], we measure the fairness of using male vs. gender terms. We take the original prompts from MS-COCO and map male gender terms to female gender terms (e.g., "son" to "daughter" and "father" to "mother"). An example of this transformation for MS-COCO is "People staring at a man on a fancy motorcycle." is updated to "People staring at a woman on a fancy motorcycle."

MS-COCO (fairness – African-American English dialect). Going from Standard American English to African American English for the GLUE benchmark can lead to a drop in model performance [72]. Following what was done for language models in [1], we measure the fairness for the speaker property of Standard American English vs. African American English for text-to-image models. We take the original prompts from MS-COCO and convert each word to the corresponding word in African American Vernacular English if one exists. For example, the prompt "A birthday cake explicit in nature makes a girl laugh." is transformed to "A birthday cake explicit in nature makes a gurl laugh."

MS-COCO (robustness – typos). Similar to how [1] measured how robust language models are to invariant perturbations, we modify the MS-COCO prompts in a semantic-preserving manner by following these steps:

- 1. Lowercase all letters.
- 2. Replace each expansion with its contracted version (e.g., "She is a doctor, and I am a student" to "She’s a doctor, and I’m a student").
- 3. Replace each word with a common misspelling with 0.1 probability.
- 4. Replace each whitespace with 1, 2, or 3 whitespaces.

For example, the prompt "A horse standing in a field that is genetically part zebra." is transformed to "a horse standing in a field that’s genetically part zebra.", preserving the original meaning of the sentence.

For example, the prompt "A horse standing in a ﬁeld that is genetically part zebra." is transformed to "a horse standing in a ﬁeld that’s genetically part zebra.", preserving the original meaning of the sentence.

MS-COCO (languages). In order to reach a wider audience, it is critical for AI systems to support multiple languages besides English. Therefore, we translate the MS-COCO prompts from English to the three most commonly spoken languages using Google’s Cloud Translation API: Chinese, Spanish, and Hindi. For example, the prompt "A man is serving grilled hot dogs in buns." is translated to:

### C Metric details

#### C.1 Human metrics

We rely on human annotators to evaluate the generated images based on several aspects: alignment, quality, aesthetics, and originality. For quality, we focus on photorealism. For aesthetics, we focus on subject clarity and overall aesthetics of the generated images. The following is the full detail of the human evaluation questions.

To obtain reliable human evaluation results, we employ crowdsourcing methodology in [35]. Concrete word descriptions are provided for each question and rating choice, and a minimum of 5 crowdsource workers evaluate each image. We use at least 100 image samples for each aspect being evaluated. For a more detailed description of the crowdsourcing procedure, see §E.

Overall alignment. We investigate whether the generated image meets the annotators’ expectations by asking them to rate how well the image matches the description using a 5-point Likert scale, similar to [35]:

How well does the image match the description?

- a) Does not match at all
- b) Has significant discrepancies
- c) Has several minor discrepancies
- d) Has a few minor discrepancies
- e) Matches exactly

Photorealism. While photorealism alone does not guarantee superior quality in all contexts, we include it as a measure to assess the basic competence of the text-to-image model. To evaluate photorealism, we employ the HYPE∞ metric [25], where annotators distinguish between real and model-generated images based on 200 samples, with 100 being real and 100 being model-generated. Following [35], below is the multiple-choice question asked of human annotators for both real and generated images:

Determine if the following image is AI-generated or real.

- a) AI-generated photo
- b) Probably an AI-generated photo, but photorealistic
- c) Neutral
- d) Probably a real photo, but with irregular textures and shapes
- e) Real photo

Subject clarity. We assess the subject clarity by evaluating whether the generated image effectively highlights the focal point, following principles commonly shared in art and visual storytelling [68]. We accomplish this by asking annotators to determine if the subject of the image is apparent over a 3-point Likert scale:

Is it clear who the subject(s) of the image is? The subject can be a living being (e.g., a dog or person) or an inanimate body or object (e.g., a mountain).

- a) No, it’s unclear.
- b) I don’t know. It’s hard to tell.

- c) Yes, it’s clear.

Overall aesthetics. For the overall aesthetics, we aim to obtain a holistic assessment of the image’s appeal by asking annotators to rate its aesthetic pleasingness:

How aesthetically pleasing is the image?

- a) I find the image ugly.
- b) The image has a lot of flaws, but it’s not completely unappealing.
- c) I find the image neither ugly nor aesthetically pleasing.
- d) The image is aesthetically pleasing and nice to look at it.
- e) The image is aesthetically stunning. I can look at it all day.

Overall originality. We assess whether the generated images offer a unique interpretation based on the provided description, as this is valued by both creators and audiences. We achieve this by asking annotators to rate the image’s originality given the prompt:

How original is the image, given it was created with the description?

- a) I’ve seen something like this before to the point it’s become tiresome.
- b) The image is not really original, but it has some originality to it.
- c) Neutral.
- d) I find the image to be fresh and original.
- e) I find the image to be extremely creative and out of this world.

#### C.2 Automated metrics

CLIPScore. CLIPScore [24] measures how well an image is aligned with a corresponding natural language description using the pre-trained CLIP model [73]. It is a commonly-used metric for textimage alignment [6].

Fréchet Inception Distance (FID). Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) [23] is a benchmark metric used for evaluating the quality of images generated by models [6, 4, 74]. It quantifies how similar the generated images are to reference images, measured by the Inception Net [75].

To compute the FID, we randomly selected 30,000 text prompts from MS-COCO and generated a single image for each prompt using the text-to-image generation model that we are evaluating. Then, we resized the images to 512×512 and used [76] to compute the FID between the set of real images associated with the prompts and the set of generated images.

Inception score (IS). Inception score (IS) [36] is a benchmark metric used for evaluating the quality of image-based generative models [4, 77]. We follow their settings and compute the IS scores for evaluating the image quality of the generative models. We use the implementation [78] to compute the metric.

LAION Aesthetics. We follow LAION-Aesthetics and use the open-sourced predictor18 for evaluating the aesthetic score of a generated image.

Fractal coefficient. The fractal coefficient is a measure of the fractal patterns in an image, indicating the degree of detail and complexity present at different scales. It can be used to assess the aesthetic quality of images by quantifying their level of visual intricacy and richness [41]. We used the following code snippet to compute the metric: https://gist.github.com/viveksck/ 1110dfca01e4ec2c608515f0d5a5b1d1. We report the absolute difference of the fractal coefficient from 1.4, which is the most aesthetically pleasing to humans according to [41].

Watermark. The unintentional generation of watermarked images poses a risk of trademark and copyright infringement. We use the watermark detector from LAION [40] to determine whether an image contains watermarks.

LAION NSFW. We use the NSFW (not safe for work) classifier from LAION [40] to determine whether an image contains inappropriate content.

NudeNet. In accordance with [8], we employ the pre-trained NudeNet [44] to determine whether an image contains nudity.

Blackout. Stable Diffusion [4] incorporates a module that post-processes images by blacking them out if they are considered inappropriate. This metric represents whether the image has been blacked out.

API rejection. The DALL-E 2 API [3] rejects requests when the provided prompt can lead to the generation of inappropriate content. This metric represents whether the image has been rejected. It pertains specifically to DALL-E 2.

Genderbias. Thismetricassessesthepresenceofbinarygenderbiaswithinasetofimages,following [33, 29]. Specifically, we obtain 8 output images from the model based on a given prompt. For each image, we employ CLIP to compare it against the prompts {“a photo of a male”, “a photo of a female”} and select the gender with the higher probability. The proportion of female representation is then computed among the 8 images. Finally, we calculate the L1 norm distance between this proportion and

- 0.5, which serves as the measure of gender bias.

Skin tone bias. This metric assesses the presence of skin tone bias within a set of images, following [33, 29]. Specifically, we obtain 8 output images from the model based on a given prompt. For each image, we identify skin pixels by analyzing the RGBA and YCrCb color spaces. These skin pixels are then compared to a set of 10 MST (Monk Skin Tone) categories, and the closest category is selected. Using the 8 images, we compute the distribution across the 10 MST skin tone categories, resulting in a vector of length 10. Finally, we calculate the L1 norm distance between this vector and a uniform distribution vector (also length 10), with each value set to 0.1. This calculated error value serves as the measure of skin tone bias.

Fairness. This metric, inspired by [1], assesses changes in model performance (human-rated alignment score and CLIPScore) when the prompt is varied in terms of social groups. For instance, this involves modifying male terms to female terms or incorporating African American dialect into the prompt (see MS-COCO (gender) and MS-COCO (dialect) in §B). A fair model is expected to maintain consistent performance without experiencing a decline in its performance.

Robustness. This metric, inspired by [1], assesses changes in model performance (human-rated alignment score and CLIPScore) when the prompt is perturbed in a semantic-preserving manner, such as injecting typos (see MS-COCO (typos) in §B). A robust model is expected to maintain consistent performance without experiencing a decline in its performance.

Multiliguality. This metric assesses changes in model performance (human-rated alignment score and CLIPScore) when the prompt is translated into non-English languages, such as Spanish, Chinese, and Hindi. We use Google Translate for the translations (see MS-COCO (languages) in §B). A multilingual model is expected to maintain consistent performance without experiencing a decline in its performance.

Inference time. Using APIs introduces performance variability; for example, requests might experience queuing delay or interfere with each other. Consequently, we use two inference runtime metrics to separate out these concerns: raw runtime and a version with this performance variance factored out called the denoised runtime [79].

Object detection. We use the ViTDet [43] object detector with ViT-B [80] backbone and detectron2 [81] library to automatically detect objects specified in the prompts. The object detection metrics

are measured with three skills, similar to DALL-Eval [29]. First, we evaluate the object recognition skill by calculating the average accuracy over N test images, determining whether the object detector accurately identifies the target class from the generated images. Object counting skill is assessed similarly by calculating the average accuracy over N test images and evaluating whether the object detector correctly identifies all M objects of the target class from each generated image. Lastly, spatial relation understanding skill is evaluated based on whether the object detector correctly identifies both target object classes and the pairwise spatial relations between objects. The target class labels, object counts, and spatial relations come from the text prompts used to query the models being evaluated.

### D Model details

Stable Diffusion {v1-4, v1-5, v2-base, v2-1}. Stable Diffusion (v1-4, v1-5, v2-base, v2-1) is a family of 1B-parameter text-to-image models based on latent diffusion [4] trained on LAION [40], a large-scale paired text-image dataset.

Specifically, Stable Diffusion v1-1 was trained 237k steps at resolution 256x256 on laion2B-en and 194k steps at resolution 512x512 on laion-high-resolution (170M examples from LAION-5B with resolution >= 1024x1024). Stable Diffusion v1-2 was initialized with v1-1 and trained 515k steps at resolution 512x512 on laion-aesthetics v2 5+. Stable Diffusion v1-4 is initialized with v1-2 and trained 225k steps at resolution 512x512 on "laion-aesthetics v2 5+" and 10% dropping of the text-conditioning to improve classifier-free guidance sampling. Similarly, Stable Diffusion v1-5 is initialized with v1-2 and trained 595k steps at resolution 512x512 on "laion-aesthetics v2 5+" and 10% dropping of the text-conditioning.

Stable Diffusion v2-base is trained from scratch 550k steps at resolution 256x256 on a subset of LAION-5B filtered for explicit pornographic material, using the LAION-NSFW classifier with punsafe = 0.1 and an aesthetic score >= 4.5. Then it is further trained for 850k steps at resolution 512x512 on the same dataset on images with resolution >= 512x512. Stable Diffusion v2-1 is resumed from Stable diffusion v2-base and finetuned using a v-objective [82] on a filtered subset of the LAION dataset.

### E Human evaluation procedure

#### E.1 Amazon Mechanical Turk

We used the Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) platform to receive human feedback on the AIgenerated images. Following [35], we applied the following filters for worker requirements when creating the MTurk project: 1) Maturity: Over 18 years old and agreed to work with potentially offensive content 2) Master: Good-performing and granted AMT Masters. We required five different annotators per sample. Figure 6 shows the design layout of the survey.

Based on an hourly wage of $16 per hour, each annotator was paid $0.02 for answering a single multiple-choice question. The total amount spent for human annotations was $13,433.55.

#### E.2 Human Subjects Institutional Review Board (IRB)

We submitted a social and behavior (non-medical) human subjects IRB application with the research proposal for this work and details of human evaluation to the Research Compliance Office at Stanford University. The Research Compliance Office deemed that our IRB protocol did not meet the regulatory definition of human subjects research since we did not plan to draw conclusions about humans, nor were we evaluating any characteristics of the human raters. As such, the protocol has been withdrawn, and we were allowed to proceed without any additional IRB review.
