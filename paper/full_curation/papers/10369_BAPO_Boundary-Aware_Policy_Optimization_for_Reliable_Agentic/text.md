### Abstract

RL-based agentic search enables LLMs to solve complex questions via dynamic planning and external search. While this approach significantly enhances accuracy with agent policies optimized via large-scale reinforcement learning, we identify a critical gap in reliability: these agents fail to recognize their reasoning boundaries and rarely admit “I DON’T KNOW” (IDK) even when evidence is insufficient or reasoning reaches its limit. The lack of reliability often leads to plausible but unreliable answers, introducing significant risks in many real-world scenarios. To this end, we propose BoundaryAware Policy Optimization (BAPO), a novel RL framework designed to cultivate reliable boundary awareness without compromising accuracy. BAPO introduces two key components: (i) a group-based boundary-aware reward that encourages an IDK response only when the reasoning reaches its limit, and (ii) an adaptive reward modulator that strategically suspends this reward during early exploration, preventing the model from exploiting IDK as a shortcut. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that BAPO substantially enhances the overall reliability of agentic search1.

### 1 Introduction

Recent advances leverage reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize Large Language Models (LLMs) as autonomous agents that actively plan and execute multi-turn searches (Jin et al., 2025a; Chen et al., 2025; Song et al., 2025). While the RLbased agentic search substantially improves accuracy on complex, knowledge-intensive questions, it introduces a critical reliability issue: these RLbased models almost never admit “I DON’T KNOW”

[Figure 1]

Figure 1: When the agentic search model produces wrong answers, its lengthy and complex reasoning makes it difficult for users to verify. To ensure reliability, the model should explicitly state when information is insufficient and that no answer is available.

(IDK) even when evidence is insufficient or reasoning reaches its limit (Zhang et al., 2025c; Joren et al., 2025). As presented in Figure 1, when an agentic search model cannot reach a concrete final answer, it should explicitly admit IDK rather than fabricating answers. This capability is especially valuable given the difficulty for users to verify the lengthy reasoning process, as honest acknowledgment of IDK helps users seek alternative information sources and prevents misinformation.

Previous research attributes the ability to acknowledge uncertainty to a model’s awareness of its internal “boundary” (Li et al., 2025b; Zhang et al., 2025c). Specifically, EKBM (Zheng et al., 2025) verifies information against its parametric “knowledge boundary” to answer factual questions accurately, while CapBound (Zhang et al., 2025c) introduces a similar concept to determine whether a problem is solvable within its “capability boundary” for mathematical reasoning. However, the reasoning boundary for an agentic search model is inherently more complex and dynamic, as such a boundary is continuously shaped by the interplay between the model’s internal reasoning capacity for search tool interaction

and the external retrieved information.

To investigate the impact of RL on an agentic search model’s awareness of its reasoning boundaries, we conduct preliminary experiments measuring this awareness before and after RL training. A key finding is that while RL optimization improves accuracy on complex questions, it significantly degrades the model’s awareness of its boundary. This occurs because standard RL rewards incentivize exhaustive exploration for correctness while simultaneously discouraging any acknowledgment of uncertainty (Jin et al., 2025a; Song et al., 2025). As a result, these models often lack awareness of their boundaries and fabricate plausible answers.

Enhancing the boundary awareness of agentic search models is crucial but challenging. (i) It is difficult to quantitatively measure a model’s reasoning boundary, which makes it hard to construct a reliable reward signal for IDK responses. Unlike static knowledge or capability boundaries, which are tied solely to the model’s inherent competencies, the boundary of an agentic search model is a dynamic, emergent property of the interaction between the agent’s planning, the quality of its retrievals, and its iterative reasoning steps. Consequently, we lack a robust strategy to measure whether the agent has genuinely encountered its limit. (ii) It is challenging to integrate such a signal into the RL objective without creating unintended incentives. A naive reward that encourages IDK responses could be exploited as a low-effort shortcut, especially on difficult problems requiring deep exploration. If the reward function prioritizes IDK over incorrect answers, the model may learn to default to IDK prematurely, ultimately harming the reasoning accuracy and exploration depth.

To this end, we propose Boundary-Aware Policy Optimization (BAPO) for agentic search, designed to cultivate reliable self-awareness without compromising accuracy. Our research aims to address two fundamental research questions: (i) how to precisely model the learning signal for identifying the boundary of agentic search models, and (ii) how to integrate this signal into an RL framework to balance deep exploration and appropriate exploitation. Results across four challenging benchmarks demonstrate that BAPO consistently outperforms mainstream training-based and prompt-based methods in overall reliability. Remarkably, with only 5000 RL training samples, BAPO with Qwen2.57B-Instruct shows superior reliability compared to strong open-source agentic search models, without

compromising average accuracy. Our major contributions are listed as follows:

- • We identify the key limitation of agentic search models and propose BAPO, a novel RL framework that dynamically rewards IDK responses to cultivate the model’s selfawareness of its reasoning boundaries.
- • BAPO introduces a group-based boundaryaware reward that encourages an IDK response only when the question is out of the model’s boundary, and an adaptive reward modulator to prevent reward hacking.
- • Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks demonstrate that BAPO effectively enhances search reliability while preserving the model’s ability to solve complex problems.

### 2 Background

#### 2.1 Agentic Search

To enhance response quality in knowledgeintensive scenarios, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) supplements LLMs’ parametric knowledge with external search (Lewis et al., 2020; Gao

- et al., 2023; Fan et al., 2024). Current promptingbased strategies often depend on predefined workflows for interleaving reasoning and search (Asai
- et al., 2024; Li et al., 2025c), resulting in limited effectiveness. While learning-based methods (SFT/DPO) offer an alternative (Lin et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2025; Fang et al., 2025; Li et al., 2025d), they remain constrained by complex data pipelines and suboptimal generalization.

Inspired by the success of reinforcement learning on mathematics and coding (Jaech et al., 2024; DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025), RL-based agentic search systems have emerged, such as SearchR1 (Jin et al., 2025a), ReSearch (Chen et al., 2025), R1-Searcher (Song et al., 2025), and ToolStar (Dong et al., 2025). These methods employ format and outcome correctness rewards to enable autonomous query decomposition and flexible interaction with external search systems during reasoning, thereby achieving superior accuracy on complex queries. Nevertheless, current methods prioritize search accuracy while ignoring holistic reliability, which depends on both accuracy and precision. In contrast, our proposed BAPO leverages boundary-aware reward mechanisms to optimize overall reliability, thereby maximizing the practicality of agentic search models.

- 2.2 Formalization To make it clear, we formally define Agentic Search

- as a sequential decision-making process following the ReAct paradigm (Yao et al., 2023). Given a query x, the agent aims to generate a trajectory τ that concludes with a final answer y. To structure this reasoning process, a system prompt is included to constrain the model’s output format. For instance, the model is required to use tags <think>, <search>, and <answer> to indicate thoughts, search tool calls, and the predicted answers, respectively, with search results returned in <result>. The prompt template is detailed in Appendix C.1. As formalized below, the trajectory τ is a sequence of interleaved reasoning steps, actions, and observations:

τ = (rt,at,ot)Tt=1−1,rT,y , (1)

where each rt denotes the reasoning state at step t that plans subsequent actions and rT synthesizes accumulated information to conclude to the final answer y; at is the search action; and ot is the returned search results.

As RL has demonstrated significant efficacy in enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) (Shao et al.,

- 2024) has been extensively employed in training agentic search models (Jin et al., 2025a; Chen et al., 2025; Dong et al., 2025). For a query x, a group

of G trajectories {τ1,τ2,...,τG} is sampled from the policy, and the objective function is defined as:

J (θ) = Ex∼D,{τ

i}Gi=1∼πθold(·|x)

1 G

G

i=1

(2)

[min(wi(θ)Ai,clip(wi(θ),1 − ϵ,1 + ϵ)Ai)],

where wi(θ) = ππθ(τi|x)

θold(τi|x) and the KL term against a reference model is omitted. The advantage Ai is computed by normalizing the rewards within the

group, Ai = R(τi)−mean({R(τj)}

G j=1)

std({R(τj)}Gj=1) . Rule-based rewards have demonstrated robust empirical performance and are widely adopted in current research (Song et al., 2025; Chen et al.,

- 2025). Typical reward design focuses on correctness and consists of two parts: (i) a format correctness reward that checks whether the output conforms to the prescribed structure across reasoning steps, tool calls, and answers; and (ii) an outcome correctness reward that measures the objective cor-

rectness of the final answer.

where F1 means character-level F1 score between two strings, y is the prediction answer extracted from trajectory and yˆ is the ground truth answer.

### 3 Preliminary Study

In this study, we first investigate the impact of RL training with correctness-based reward on the boundary awareness of agentic search models. Subsequently, we incorporate an additional reward term designed to encourage IDK responses and evaluate its effect. Our findings reveal an inherent trade-off between maximizing accuracy and maintaining effective boundary awareness.

#### 3.1 Setup

Training. For training, we use a high-quality RL training dataset from Dong et al. (2025), comprising 5000 multi-hop QA samples from HotpotQA and 2WikiMultihopQA. Following the coldstart-free paradigm, we directlt apply GRPO to Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct (Yang et al., 2025b), bypassing preliminary in-domain SFT.

Evaluation. For evaluation, we use four multihop QA benchmarks: HotpotQA (Yang et al., 2018), MuSiQue (Trivedi et al., 2022), 2WikiMultiHopQA (Ho et al., 2020), and Bamboogle (Press et al., 2023). Specifically, HotpotQA, 2WikiMultiHopQA and MuSiQue are constructed from Wikipedia or Wikidata (Vrandeˇci´c and Krötzsch, 2014) using diverse multi-hop mining strategies, while Bamboogle is a manually curated dataset of 2-hop challenging questions. Following the setup in Dong et al. (2025), we construct a validation set of 80 multi-hop QA pairs, comprising 20 examples from the test set of each benchmark. In contrast, the results reported in Section 5 are evaluated on the complete test sets.

Metrics. To comprehensively evaluate model reliability, we follow Xu et al. (2024) to use three following metrics: accuracy (acc), precision (prec) and IDK rate (ρIDK). These metrics are defined as follows:

acc =

Nc N

Nc N − Nr

,prec =

,ρIDK =

Nr N

, (4)

[Figure 2]

- Figure 2: Evaluation results of accuracy, precision and IDK rate (ρIDK) of models before and after RL. The sharp drop in ρIDK coupled with the narrowing gap between accuracy and precision, indicates a diminished boundary awareness after RL.

[Figure 3]

- Figure 3: Left: Validation accuracy under different reward settings during RL training. Right: IDK rate (ρIDK) under the modified reward during RL training.

where N = Nc + Nw + Nr is the total number of answers, with Nc, Nw, Nr denoting the number of correct answers, wrong answers and IDK answers, respectively. Following previous studies (Chen et al., 2025; Dong et al., 2025), we extract answers from the model output enclosed in \box{}, and then use GPT-4 as a judge to assess the correctness (Appendix C.2).

- 3.2 RL with Correctness Reward Impairs Boundary Awareness

To evaluate the impact of RL on boundary awareness, we compare Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct with its variant, ReSearch-Qwen-7B-Instruct (Chen et al., 2025), which is optimized via GRPO using a correctness-based reward. To elicit explicit IDK admissions, we follow Xu et al. (2024) to append the following reliable prompt to the original one:

Reliable Prompt

If you can’t solve this question by the reasoning process, you should output \boxed{I DON’T KNOW}.

As illustrated in Figure 2, before RL training, Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct shows a notable precision advantage over its accuracy (50.76 vs. 41.25), accompanied by a substantial IDK rate of 18.75%, effectively filtering uncertain cases. However, after RL training (ReSearch-Qwen-7B-Instruct), while accuracy improves to 51.25, IDK rate drops sharply to 3.65%, and precision increases only marginally to 53.24. This indicates a weakened boundary awareness that suppresses IDK admission.

- 3.3 Encouraging IDK Responses Hinders Accuracy Advancement

Since correctness-based rewards alone weaken the model’s awareness of when to acknowledge IDK, a natural approach is to incorporate appropriate positive rewards for IDK responses during RL training. Following the training setting in Section 3.1, we instruct the model with reliable prompt and modify the correctness reward function by assigning an additional reward of 0.5 to IDK responses within rollout groups that lacks correct answers. This design prioritizes IDK responses over incorrect answers when a correct answer is unavailable.

However, as shown in Figure 3, directly incentivizing IDK responses leads to reward hacking: the model learns to maximize rewards by defaulting to IDK rather than attempting to solve challenging problems. Consequently, this modified reward impedes accuracy gains compared to the vanilla reward. This finding underscores a fundamental challenge in training reliable models: balancing the model’s exploration for correctness rewards against its exploitation for IDK rewards.

4 The Framework of BAPO

With observations and insights from the preliminary study, we propose Boundary-Aware Policy Optimization (BAPO), an RL algorithm built upon GRPO for training reliable agentic search models. As shown in Figure 4, BAPO uses boundaryaware reward to encourage IDK responses according to whether a problem is out of model’s boundary. More importantly, it uses an adaptive reward modulator to balance exploration and exploitation, mitigating the reward hacking issue identified in Section 3.3.

- 4.1 Boundary-Aware Reward

We regard that a question exceeds the model’s boundary if the model fails to get any correct

[Figure 4]

- Figure 4: The overall framework of BAPO. Its training process begins with (a) agentic reasoning, where the model generates a group of rollouts for each question by interleaving thought processes with search environment interactions. These rollouts are then passed to the (b) reward computation module, which is comprised of (b.1) correctness reward RCorrect derived from the correctness of format and outcome, (b.2) boundary-aware reward RIDK designed to incentivize IDK responses when no correct rollout exists within the group, and (b.3) adaptive reward modulator adaptively disabling RIDK based on IDK ratio at the exploration stage and diversity of rollouts

- at the plateau stage.

answer among multiple rollouts. In this situation, we adjust the reward assignment for IDK responses. Formally, for a set of rollout outputs {τi}Gi=1 and their corresponding correctness rewards {RCorrecti }Gi=1, the boundary-aware reward is calculated as:

RIDK = 0.5 · I(yi = IDK), if ∀{RCorrect(τi)}Gi=1 ≤ 0.

(5)

The final reward R is the sum of RCorrect and RIDK: R = RIDK + RCorrect. (6)

#### 4.2 Adaptive Reward Modulator

Our preliminary analysis suggests that purely incentivizing IDK responses leads to a degradation in exploration. To balance exploration and boundary awareness during RL training, we introduce an adaptive reward modulator for RIDK, which functions at two distinct levels:

Stage Level. In the early stages of training, the model needs to conduct extensive exploration to learn how to solve tasks. During this exploration stage, we avoid introducing additional rewards to interfere with the model’s learning. RIDK is deactivated by default and only activated when the proportion of IDK responses RIDK falls below α. As

training progresses, the task accuracy gradually stabilizes. At this plateau stage, we apply the reward RIDK fully to make the model start paying more attention to its boundary awareness. Some difficult queries may not be easily answered correctly or admitted as unknown under the default group size, and thus we dynamically resample groups with no correct rollouts up to k times, until the model outputs IDK or provides a correct answer. The transition between the exploration and plateau stages is determined by the stagnation of the validation score, e.g., when the validation score plateaus for 5 consecutive steps.

Sample Level. The consistency of a model’s generated responses can serve as a proxy for its confidence. To further preserve the model’s exploration during the plateau stage, we adaptively modulate RIDK based on the rollout diversity of each query. Specifically, for queries exhibiting high rollout diversity, indicating that the model is actively exploring the solution space, we deactivate RIDK to prevent untimely convergence. In contrast, for samples with low rollout diversity, which signifies that the model has converged on a specific output, RIDK is applied to refine its boundary awareness. Formally, a sample is considered to have high rollout diversity

if its corresponding rollout answers |{y1...G}| ≥ G2 ; otherwise, it is categorized as having low diversity.

### 5 Experiments

#### 5.1 Experimental Setups

Baselines. We compare BAPO against (1) existing RL agentic search methods, and (2) our implementations of prompting and training-based methods. For the former, we select two representative approaches: Search-R1 (Jin et al., 2025a) and ReSearch (Chen et al., 2025). We use Qwen2.5-7BInstruct as the backbone for a fair comparison. The prompt-based baselines include: (1) Naive RAG: A naive retrieval-based approach that directly concatenates retrieved context with the query. (2) IRCoT (Trivedi et al., 2023): An interleaving method where retrieval and CoT mutually guide each other. (3) TIR Prompt (Dong et al., 2025): a standard toolintegrated prompt, which instructs the model to use search tools during reasoning (Appendix C). (4) Reliable TIR Prompt: Building on TIR Prompt, it additionally encourages the model to acknowledge ignorance by responding with IDK (Section 3.2). For training-based baselines, we choose (1) Reliable Rejection Sampling Fine-Tuning (Reliable RFT), which generates multiple reasoning paths for each question under Reliable TIR Prompt, and incorporates both correct paths and reasonable IDK responses into the SFT dataset. Similar to BAPO, an IDK response is adopted when no correct path is available. (2) GRPO (Shao et al., 2024), which uses only the correctness reward, with other settings matching those of BAPO.

Reliability Metric. We follow Xu et al. (2024) to adopt a reliability metric to comprehensively balance accuracy and precision:

reliability = (1 − ρIDK) · prec + ρIDK · acc, (7)

where ρIDK denotes the IDK rate. This metric functions as a dynamic interpolation between precision and accuracy based on the model’s tendency to refuse. Specifically, when the agent rarely refuses to give an answer (low ρIDK), the metric prioritizes precision, enforcing strict correctness on generated answers. Conversely, as the agent tends to refuse more frequently (high ρIDK), the metric shifts focus toward standard accuracy . This mechanism effecively penalizes excessive “lazy” IDK.

Implementation Details. Regarding BAPOspecific hyper-parameters, we set the IDK ratio

threshold α as 5%, and the resampling times k is set to 2. The retrieval environment is based on FlashRAG (Jin et al., 2025b). We use E5base-v2 (Wang et al., 2024) as the retriever and Wikipedia data (Vrandeˇci´c and Krötzsch, 2014) from December 2018 as the knowledge base. During training and evaluation, we retrieve top-5 results for each query. We train the GRPO and BAPO models with a batch size of 64 for 2 epochs. The rollout size is set to 8, and the maximum tokens are set to 8192. The maximum number of tool invocations during training and inference is set to 3. Sensitivity analysis of the hyper-parameters are present in Appendix B.1.

#### 5.2 Main Results

The performance of BAPO and other baselines conducted on Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct is presented in Table 1. Compared to all methods from both existing agentic search and our implemented baselines, BAPO achieves significant reliability improvements across all benchmarks (+15.8 scores in average). Notably, compared to existing agentic search models such as Search-R1 (Jin et al., 2025a) and ReSearch (Chen et al., 2025), which utilize large-scale training sets of 90k and 19k samples respectively, BAPO-trained model with only 5k samples achieves competitive accuracy and substantially higher reliability.

When compared to GRPO, BAPO achieves average improvements in reliability of 9.7%, with corresponding precision improvements of 11.8%, while incurring only marginal accuracy decreases of 2.2%. These results showcase BAPO’s effectiveness and efficiency in training reliable agents.

Regarding methods with reliable techniques, such as Reliable RFT and Reliable TIR Prompt, we find that Reliable RFT tends to be overconservative; although they achieve significant gains in precision, this come at the cost of a drastic decline in accuracy, suffering a 27-point accuracy drop compared to the TIR Prompt baseline. This ultimately undermines overall reliability. While Reliable TIR Prompt enhances precision without sacrificing accuracy, it inherently lacks the capacity to further improve problem-solving capability. On the contrary, BAPO achieves both boundary awareness and problem-solving capability.

#### 5.3 Generalization Across Model Scales

To verify BAPO’s generalization across different model scales, we extend our evaluation to the 3B

#### 5.4 Ablation Study

Table 3 details the ablation study on Qwen2.53B-Instruct comparing BAPO with its variants. Through the experiments results, we can draw the following observations:

Fixed Reward Strategy Leads to Reward Hacking. When replacing our proposed reward mechanism with a fixed positive reward of 0.5 for IDK responses, which simulates the setting used in BARREL (Yang et al., 2025a), the model exhibits extreme over-conservatism. The IDK rate spikes to 53.1%; while this boosts precision, it drastically reduces accuracy and yields the lowest overall reliability score among all variants.

Adaptive Reward Modulator is Critical. Next, we ablate the two components of the Adaptive Reward Modulator to verify their effectiveness. We find that removing sample-level deactivation results in a mild degradation in reliability (−1.2). In contrast, removing both the stage-level and samplelevel modulators causes the model to degenerate into a local optimum where it exploits IDK responses. Consequently, we observe an excessive surge in the IDK rate (16.8% → 35.2%), accompanied by significant drops in accuracy (44.8 → 37.8) and reliability (51.3 → 49.0).

and 14B versions of the Qwen2.5-Instruct series. As shown in Table 2, BAPO improves the reliability of its instruct model backbones with Reliable TIR Prompt by an average of 76.1% and 27.4% on the 3B and 14B scales, respectively. Furthermore, compared to the standard GRPO baseline, BAPO achieves substantial reliability advantages of 13.9% and 11.9%. These results are consistent with our main experiments, confirming that BAPO is generalizable for building reliable agentic search.

#### 5.5 Reward Dynamics of Two Stage

In Figure 5, we visualize BAPO’s training dynamics of the average correctness reward RCorrect and the average boundary-aware reward RIDK, along with the IDK ratio ρIDK across different stages on Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct. At the exploration stage (the first 60 steps), RCorrect increases from 0.3 to

[Figure 5]

[Figure 6]

Figure 5: Upper: Dynamics of correctness reward RCorrect and boundary-aware reward RIDK. Bottom: Dynamics of IDK ratio ρIDK during BAPO training on Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct.

0.5 at the first 60 steps, with ρIDK drops from the initial 20% to 5%, indicating that the model prioritizes acquiring problem-solving skills over boundary awareness. In the plateau stage, the growth of RCorrect slows down, whereas RIDK rises quickly and stabilizes between 0.25 and 0.3. This shift drives a sustained increase in the IDK rate, eventually restoring ρIDK to over 25%.

These dynamics revel that our adaptive reward mechanism effectively varies the main optimization goals across training stages, thereby preventing RCorrect and RIDK from hampering each other. It achieves a superior balance between solving problems and refusing unknown questions.

#### 5.6 Awareness of When to Refuse

To assess the rationality of IDK responses produced by BAPO, we use rejection success rate, defined as the error rate of the GRPO-trained model on the subset of problems where the BAPO-trained model refuses to give a final answer by responding with IDK:

rejection success rate = |SrefuseBAPO ∩ SfailGRPO|

, (8)

|SrefuseBAPO|

where SrefuseBAPO = {x ∈ D | MBAPO(x) = IDK} and SfailGRPO = {x ∈ D | MGRPO(x) ̸= yˆ}. To

[Figure 7]

Figure 6: Rejection success rates calculated on Qwen2.5-Instruct series models.

mitigate randomness, we adopt the results of bestof-N (with N=5) as the criterion for determining failures and refusals.

Given that the GRPO-trained model acts as the upper bound of problem-solving capability under our settings, if a problem triggering a refusal is also unsolvable by GRPO, this suggests that the BAPOtrained model’s refusal reflects a precise awareness of its reasoning boundaries. Figure 6 shows that the BAPO-trained models attain robust average rejection success rates of 74.7% (3B), 76.7% (7B), and 76.7% (14B). This validates BAPO’s ability to enhance model self-awareness, ensuring the appropriate rejection of queries lying outside their reasoning scope. Besides that, it is worth noting that the rejection success rate does not grow with model size, primarily since the overall error rate of the GRPO baselines simultaneously decreases as the model size scales.

### 6 Conclusion

In this paper, we reveal a critical challenge that RL training with only correctness rewards undermines the model’s reliability in providing truthful answers to users. To this end, we propose BAPO, a novel RL algorithm for training reliable agentic search models. Beyond correctness rewards, BAPO incorporates boundary-aware rewards to encourage appropriate IDK responses. To tackle the tradeoff between exploration and exploitation, we introduce an adaptive reward modulator to prevent the model from being over-encouraged to admit ignorance. Extensive experiments show that BAPO achieves superior reliability, enabling the model to maintain awareness of its reasoning boundaries without compromising its capability for deep exploration.

### Limitations

Despite the promising results of BAPO in enhancing agentic search model’s reliability, our work has several limitations. First, our evaluation primarily focuses on knowledge-intensive tasks. Consequently, the study leaves the generalizability of our method to other types of reasoning problems to be fully explored. Furthermore, constrained by computational resources, our experiments currently scale only up to models with 14B parameters. It remains to be seen how the proposed method performs on larger-scale LLMs. Finally, due to the high costs of commercial search APIs, we only consider a local RAG setup. While this ensures reproducibility, it does not fully replicate the noise, and dynamic nature of web search, which may present additional challenges for reliability.

### A Implementation Details

#### A.1 Details of GRPO

We implement GRPO algorithm based on the verl2 framework. The details of training parameters are listed in Table 4.

Hyper-Parameter Value

Learning Rate 1e-6 LR Scheduler Constent Batch Size 64 Mini Batch Size 16 Training Epochs 2 Number of Rollout 8 Rollout Temperature 1.0 KL Loss Coefficient 0.001 Clip Ratio (ϵ) 0.1 Max Tokens 8192

Table 4: Training hyper-parameters setting of GRPO.

Consistent with previous agentic search models like Search-R1 and Tool-Star, we exclud all tool invocation results from the loss computation to avoid biasing the policy toward tool outputs. Only tokens from the text-based reasoning process and tool requests are considered during loss calculation. For fair comparison, all non-BAPO-specific parameters are set to match the standard GRPO configuration.

#### A.2 Details of Reliable RFT

As a variant of Rejection Sampling Fine-tuning (RFT), Reliable RFT aims to move beyond pure accuracy maximization and optimize the model to admit uncertainty in the fine-tuning process. We use the same training dataset as in the implementation of BAPO. For RFT data construction, we perform rollouts with 8 samples per question using a sampling temperature of 1.0. For each question, if no correct answer exists across the rollouts, we adopt the model’s IDK response (if available); otherwise, we select the correct response(s) for training. We use LLaMA-Factory3 training framework for conducting experiments. The training hyperparameters are listed in Table 5.

#### A.3 Details of Open-source Models

For a fair comparison, we directly use the released checkpoint of open-source models trained from Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and follow the corresponding

prompts in the original work to ensure the reproducibility of the results.

Search-R1 (Jin et al., 2025a) is a reinforcement learning framework that trains a model to autonomously invoke search engines during the reasoning process. Its reward is determined solely by the correctness of the final answer. The training dataset is a unified dataset merging Natural Questions (NQ) and HotpotQA, amounting to approximately 90k training samples.

ReSearch (Chen et al., 2025) is another framework designed to enable agentic search capabilities of LLMs. Its reward function incorporates both the prediction F1 score and format correctness. Models are trained using the MuSiQue training set, which comprises 19,938 samples.

#### A.4 Dataset Details

For training BAPO, we utilize the high-quality dataset introduced by (Dong et al., 2025)4. This training dataset is specifically constructed to be challenging for both Direct Reasoning and ToolIntegrated Reasoning. To target agentic search capabilities, we isolate the QA portion of this dataset. This yields 5,000 training samples derived from HotpotQA and 2WikiMultiHopQA.

#### A.5 Benchmark Details

For evaluation, we use four benchmarks of multihop QA tasks: HotpotQA (Yang et al., 2018), MuSiQue (Trivedi et al., 2022), 2WikiMultiHopQA (Ho et al., 2020), and Bamboogle (Press et al., 2023). Following the setup in Dong et al. (2025), the full test set consists of 200 test samples from HotpotQA, 200 from 2WikiMultiHopQA, 200 from MuSiQue, and 125 from Bamboogle.

Figure 7: Accuracy of the Pass@K on Qwen2.5-7BInstruct for different values of K. The accuracy improves with increasing K and stabilizes after K = 32.

### B Additional Experiments

#### B.1 Hyper-Parameters Sensitivity Analysis

To investigate the impact of the values of BAPO’s specific hyper-parameters IDK ratio α and resampling times k, we systematically evaluate model’s performance under different hyper-parameter settings, while keeping all other hyper-parameters fixed to the default settings used in the main experiments. All experiments are conducted on Qwen2.53B-Instruct, and the results are reported in Table 6.

This hyper-parameters analysis reveals these key observations: (1) The value of α is closely tied to the model’s tendency to acknowledge uncertainty. Since α directly controls the strength of the reward assigned to IDK responses, when α = 0, the model is never encouraged to produce IDK responses in the early stage. As a result, the model has lost the ability to generate IDK responses in exploration stage and can no longer learn this behavior in plateau stage. In contrast, larger values of α promote more IDK responses during the exploration stage, enabling the model to cultivate boundary awareness. (2) The resampling times k allows us to dynamically enlarge the effective rollout size by repeatedly sampling within groups that contain no rewardable responses, thereby improving overall reliability. Increasing k from 1 to 2 yields clear gains, while further increasing k to 3 provides only marginal improvement, indicating that moderate resampling times is sufficient.

#### B.2 Why We Resample Rollouts

The resampling strategy is premised on the assumption that increasing the rollout size yields a more

accurate estimation of the model’s boundary. As illustrated in Figure 7, the model shows no further improvement in pass@K accuracy as K increases to 32. This indicates that failure stems from the problem lying beyond the reasoning boundary, rather than merely being an accidental failure to sample a correct solution. Consequently, our dynamic resampling design adaptively expands the group size to refine this boundary estimation. The results in Table 6 corroborate our findings, demonstrating that pass@24 to pass@32 (corresponding to resampling factors k = 2 and k = 3 with a rollout size of 8) are sufficient for accurate estimation.

#### B.3 Exact Match Performance

As a complement of the main experiment results based on LLM-as-a-Judge Equal (LE), we report the performance under the Exact Match (EM) metric in Table 7. Consistent with the LLM-based findings, models trained with BAPO achieve the highest reliability across the 3B, 7B, and 14B model scales. These results further demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of BAPO in developing reliable agents.

#### B.4 Case Study

Table 9 and Table 10 represent the reasoning process of Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct trained with GRPO and BAPO, respectively. When the retrieved results lack relevant information, the GRPO-trained model initially identifies the absence of necessary information and attempts to search for it. However, it subsequently hallucinates that the director is Ralph Pappier, resulting in an erroneous final outcome. In contrast, BAPO enables the model to recognize its

- B.5 Detailed Analysis of Uncertainty Estimation Methods

Although uncertainty estimation methods have proven effective in standard QA or math reasoning tasks (Chen and Mueller, 2024; Kuhn et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2025c), their effectiveness remains unexplored in agentic search scenario. In this section, we systematically evaluate three distinct uncertainty estimation methods: 1) Internal Confi-

dence based on token probabilities, 2) Expression Certainty measuring confidence via the model’s verbalized expressions, and 3) Self-Reflection utilizing the model’s self-verification capabilities. The implementation details are as follows:

- • Internal Confidence. Model confidence is conventionally quantified via the probability distribution of its output (Kuhn et al., 2023; Kumar et al., 2024). In our approach, we adopt the average log-probability as the proxy for internal confidence.
- • Expression Certainty. To assess uncertainty based on model’s expression, we follow Zhang et al. (2025c) to calculate the proportion of confident versus uncertain expressions within the reasoning trajectory. Specifically, we utilize a predefined lexicon of confident and uncertain phrases (as illustrated in Figure 8), which are manually curated and subsequently verified by an LLM. We quantify the degree of certainty as the ratio of confident expressions to uncertain expressions.
- • Self-Reflection. Leveraging the inherent capacity of LLMs for self-reflection (Manakul et al., 2023; Madaan et al., 2023), we use a prompt-based self-reflection approach to instruct the model to retrospectively audit its own reasoning trajectory to identify potential

logical pitfalls. The specific prompt utilized for this verification is detailed in Section C.3.

For Internal Confidence and Expression Certainty, we apply a percentile-based thresholding method: responses ranked within the bottom x ∈ [0,1] of confidence scores across the dataset are classified as IDK. For Self-Reflection, we rely on the model’s judgment, where any response flagged as uncertain by the LLM is directly labeled as IDK.

As shown in Table 8, although employing these methods improves precision, it comes at the cost of a substantial drop in accuracy, resulting in negligible gains or even degradation in reliability. This underscores a critical challenge in agentic search scenario: the validity of reasoning is inextricably linked to the quality of retrieved content. This external dependency induces a decoupling between the actual reachability of the answer and the model’s internal or explicit uncertainty signals, thereby limiting the effectiveness of standard estimation paradigms. It is important to note that uncertainty estimation methods do not cultivate model’s inherent capability to explicitly admit IDK, which often leads to a significant discrepancy between the reasoning process and the final answer.

- D.1 Agentic Search

To enhance response quality in knowledgeintensive scenarios, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) (Lewis et al., 2020; Gao et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2025b) supplements LLMs’ parametric knowledge with external search (Fan et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2025a; Xiang et al., 2025; Zhuang et al., 2025). Current prompting-based strategies often depend on predefined workflows for interleaving reasoning and search (Asai et al.,

- 2024; Li et al., 2025c), resulting in limited effectiveness. While learning-based methods (SFT/DPO) offer an alternative (Lin et al., 2024; Wang et al.,
- 2025; Fang et al., 2025; Li et al., 2025d,a), they remain constrained by complex data pipelines and suboptimal generalization.

Inspired by the success of reinforcement learning on mathematics and coding (Jaech et al., 2024; DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025), RL-based agentic search systems have emerged, such as SearchR1 (Jin et al., 2025a), ReSearch (Chen et al., 2025), R1-Searcher (Song et al., 2025), and ToolStar (Dong et al., 2025). These methods employ format and outcome correctness rewards to enable autonomous query decomposition and flexible interaction with external search systems during reasoning, thereby achieving superior accuracy on complex queries. Nevertheless, current methods prioritize search accuracy while ignoring holistic reliability, which depends on both accuracy and precision. In contrast, our proposed BAPO leverages boundary-aware reward mechanisms to optimize overall reliability, thereby maximizing the practicality of agentic search models.

quantify prediction confidence through token probabilities and consistency across diverse outputs (Manakul et al., 2023; Chen and Mueller, 2024). Alternatively, calibration strategies such as prompting (Tian et al., 2023) and fine-tuning (Tao et al., 2024) are employed to align model confidence with accuracy. Recently, Zhang et al. (2025c) find that reasoning models exhibit self-awareness regarding their capability boundaries and proposed test-time monitoring strategies to terminate unproductive reasoning for unsolvable questions. Distinctly, our work focuses on activating the model’s intrinsic boundary awareness through RL, which is orthogonal to these uncertainty-based methods.

Sharing this focus on model’s internal capacity to refuse queries out of its answerable boundary, Xu et al. (2024), Chen et al. (2024) and Sun et al. (2025) develop specialized reward models by constructing preference pairs of refusal and standard responses for subsequent RL training. KnowRL (Ren et al., 2025) incorporates a fact-level verification reward into RL to improve factual accuracy, yet it remains dependent on manually curated factual databases. BARREL (Yang et al., 2025a) fine-tunes models on distilled reasoning traces that align with

expected patterns, followed by RL training with a static medium-level reward for uncertain responses. However, our empirical findings suggest that such static reward leads to excessively high rejection rates, thereby impairs accuracy. Unlike prior work, our approach targets the agentic search scenario, which is characterized by a sophisticated synergy between reasoning and search tool interaction.

#### D.3 Policy Optimization

DeepSeek-R1 (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025) shows that RL with formatting and result-only rewards can steer LLMs toward complex chain-of-thought reasoning, boosting performance on challenging tasks. Subsequently, Search-R1 (Jin et al., 2025a) and TORL (Li et al., 2025e) explored extending this R1-style approach to tool use. However, to accommodate diverse training requirements, various RL variants have been proposed to adaptively adjust training objectives and task difficulty (Zhang et al., 2025d; Tian et al., 2025; Yang et al., 2026; Ma et al., 2026; Sun et al., 2026). Unlike prior work, our proposed BAPO aims to balance two conflicting rewards by introducing a stage-based adaptive reward modulator, thereby achieving an equilib-

rium between the model’s boundary awareness and problem-solving capabilities during training.

### E The Use of Large Language Models

In preparing this paper, we made limited use of Large Language Models (LLMs). Specifically, LLMs were employed for two purposes: (i) to aid in polishing the writing by improving grammar, readability, and clarity without altering the scientific content, and (ii) to assist in retrieval and discovery tasks, such as identifying and organizing related work. No LLMs were used for generating novel research ideas, designing experiments, or analyzing results. All conceptual and technical contributions presented in this paper are the sole work of the authors.
