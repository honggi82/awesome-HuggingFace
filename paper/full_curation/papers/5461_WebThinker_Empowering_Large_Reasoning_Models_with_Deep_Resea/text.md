### Abstract

Large reasoning models (LRMs), such as OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1, demonstrate impressive long-horizon reasoning capabilities. However, their reliance on static internal knowledge limits their performance on complex, knowledge-intensive tasks and hinders their ability to produce comprehensive research reports requiring synthesis of diverse web information. To address this, we propose WebThinker, a deep research agent that empowers LRMs to autonomously search the web, navigate among web pages, and draft reports during the reasoning process. WebThinker integrates a Deep Web Explorer module, enabling LRMs to dynamically search, navigate, and extract information from the web when encountering knowledge gaps. It also employs an Autonomous Think-Search-and-Draft strategy, allowing the model to seamlessly interleave reasoning, information gathering, and report writing in real time. To further enhance research tool utilization, we introduce an RL-based training strategy via iterative online Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Extensive experiments on complex reasoning benchmarks (GPQA, GAIA, WebWalkerQA, HLE) and scientific report generation tasks (Glaive) demonstrate that WebThinker significantly outperforms existing methods and strong proprietary systems. Our approach enhances LRM reliability and applicability in complex scenarios, paving the way for more capable and versatile deep research systems.

### 1 Introduction

Recently, large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various domains like math, code, and science [34, 48, 14]. However, when confronted with complex information research needs, models that rely solely on internal knowledge struggle to conduct in-depth web information retrieval and to generate comprehensive and accurate reports through multi-step reasoning. Therefore, the deep integration of LRMs’ reasoning capabilities with web information exploration has become a practical demand, which has sparked a series of deep research initiatives by OpenAI [35], xAI Grok3 [12], and Google Gemini [10].

The objective of deep research technology is quite revolutionary: enabling users to conduct deep searches, mining, and integration of comprehensive and reliable research information across the internet’s massive information landscape through simple queries. This approach significantly reduces the time and costs associated with information gathering for researchers in knowledge-intensive fields (e.g., finance, science, engineering).

Unfortunately, existing open-source deep search agents typically employ retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques with predefined workflows [1, 63, 42], which limits LRMs’ ability to explore deeper web information and hinders close interaction between LRMs and search engines (Figure 2 (a) & (b)). Consequently, developing a universal, flexible, open-source deep research framework has emerged as a critical challenge urgently awaiting resolution in both academic and industrial circles.

To address this, we propose WebThinker, an autonomous deep research agent entirely powered by large reasoning models, as illustrated in Figure 2 (c). It enables LRMs to autonomously conduct web searches and web page navigation to acquire external knowledge during the reasoning process, facilitating complex real-world problem solving. Furthermore, WebThinker allows LRMs to draft reports concurrently with thinking and searching. Once sufficient information is gathered for a specific section, the model can draft that part, ultimately producing comprehensive and customized reports tailored to users’ research questions.

To empower LRMs with the capability to deeply explore web information, we design a Deep Web Explorer module that enables LRMs to search, navigate pages by clicking interactive elements (like links or buttons), and extract relevant information. Based on the current query’s search results, the LRM can initiate follow-up searches and traverse deeper links until it collects all relevant information.

To facilitate scientific report writing, we introduce an Autonomous Think-Search-and-Draft strategy that deeply integrates report writing with the reasoning and search processes of LRMs. Rather than generating the entire report all at once after searching, our approach enables the model to draft and seek necessary knowledge in real-time. To achieve this, we equip LRMs with three specialized tools: (1) drafting content for specific chapters, (2) checking the current report, and (3) editing the report. These tools enable LRMs to autonomously enhance the report by maintaining comprehensiveness, coherence, and adaptability to newly discovered information during reasoning.

To further unlock the deep research potential of LRM backbones, we develop RL-based training strategies to optimize end-to-end task performance. We leverage the LRM equipped with the research tools to sample large-scale reasoning trajectories from complex tasks [46, 56, 47, 65, 25, 11]. Based on the accuracy of reasoning, tool usage, and final outputs, we construct preference pairs for online DPO training [40, 57, 5]. Through iterative, on-policy RL training, the model progressively improves its ability to perceive, reason, and interact with research tools effectively.

We conduct extensive experiments on (1) knowledge-intensive complex reasoning benchmarks, including GPQA [41], GAIA [32], WebWalkerQA [56], and Humanity’s Last Exam (HLE) [37] to assess complex problem-solving capabilities, and (2) open-ended reasoning tasks from Glaive [11] to evaluate report quality. As Figure 1 shows, WebThinker consistently outperforms all competing approaches. Specifically, WebThinker surpasses Search-o1 by 21.9% and 36.2% on the GAIA and HLE datasets, respectively, and even outperforms Grok3 and Gemini2.0 on report generation tasks.

DeepSeek-R1 [14] demonstrate explicit chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning [55], resembling human system-2 thinking in tasks such as math and programming [28]. Various strategies have been proposed to achieve o1-like reasoning capabilities [9, 4, 45, 59, 16]. Some approaches introduce intentional reasoning errors during training to help models partially internalize reasoning patterns [39, 64]. Others enhance reasoning ability through distilled training data [33]. More recently, reinforcement learning has been explored as a means to develop long CoT abilities in LLMs [14, 59, 16]. However, these methods are constrained by their reliance on static, parameterized architectures that lack access to external world knowledge. This limitation becomes particularly problematic in complex reasoning tasks requiring extensive real-world information.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances generative models by integrating retrieval mechanisms, enabling access to external knowledge beyond static parameters [24, 66]. Recent advances cover multiple dimensions, including retrieval necessity [44], query reformulation [31, 52, 69], document compression [60, 23, 68], denoising [30, 21], and instruction-following [6]. Moreover, complex workflows such as structured planning [51, 58, 17] and decision-making frameworks [29, 13] have shown notable gains in multi-hop reasoning, planning, and domain-specific tasks [53]. Recent work has also explored integrating o1-style reasoning with retrieval. For example, Search-o1 [26] incorporates an agentic RAG framework and a Reason-inDocuments module to merge retrieval with reasoning via prompt engineering. Other studies employ reinforcement learning to train reasoning with search capabilities from scratch [22, 43, 2, 67, 50, 8, 27, 38, 54], showing strong results in Wikipedia-based QA. Nonetheless, these methods fall short in adapting to complex real-world reasoning scenarios and comprehensive report-writing tasks.

### 3 Methodology

#### 3.1 Problem Formulation

We consider a complex reasoning task that requires both multi-step reasoning and the utilization of research tools. The objective is to generate a comprehensive answer solution for a given task query q, guided by an instruction I. A solution comprises a logical reasoning chain R and a final output y (which could be an answer or a signal indicating completion). WebThinker enables the reasoning model to autonomously invoke tools from an available set T during its reasoning process, which can be formalized as the mapping (I,q,T ) → (R,y). The generation process can be expressed as:

Tr t=1

Ty t=1

P(R,y | I,q,T ) =

P(Rt | R<t,I,q,{Oτ}τ<t)

P(yt | y<t,R,I,q)

Final Output Generation

where Tr is the number of tokens in the reasoning sequence R. The token at position t is Rt, and R<t represents all tokens generated before position t. {Oτ}τ<t denotes the outputs of all tool calls made before position t. Similarly, Ty is the length of the output sequence y, with yt being the token at position t and y<t indicating all generated output tokens before position t.

- Figure 3: Overview of the WebThinker framework. It operates in two modes: (1) Problem-Solving Mode equips reasoning models with a search tool backed by a Deep Web Explorer, enabling thorough web exploration to retrieve relevant information for solving complex real-world problems. (2) Report Generation Mode extends the model’s capabilities with writing, checking, and editing capabilities, allowing it to iteratively craft comprehensive research reports while thinking and searching.

#### 3.2 Overview of the WebThinker Framework

WebThinker is designed to enhance large reasoning models with deep research capabilities by enabling autonomous web exploration and report generation during the reasoning process. As illustrated in Figure 3, WebThinker operates in two primary modes:

- • Problem-Solving Mode: Empowers the LRM with a Deep Web Explorer module. When encountering knowledge gaps, the LRM can autonomously initiate web searches, navigate through web pages by clicking links or buttons, and extract relevant information before continuing its reasoning. This facilitates in-depth information gathering beyond standard shallow search.
- • Report Generation Mode: Implements an Autonomous Think-Search-and-Draft strategy. The LRM interleaves reasoning, information seeking (via the Deep Web Explorer), and report generation. It utilizes specialized tools for drafting, checking, and editing report sections, executed by an assistant LLM leveraging an explored document memory, to ensure the final report is comprehensive, coherent, and grounded in the gathered evidence.

#### 3.3 Solving Complex Reasoning Tasks with the Deep Web Explorer

In the Problem-Solving Mode, WebThinker tackles complex tasks requiring knowledge beyond the LRM’s internal parameters. The core component is the Deep Web Explorer tool, Texp ∈ T , which the LRM can invoke during reasoning (Figure 3).

Given a task-specific instruction Iq and query q, the LRM generates a reasoning chain R, potentially interspersed with calls to the Deep Web Explorer. The final output in this mode is typically a direct answer a. The generation process is formalized as:

Tr t=1

Ta t=1

P(Rt | R<t,Iq,q,{Oexp(j)}j<i(t)) ·

P(at | a<t,R,Iq,q), (2) where a = (a1,...,aT

P(R,a | Iq,q) =

) is the answer sequence. {Oexp(j)}j<i(t) denotes the set of outputs from all Deep Web Explorer calls completed before reasoning step t.

a

The Deep Web Explorer itself is driven by the LRM, operating under a specific instruction Ie. It utilizes two elementary tools: a search engine Ts to retrieve web pages based on a generated query qs, and a navigation tool Tn to interact with elements (e.g., click links) on the currently viewed page(s) D. The explorer, triggered by an information need qs, generates its own internal reasoning chain Re to decide whether to search further or navigate deeper based on the evolving web content Dt it encounters. Its goal is to produce a concise output Oexp that addresses the knowledge gap in the main

reasoning chain R. The exploration process within the tool is modeled as:

Te t=1

P(Re,t | Re,<t,qs,Dt,Ie) · P(Oexp | Re,qs,D,Ie), (3)

P(Re,Oexp | qs,D,Ie) =

where Te is the length of the explorer’s reasoning chain Re. Dt represents the web content available at step t, which dynamically changes based on search and navigation actions. This hierarchical structure allows the main reasoning process to delegate complex information gathering tasks to the Deep Web Explorer, which can recursively search and navigate the web.

#### 3.4 Generating Comprehensive Reports via Autonomous Think-Search-and-Draft

In the Report Generation Mode, the LRM autonomously produces comprehensive reports by interleaving reasoning, searching, and writing. Besides the Deep Web Explorer (Texp) for knowledge acquisition, the LRM utilizes a set of report writing tools Twrite = {Tdraft,Tcheck,Tedit}. These tools are implemented by an assistant LLM, separating the complex task orchestration performed by the main LRM from the detailed text manipulation required for report writing.

All web pages explored via Texp are accumulated in a document memory M. When the main LRM decides to invoke a writing tool (e.g., Tdraft), it generates an editing instruction e. The assistant model then receives e, the current report state r, and relevant documents Dtop-k retrieved from M. It produces the updated report content rnew according to:

Trnew t=1

P(rnew,t | rnew,<t,e,Dtop-k,r), (4) where Tr

P(rnew | e,Dtop-k,r) =

is the length of the newly generated/edited report content rnew.

new

The main LRM’s role is to orchestrate the overall process: performing reasoning steps, deciding when to explore for more information using Texp, and determining when and how to modify the report using Twrite. The main reasoning process concludes when the LRM generates the EOS token, denoted as yend. This overall process, conditioned on the initial instruction I and query q, is formalized as:

Tr t=1

P(Rt | R<t,I,q,{Oexp(j)}j<i(t)) · P(yend | R,M), (5)

P(R,yend | I,q) =

where {Oexp(j)}j<i(t) represents outputs from prior Deep Web Explorer calls. The document memory M serves as the knowledge base for the assistant LLM (Eq. 4) executing the writing operations.

#### 3.5 Improving LRMs with Research Tools via Reinforcement Learning

To enhance the LRM’s ability to effectively utilize research tools that range from high-level web exploration and report manipulation to elementary search and navigation actions, we employ onpolicy RL training. This focuses on constructing preference data reflecting desired tool usage patterns and applying an iterative online DPO [40, 57, 5] strategy.

Preference Data Construction. We generate diverse reasoning trajectories using WebThinker on complex datasets (e.g., SuperGPQA [46], WebWalkerQA [56], OpenThoughts [47], NaturalReasoning [65], NuminaMath [25], and Glaive [11]). For each query q, the LRM self-samples n distinct

trajectories {R(i)}ni=1, capturing varied solution strategies and tool usage patterns across the main reasoning chain and the Deep Web Explorer’s internal operations.

Our goal is to identify trajectories that demonstrate not only correctness but also efficient use of the research tools. To achieve this, we establish preference pairs (Rw,Rl), where Rw is the preferred trajectory and Rl is the dis-preferred trajectory. We apply the following criteria iteratively in order of priority to pairs of sampled trajectories (Ri,Rj) for the same task q:

- 1. Overall Correctness/Report Quality: If Ri yields a correct final answer (for reasoning tasks) or a higher quality final report (for report generation tasks), while Rj does not, then Ri is preferred (Rw = Ri,Rl = Rj). This rule takes precedence over all others.
- 2. Tool Efficiency: If both Ri and Rj reach the correct final answer, the trajectory with fewer total tool calls is preferred. If total_tool_calls(Ri) < total_tool_calls(Rj), then Rw = Ri,Rl = Rj.
- 3. Thinking Conciseness: If both Ri and Rj are correct and involve the same number of tool calls, the shorter trajectory is preferred when the length ratio exceeds the threshold γ > 1. If len(outputj)/len(outputi) > γ, then Rw = Ri,Rl = Rj.

By applying these rules across all valid sampled trajectory pairs for all tasks, we construct a collection D = {(I,q,Rw,Rl)k} of preference pairs.

Iterative Online DPO Training. We utilize the constructed preference dataset D to train the LRM using iterative online DPO. The standard DPO loss function aims to increase the likelihood of preferred trajectories Rw while decreasing the likelihood of dispreferred trajectories Rl, relative to a reference policy πref:

πθ(Rw | I,q) πref(Rw | I,q) − β log

πθ(Rl | I,q) πref(Rl | I,q)

, (6)

LDPO(πθ;πref) = −E(R

w,Rl)∼D log σ β log

where πθ is the policy being trained, β is a hyperparameter controlling the deviation from the reference policy, and σ is the sigmoid function.

We employ an iterative online scheme: (1) Train πθ on the current preference set D using Eq. 6. (2) Use the updated πθ to sample new trajectories for the tasks (exploration). (3) Apply the preference criteria (1-3) to the new trajectories to generate an updated preference set D′. (4) Set D ← D′ and πref ← πθ, then repeat from step (1). This iterative process enables the LRM to refine its tool usage strategy, continuously improving performance via on-policy interaction with the environment.

We compare against three types of methods: (1) Direct Reasoning: Models using only internal knowledge without search, including open-source models (Qwen2.5-32B/72B-Instruct [62], Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct [18], QwQ-32B [48], Llama3.3-70B-Instruct [7]) and closed-source models (DeepSeek-R1-671B [14], GPT-4o [19], o1-preview [34], o3-mini [36], Gemini-2.0-FlashThinking [10]). (2) Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning: Methods using external knowledge from search engines: (i) Standard RAG (retrieves for the original query); (ii) RAG w/ Query Planning (decomposes query, retrieves for sub-queries, then generates); and (iii) Iterative RAG (retrieves information iteratively). (3) Autonomous Search within Reasoning: Systems integrating search actions into reasoning, including the open-source Search-o1 framework [26], and non-proprietary systems like OpenAI Deep Research [35], Grok3 DeeperSearch [12], and Gemini2.0 Deep Research [10].

#### 4.3 Implementation Details

We use QwQ-32B [48] as WebThinker’s backbone in our main results. Assistant models use Qwen2.5-Instruct [62] with the same parameters as the backbone. Generation uses max 81920 tokens, temperature 0.7, top_p 0.8, top_k 20, and repetition penalty 1.05. Search uses Bing Web Search API (US-EN region, k=10) with content fetched via Crawl4AI [49]. Training involves 2 iterations of online DPO with a max sequence length of 32,768. For baselines not trained for o1-like reasoning, we use Chain-of-Thought (CoT) [55] prompting. Detailed instructions can be found in Appendix C.

WebThinker (Ours)

- Figure 5: Analysis of the performance of WebThinker with DeepSeek-R1-based models across 7B, 14B, and 32B sizes, compared with direct generation and standard RAG approaches.

- 1. Base LRM & RAG Workflow Limitations: Reasoning models (e.g., QwQ-32B) surpass standard LLMs (e.g., Qwen2.5-72B on GPQA avg.) but falter on knowledge-intensive tasks (GAIA, WebWalkerQA). RAG improves performance on these tasks but shows inconsistent gains on complex HLE tasks that require deep integration of reasoning and search.
- 2. Autonomous Search Advantage: Autonomous search (e.g., Search-o1) yields notable gains over direct reasoning and basic RAG, especially on GAIA, WebWalkerQA, and HLE (e.g., HLE avg: Search-o1 10.8 vs. RAG-QwQ-32B 7.2).
- 3. WebThinker Framework Superiority: Our training-free WebThinker-32B-Base, utilizing its Deep Web Explorer for deeper web exploration, consistently surpasses prior methods like Search-o1 across all benchmarks (e.g., +22.9% on WebWalkerQA and +20.4% on HLE, respectively).
- 4. RL Improvement: RL-trained WebThinker-32B-RL achieves SOTA among 32B models on all benchmarks, substantially improving over its Base version (e.g., +8.5% on GAIA and +21.5% on HLE, respectively). Notably, on HLE, it surpasses even stronger models like o3-mini (High).
- 4.5 Results on Scientific Report Generation

Main Results. Figure 4 (left) presents WebThinker’s performance on the Glaive scientific report generation task against RAG and non-proprietary baselines, evaluated on Completeness (Comp.), Thoroughness (Thorough.), Factuality (Fact.), and Coherence. WebThinker achieves the top overall score (8.0), surpassing RAG baselines and advanced systems like Gemini-Deep Research (7.9). It excels in Completeness (8.4) and Thoroughness (8.2), matching top Factuality (7.7) and Coherence (7.8) scores. These results highlight the Autonomous Think-Search-and-Draft strategy’s effectiveness in enabling LRMs to iteratively refine content through dynamic information gathering, yielding more comprehensive and coherent reports than predefined RAG workflows.

Analysis of Information Scopes. Qualitative t-SNE visualization of content embeddings for reports on three randomly sampled Glaive topics (Figure 4, right) shows distinct topic clusters, where each point is a report’s embedding. Notably, WebThinker’s reports often form broader sub-clusters within each topic group. This suggests WebThinker, with its Deep Web Explorer and iterative drafting, explores and synthesizes information from more diverse perspectives and depths than other methods. Its autonomous nature allows dynamic adaptation of information gathering and writing to evolving report needs, yielding richer and more unique information coverage.

#### 4.6 Adaptability of WebThinker Across Different LRM Backbones.

We assessed WebThinker’s adaptability with DeepSeek-R1 models of varying sizes (7B, 14B, 32B; Figure 5). To ensure stable tool usage, we conducted cold-start SFT (using 7.8k trajectories from QwQ-32B WebThinker) followed by RL training (Section 3.5). On all tasks and model sizes, R1based WebThinker consistently outperformed direct reasoning and standard RAG. For example, WebThinker-R1-7B achieved relative gains of 174.4% (GAIA) and 422.6% (WebWalkerQA) over direct generation, and 82.9% (GAIA) and 161.3% (WebWalkerQA) over standard RAG. Similar substantial improvements were observed across other settings, demonstrating WebThinker’s general applicability and effectiveness in enhancing diverse LRMs’ deep research capabilities.

#### 4.7 Ablation Studies

Ablation studies (Table 3) assessed key WebThinker components. (1) RL Training: Iterative online RL markedly improves problem-solving (Avg. 44.9 vs. 42.1 Base, 43.2 offline DPO), validating our training strategy. Its impact on report generation is minimal, as the base framework is already effective. (2) Deep Web Exploration: Removing the Deep Web Explorer severely degrades both problem-solving (Avg. 38.3) and report generation (Avg. 7.7), proving its criticality. Disabling linkclicking alone also impairs problem-solving (Avg. 42.6), highlighting the value of deeper exploration. (3) Report Generation Components: Removing autonomous drafting causes the largest quality drop in report generation (Avg. 6.6), stressing the importance of interleaved thinking, searching, and drafting. Disabling check-and-edit tools also reduces quality (Avg. 7.7), notably coherence (6.9 vs. 7.9), reinforcing the need for iterative refinement. These findings affirm WebThinker’s design.

### 5 Conclusion

In this work, we present WebThinker, which equips large reasoning models with deep research capabilities by enabling autonomous web exploration and comprehensive report generation through agentic reasoning. We develop: (1) a Deep Web Explorer for dynamic web page navigation, (2) an autonomous Think-Search-and-Draft strategy that integrates reasoning, searching, and writing, and (3) RL-based training strategies to enhance research tool utilization. Experiments on complex reasoning benchmarks and scientific report generation tasks demonstrate that WebThinker outperforms existing methods and proprietary systems. Despite its strengths, WebThinker has several limitations that require further improvement. First, it cannot process multimodal information such as images and videos, making the development of multimodal deep research systems an important direction. Second, it currently supports only a limited set of tools, underscoring the need for tool scalability and generalization. Finally, extending WebThinker to support GUI-based web exploration would enable it to handle more complex and real-world interactive tasks.

### A Inference Process

- A.1 Research-Related Tools WebThinker utilizes several tools during its inference process:

- • Search Tool: This tool is employed by both the main reasoning process and the Deep Web Explorer. In the main process, it invokes the Deep Web Explorer, while within the Explorer, it calls a standard search engine API. The model signals a search query by generating and

|<|begin_search_query|>|
|---|

|<|end_search_query|>|
|---|

. The processed search results are then returned within and

|<|begin_search_result|>|
|---|

|<|end_search_result|>|
|---|

.

- • Link & Button Clicking Tool: This tool is exclusively used by the Deep Web Explorer to interact with web pages, typically invoking a web crawler. We use Crawl4AI [49] for fetching web page content. The model triggers this tool by generating

|<|begin_click_link|>|
|---|

and

|<|end_click_link|>|
|---|

. The con-

tent retrieved from the clicked link (potentially summarized) is returned within and

|<|begin_click_result|>|
|---|

|<|end_click_result|>|
|---|

.

- • Report Writing Tools: These tools are specific to the Report Generation Mode and are invoked by the main reasoning process. They facilitate drafting and refining the research report.

- – Section Writing: Triggered by

|<|begin_write_section|>|
|---|

section_name\ncontents_to_write

|<|end_write_section|>|
|---|

. This command instructs an assistant LLM to write the specified section based on the provided content guidelines and gathered information. It does not return content directly into the main reasoning flow to maintain coherence.

- – Report Checking: Triggered by

|<|begin_check_article|>|
|---|

. This command requests the current outline of the report. The system extracts all section and subsection titles to form the outline, which is then inserted into the reasoning context followed by

|<|end_check_article|>|
|---|

. This avoids injecting the full report text, which could disrupt the reasoning flow.

- – Report Editing: Triggered by

|<|begin_edit_article|>|
|---|

edit_instruction

|<|end_edit_article|>|
|---|

. This command instructs an assistant LLM to modify the existing report based on the provided editing instructions. Similar to section writing, it doesn’t return content directly into the main flow.

- A.2 Inference Process of WebThinker

The overall inference process in WebThinker involves two main components: the main reasoning process and the Deep Web Explorer for in-depth information gathering. As outlined in Section 3.2, the main reasoning process operates in two distinct modes: Problem-Solving Mode and Report Generation Mode. Detailed instructions for each component and mode can be found in Section C.

#### A.2.1 Inference for Main Reasoning Process

Problem-Solving Mode: In this mode, the LRM receives a user’s question and aims to find a direct answer. It primarily utilizes the Search Tool. When the model generates the token, the generation process pauses. The system extracts the most recent query enclosed within

|<|end_search_query|>|
|---|

. Concurrently, an assistant LLM formulates a detailed search intent based on the query and the preceding reasoning chain. The system then uses a web crawler to fetch the content of the top-k (k=10 in our experiments) retrieved web documents. The original query, the generated search intent, and the fetched web content are passed to the Deep Web Explorer. The Explorer processes this information and returns a refined summary relevant to the query and intent, enclosed within

and

|<|begin_search_query|>|
|---|

|<|end_search_query|>|
|---|

. The main LRM then resumes its reasoning with this new information. This cycle continues until the model generates an End-of-Sequence (EOS) token or reaches the maximum token limit. The final answer is extracted based on a predefined answer pattern (e.g., \boxed{ANSWER} or ANSWER: {ANSWER}).

and

|<|begin_search_result|>|
|---|

|<|end_search_result|>|
|---|

Report Generation Mode: This mode handles tasks requiring the generation of a comprehensive research report. It receives the user’s question along with a research plan (potentially generated by an assistant LLM). The LRM utilizes the Search Tool (invoking the Deep Web Explorer as in Problem-Solving Mode) and the three Report Writing Tools (Section Writing, Report Checking, Report Editing). Similar to the problem-solving mode, generation pauses whenever the model outputs

a closing tool token (

) or the opening token for checking (

,

,

|<|end_search_query|>|
|---|

|<|end_write_section|>|
|---|

|<|end_edit_article|>|
|---|

).

|<|begin_check_article|>|
|---|

- • For search, the process mirrors the Problem-Solving Mode: invoke the Deep Web Explorer and insert results between

|<|begin_search_result|>|
|---|

and

|<|end_search_result|>|
|---|

.

- • For section writing and report editing, the corresponding assistant LLM performs the action in the background. Since no direct output is inserted, the main LRM continues its reasoning immediately after generating the end token.
- • For report checking, the system generates the report outline, appends the

token, inserts this into the context, and resumes generation.

|<|end_check_article|>|
|---|

The model continues this loop of reasoning, searching, and drafting/editing until it generates an EOS token or reaches the maximum token limit. The final, complete report is the accumulated result of the writing and editing actions performed by the assistant LLM throughout the process.

#### A.2.2 Inference for Deep Web Explorer

Deep Web Explorer: The Deep Web Explorer operates as a sub-process invoked by the main reasoning process when a search is needed. Its goal is to deeply investigate the initial search results provided by the main process. It has access to two tools: a direct Search Engine call and the Link & Button Clicking Tool. When the Explorer model generates

, generation pauses.

or

|<|end_search_query|>|
|---|

|<|end_click_link|>|
|---|

- • A search action directly calls the search engine API (e.g., Bing) and returns the top-10 results, typically including titles, URLs, and snippets (not the full page content). These results are inserted into the Explorer’s reasoning context.
- • A link click action uses the crawler (Crawl4AI) to fetch the full content of the specified URL. To manage potentially long web pages, an assistant LLM summarizes the fetched content based on a generated "click intent", ensuring the inserted information is concise and relevant. The summarized

result is placed within

and

.

|<|begin_click_result|>|
|---|

|<|end_click_result|>|
|---|

The Explorer continues its internal reasoning process—analyzing results, deciding whether to perform another search, or clicking on a promising link—until it gathers sufficient information relevant to the initial query and search intent provided by the main reasoning process. It concludes by generating its findings within a designated "Final Information" pattern, which is then passed back to the main reasoning process as the output within

. This process stops when the Explorer generates an EOS token or reaches its maximum token limit.

and

|<|begin_search_result|>|
|---|

|<|end_search_result|>|
|---|

### B Datasets

- B.1 Complex Reasoning Tasks For testing, we use the following four widely used datasets:

- • GPQA [41]: Written by experts (holding or pursuing PhDs in relevant fields) in biology, physics, and chemistry, these "Google-proof" questions test the model’s expertise and reasoning in these specific domains. It consists of multiple-choice questions (4 options each); we use the diamond set, totaling 198 questions.
- • GAIA [32]: A benchmark dataset designed to evaluate the capabilities of general artificial intelligence (AGI). Compared to GPQA, GAIA focuses more on generality, testing AI performance across diverse tasks such as question answering, reasoning, code generation, and multimodal processing. As our model is text-based and cannot handle other modalities, we use the text-only validation subset, comprising 103 questions.
- • WebWalkerQA [56]: A benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the web traversal capabilities of LLMs, simulating human ability to explore websites via clicking to find required information. It includes 680 challenging queries covering multilingual and multi-domain web content. We use the test set for evaluation, totaling 680 questions.

- • Humanity’s Last Exam (HLE) [37]: Aims to assess LLMs’ capabilities at the frontiers of human knowledge. It contains 2500 challenging cross-disciplinary questions covering fields like mathematics, humanities, and natural sciences. The benchmark includes multiple-choice and short-answer questions, all with clear and easily verifiable solutions. Current state-of-the-art models achieve less than 10% accuracy on HLE, highlighting its difficulty and effectiveness in measuring advanced academic capabilities. Due to its large test set, we randomly sample 500 text-only questions for testing.

For training, we use the following datasets. We sample approximately 3k data points from these datasets. First, we perform direct generation using QwQ-32B and retain only the questions that cannot be answered correctly through direct generation. Then, for each of these questions, we generate three responses using WebThinker-32B-Base to filter for high-quality preference training data, following the criteria outlined in Section 3.5.

- • SuperGPQA [46]: Designed to evaluate LLM knowledge and reasoning across 285 graduate-level subjects. It contains 26,529 multiple-choice questions covering 72 fields, grouped into 13 broader disciplines, with a strong emphasis on STEM subjects (77.2%).
- • WebWalkerQA (Silver) [56]: We use the Silver set of WebWalkerQA, containing 13.6k data points. The description is the same as above.
- • OpenThoughts [47]: Contains 114,000 carefully crafted reasoning examples designed to train AI models for complex logical and mathematical reasoning tasks. Given that we already use NuminaMath as training data, we prioritize sampling data related to STEM and puzzles.
- • NaturalReasoning [65]: Aims to enhance LLM reasoning capabilities through 2.8 million challenging reasoning problems across multiple domains, including STEM (e.g., physics and computer science), economics, and social sciences.
- • NuminaMath [25]: Features problems ranging in difficulty from high school exercises to International Mathematical Olympiad questions, sourced from various online platforms and PDFs. NuminaMath provides high-quality, structured data enabling AI models to learn and replicate expert-level mathematical reasoning.

#### B.2 Scientific Report Generation Tasks

For the scientific report generation task, we use glaiveai/reasoning-v1-20m (Glaive) [11] for both training and testing. This dataset is a large-scale synthetic collection containing over 22 million general reasoning questions and responses generated using DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B [14].

It aims to cover diverse non-code/math topics such as social and natural sciences, education, and creative writing. We sample 1.5k questions for each iteration’s preference data construction and 30 questions for testing.

#### C.3 Instructions for Evaluation

In this work, we use LLM-as-Judges to evaluate both complex problem-solving and scientific report generation tasks. The specific instructions are as follows:

#### C.3.1 Evaluation Instruction for Problem-Solving Tasks

We use Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct [62] to evaluate all complex problem-solving tasks. An output labeled as "Correct" is considered correct, while "Incorrect" is considered wrong. In cases where the predicted answer cannot be accurately extracted, we directly use the last five lines of the model’s output as the predicted answer. This approach helps reduce evaluation inaccuracies caused by formatting issues, case sensitivity, and similar factors, aligning with the official evaluation methods of benchmarks like WebWalkerQA [56] and HLE [37].

Evaluation Instruction for Problem-Solving Tasks

You are an evaluation assistant. Please determine if the predicted answer is equivalent to the labeled answer. Question:

{question} Labeled Answer: {labeled_answer} Predicted Answer:

{pred_answer} Are these answers equivalent? Please respond with "Correct" if they are equivalent, or "Incorrect" if they are not equivalent. Do not include any other text.

#### C.3.2 Evaluation Instruction for Report Quality

For scientific report generation tasks, we use DeepSeek-R1-671B [14] and GPT-4o [19] respectively with the following instruction for evaluation, obtain scores, and take their average. Here,

{system_a} to {system_e} are sequentially the reports generated by the systems being evaluated. We perform listwise evaluation to better compare the quality differences between reports generated by different systems. The input order is randomized rather than fixed to reduce bias caused by the model’s context window. We did not employ human evaluation because the reports generated by each system have distinct features, making it easy for humans to identify their originating system, which introduces significant bias. Model-based evaluation is therefore more impartial.

### D Case Study

The examples from Tables 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 demonstrate WebThinker’s effectiveness across different capabilities including complex problem solving, deep web exploration, and scientific report generation.

- D.1 Case Study for Complex Problem Solving WebThinker shows strong reasoning capabilities in complex problem-solving scenarios:

- • In the GAIA dataset example (Table 4), WebThinker correctly identifies that Nemo from "Finding Nemo" is a clownfish, and methodically searches for nonnative sightings in the USGS database, finding the only documented case at Fred Howard Park, Florida. It then determines the correct zip code (34689).
- • For the WebWalkerQA example (Table 5), WebThinker resolves ambiguity about the "evening after" the ACL 2023 awards ceremony by searching for relevant dates and determining that the social event occurred on the same day (July 11) from 7:00 PM to 10:30 PM, not the following day.
- • In the mathematical problem from Humanity’s Last Exam (Table 6), WebThinker demonstrates sophisticated reasoning by finding the formula for simplicial volume of surfaces and their products, correctly calculating the simplicial volume of Σ31 × Σ17 as 11520.

- D.2 Case Study for Deep Web Explorer The Deep Web Explorer demonstrates effective information retrieval and integration:

- • For the ASH Annual Meeting deadlines (Table 7), the explorer not only finds the late-breaking abstract submission dates but also discovers the ancillary meeting deadline by clicking on a PDF link, compiling comprehensive deadline information with specific dates and requirements.
- • In the CLTS and Aedes mosquito control example (Table 8), the explorer clicks on a repository link to find a case study integrating Community-Led Total Sanitation with mosquito control in Indonesia, Vietnam, and the Philippines, providing specific outcomes (40% reduction in breeding sites).

- D.3 Case Study for Scientific Report Generation WebThinker’s report generation capability is illustrated in Tables 9 and 10:

- • The model systematically follows a research plan for optimizing 3D printed lattice structures, conducting searches on FDM limitations, lattice optimization techniques, and material properties.
- • It methodically writes, checks, and edits sections, addressing duplicate content and ensuring coherent structure.
- • The final report (Table 10) presents a comprehensive analysis of lattice optimization for robotic nodes, covering technical aspects from printing limitations to material selection, with practical applications and case studies.

These examples validate WebThinker’s effectiveness across complex problem-solving, deep web exploration, and scientific report generation tasks.

- E Summary of Contributions In summary, the core contributions of this paper is as follows:

- 1. We introduce WebThinker, a deep research agent that autonomously search, deeply explore web pages, and draft research reports, all within its thinking process. Unlike traditional predefined workflow, WebThinker enables the LRM itself to perform actions on its own while thinking, achieving end-to-end task execution in a single generation.
- 2. We propose a Deep Web Explorer that empowers LRMs with web search and navigation capabilities to deeply gather, traverse, and extract high-quality information from the web.
- 3. We introduce an Autonomous Think-Search-and-Draft strategy that enables real-time report writing during the thinking and searching process.
- 4. We develop RL-based training strategies that iteratively synthesize tool-usage preference data and apply online DPO training to enhance the LRM’s tool utilization capabilities.
- 5. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of WebThinker on complex reasoning tasks and scientific report generation tasks with both QwQ-based [48] and DeepSeek-R1-based [14] LRM backbones.

- F Broader Impact

This work introduces WebThinker, a framework designed to significantly enhance the deep research capabilities of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). By empowering LRMs to autonomously explore the web, synthesize information from diverse sources, and generate comprehensive reports, WebThinker addresses critical limitations in tackling knowledge-intensive real-world tasks. The potential broader impact of our research is considerable, offering a new paradigm for how complex information is accessed, processed, and utilized across various domains. This could accelerate scientific discovery, improve the quality of investigative journalism, and support more informed decision-making in sectors like finance and policy-making by providing powerful tools for in-depth research. Moreover, WebThinker has the potential to democratize access to advanced research capabilities, fostering innovation and learning.

The societal consequences of deploying such advanced research agents demand careful and proactive consideration. The ability to autonomously gather, interpret, and synthesize vast quantities of online

information carries risks, including the potential for generating and disseminating sophisticated misinformation, or inadvertently amplifying biases present in the training data and web sources. Concerns regarding data privacy, the verifiability of AI-generated research, and the potential displacement of human expertise in research-intensive roles must also be addressed. Therefore, it is imperative that the advancement of technologies like WebThinker is coupled with the development of ethical guidelines, robust validation mechanisms, and a commitment to transparency to mitigate potential harms and ensure these tools serve the broader public good.

Example # from GAIA Dataset Question:

I’m researching species that became invasive after people who kept them as pets released them. There’s a certain species of fish that was popularized as a pet by being the main character of the movie Finding Nemo. According to the USGS, where was this fish found as a nonnative species, before the year 2020? I need the answer formatted as the five-digit zip codes of the places the species was found, separated by commas if there is more than one place.

Labeled Answer: 34689

Model Output by WebThinker

Okay, let’s tackle this question step by step. The user wants to know the five-digit zip codes of places in the US where the clownfish (the main character from Finding Nemo) has been found as a nonnative species according to the USGS, before 2020. First, I need to confirm which species is the main character in Finding Nemo. That’s Nemo the clownfish, specifically *Amphiprion ocellaris*. It’s important to look for the correct species. Next, the user mentioned the USGS database on nonindigenous aquatic species. I need to check this database for records before 2020. The task requires the answer formatted as five-digit zip codes. I need to find out if the USGS data provides this level of detail or if I’ll need to find the zip codes based on reported locations (like cities or parks). Let me start by searching the USGS for nonnative sightings of *Amphiprion ocellaris* before 2020. USGS Amphiprion ocellaris nonnative sightings pre 2020 The only documented nonnative sighting of *Amphiprion ocellaris* (clown anemonefish) in the United States prior to 2020, as reported by the USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species (NAS) database, occurred in **Pinellas County, Florida**, specifically at **Fred Howard Park** in the Gulf of Mexico region during **2018**. [...] The provided web pages do not explicitly mention the **five-digit zip code** associated with this location. [...] For precise zip code details, accessing the full NAS database record [...] may be necessary. Okay, the search result indicates only one sighting: Fred Howard Park in Pinellas County, Florida, in 2018. It explicitly states the zip code isn’t provided in the search results. So, I need to find the zip code for Fred Howard Park. The result mentions Pinellas County, but the park might be in a specific city within the county. Let me search for the park’s zip code.

Fred Howard Park St. Petersburg Florida zip code The zip code for Fred Howard Park in Tarpon Springs, Florida (part of Pinellas County) is **34689**. While the search query references St. Petersburg, the park is officially located in Tarpon Springs [...]. The address consistently listed [...] is **1700 Sunset Drive, Tarpon Springs, FL 34689**. [...] Ah, the park is in Tarpon Springs, FL, within Pinellas County, and the zip code is 34689. The first search result mentioned this was the *only* documented sighting before 2020. To be absolutely sure, I’ll run the first search query again to confirm no other locations were missed.

Amphiprion ocellaris USGS nonnative sightings before 2020 The USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species (NAS) database indicates that *Amphiprion ocellaris* (clown anemonefish) has only one documented nonnative sighting in the United States prior to 2020. This sighting occurred in **Fred Howard Park**, **Pinellas County**, **Florida**, in **2018**. [...] No other locations besides Fred Howard Park are listed [...] as having nonnative sightings of *A. ocellaris* before 2020. The five-digit zip code for Fred Howard Park, Tarpon Springs, Florida, is **34689**. [...] Confirmed again. The only documented nonnative sighting before 2020 was at Fred Howard Park, zip code 34689. Since the user asked for zip codes separated by commas if there’s more than one, and there’s only one, the answer is just this single zip code.

Example from WebWalkerQA Dataset Question: What was the specific schedule for the social event held on the evening after the ACL 2023 best paper awards ceremony? Labeled Answer: The social event was scheduled from 7:00 PM to 10:30 PM on July 11th. Model Output by WebThinker

Okay, so the user is asking about the specific schedule of a social event that took place on the evening *after* the ACL 2023 best paper awards ceremony. First, I need to figure out when the awards ceremony actually happened. Let me search for that specifically.

ACL 2023 best paper awards ceremony date The ACL 2023 best paper awards ceremony took place on **July 11, 2023**, according to multiple sources: [...] Web Page 4 [...] explicitly states that the awards were announced on July 11, 2023. [...] Web Page 5 [...] mentions the award presentation occurred on July 11, 2023 [...]. Web Page 6 [...] confirms the awards were announced on July 11, 2023. [...] Web Page 9 [...] also indicates the awards were announced

|<|begin_search_query|>|
|---|

|<|end_search_query|>|
|---|

|<|begin_search_result|>|
|---|

- on July 11, 2023. [...] the awards ceremony itself was held on the **11th**. [...] Okay, the awards ceremony was definitively on July 11, 2023. The question asks for the social event on the evening *after* the ceremony, which would be the evening of July 12. Let me search for the social events schedule to see what was planned.

|<|end_search_result|>|
|---|

|<|begin_search_query|>|
|---|

ACL 2023 social events schedule The ACL 2023 social events schedule includes the following relevant details: 1. **Social Event on July 11, 2023**: - **Time**: 7:00 PM – 10:30 PM (EDT) - **Location**: Steam Whistle Brewing [...] - **Description**: This event occurred on the evening of July 11, immediately following the Best Paper Awards ceremony (which took place earlier that day at 16:00–17:30). [...] 2. **No Explicit Social Events

|<|end_search_query|>|
|---|

|<|begin_search_result|>|
|---|

- on July 12, 2023**: - The evening of July 12, 2023, is not listed as having any official social events in the provided sources. [...] **Note**: The primary social event referenced in the sources is on July 11, not July 12. The Best Paper Awards ceremony was held on July 11, so the subsequent evening event likely refers to the Social Event on that same day. For July 12, only daytime sessions are documented. [...] Hmm, interesting. The awards were on July 11, and the search results show a social event on the evening of July 11, immediately following the awards ceremony (7:00 PM - 10:30 PM). However, the results explicitly state there were no official social events scheduled for the evening of July 12, which is technically the evening

|<|end_search_result|>|
|---|

*after* the July 11 ceremony. Given the user’s phrasing "evening after", but the lack of any scheduled event on July 12 evening, it’s highly probable they meant the social event that occurred on the *same evening* as the awards ceremony, which did happen *after* the ceremony concluded earlier that day. The only documented social event connected to the awards ceremony fits this description. Therefore, the specific schedule requested corresponds to the event on July 11.

|The social event on the evening after the ACL 2023 best paper awards ceremony (held on July 11, 2023) was scheduled from 7:00 PM to 10:30 PM EDT at Steam Whistle Brewing / Canada’s Premium Beer.|

Example from Humanity’s Last Exam Dataset Question: Let Σg denote the oriented closed surface of genus g. Compute the simplicial volume of Σ31 × Σ17. Labeled Answer: 11520 Model Output by WebThinker

Okay, so I need to compute the simplicial volume of Σ31 × Σ17, where Σg is an oriented closed surface of genus g. First, I should recall the simplicial volume of a single surface Σg. For g ≥ 2, the simplicial volume is ||Σg|| = 4(g − 1). Let me quickly verify this.

simplicial volume of a closed surface of genus g The simplicial volume of a closed surface of genus g ≥ 2 is indeed 4(g − 1). This result is derived from the relationship between simplicial volume and the Euler characteristic (χ) of the surface. Specifically, for a surface Σg of genus g, the Euler characteristic is χ(Σg) = 2 − 2g. The simplicial volume is given by ∥Σg∥ = 2|χ(Σg)|, leading to:

|<|begin_search_query|>|
|---|

|<|end_search_query|>|
|---|

|<|begin_search_result|>|
|---|

∥Σg∥ = 2|2 − 2g| = 4(g − 1).

[...] For the product of two closed surfaces of genus g, h ≥ 2, the simplicial volume ∥Σg × Σh∥ has known bounds related to the product of individual volumes, but the exact value requires specific theorems. [...] Sources confirm ∥Σg∥ = 4(g − 1). [...] Okay, the formula ||Σg|| = 4(g − 1) for g ≥ 2 is confirmed. Now, the core problem is the simplicial volume of the product Σ31 × Σ17. The first search mentioned bounds but not an exact formula. I need the specific rule for products of surfaces. Let me search for that.

|<|end_search_result|>|
|---|

simplicial volume of product of surfaces The simplicial volume of the product of two oriented closed surfaces of genus g and h

|<|begin_search_query|>|
|---|

|<|end_search_query|>|
|---|

|<|begin_search_result|>|
|---|

(each ≥ 2) is given by the formula:

3 2 · ∥Σg∥ · ∥Σh∥.

∥Σg × Σh∥ =

Substituting the known simplicial volumes of individual surfaces (∥Σg∥ = 4(g − 1) and ∥Σh∥ = 4(h − 1)), this becomes:

3 2 · 4(g − 1) · 4(h − 1) = 24(g − 1)(h − 1).

∥Σg × Σh∥ =

This result is derived from Michelle Bucher’s work, leveraging the proportionality principle for manifolds covered by H2 × H2. [...] Ah, perfect. The formula is ||Σg × Σh|| = 23 · ||Σg|| · ||Σh|| = 24(g − 1)(h − 1). Now I can substitute g = 31 and h = 17: ||Σ31 × Σ17|| = 24 · (31 − 1) · (17 − 1) ||Σ31 × Σ17|| = 24 · 30 · 16 Calculating this: 24 × 30 = 720 720 × 16 = 11520 So the simplicial volume is 11520. The simplicial volume of an oriented closed surface Σg of genus g ≥ 2 is 4(g − 1). For the product of two such surfaces Σg × Σh, the simplicial volume is given by 32 times the product of their individual simplicial volumes, which simplifies to 24(g − 1)(h − 1). Applying the formula for g = 31 and h = 17:

|<|end_search_result|>|
|---|

∥Σ31 × Σ17∥ = 24(31 − 1)(17 − 1) = 24 · 30 · 16 = 720 · 16 = 11520. Thus, the simplicial volume of Σ31 × Σ17 is

The clicked PDF (from UNAIR Repository) detailed a study integrating Community-Led Total Sanitation (CLTS) with Aedes mosquito control in rural Southeast Asia (Indonesia, Vietnam, Philippines). The study combined CLTS implementation (community mobilization, latrine construction) with vector control (larvicide distribution, education). Results showed a 40% lower prevalence of Aedes breeding sites in villages with the integrated approach compared to controls, demonstrating improved sanitation and reduced mosquito breeding through community engagement. [...] The UNAIR article provides the exact case study information we’re looking for, explicitly documenting CLTS integration with Aedes mosquito control in rural Southeast Asia. I should also search for additional case studies to provide a more comprehensive answer.

CLTS and dengue prevention in rural Indonesia No additional clear case studies of CLTS explicitly integrated with Aedes control were found in the search results. Most sources discuss either CLTS for sanitation improvements or Aedes control measures separately, but not their intentional integration. The previously found UNAIR Repository article remains the most relevant source documenting this specific integrated approach in Southeast Asia. [...] The additional search did not yield further explicit case studies beyond the UNAIR Repository article. ## Final Information Based on the analysis of web pages and further exploration, one key case study of CLTS integration with Aedes mosquito control in rural Southeast Asia was identified:

**Case Study from UNAIR Repository:** - **Location:** Rural villages in Indonesia, Vietnam, and the Philippines - **Intervention:** CLTS was combined with Aedes control measures including: - Community mobilization and latrine construction - Larvicide distribution for water container treatment - Education on identifying and eliminating breeding sites - Proper waste disposal and water storage practices - **Outcomes:** - 40% reduction in Aedes breeding sites in CLTS-integrated villages - Significant improvements in sanitation facilities - Enhanced community engagement and sustained behavior change While Web Page 6 mentioned government-community partnerships in vector control, and Web Page 10 highlighted breeding site management (though in Cameroon), neither explicitly discussed CLTS integration with Aedes control. The findings suggest that CLTS can be effectively combined with mosquito control by addressing the environmental conditions that enable mosquito breeding, particularly through improved waste management and water storage practices that reduce standing water sources.

Final Report Summary Optimizing Lattice Structures in 3D Printed Robotic Nodes for Swarm Robotics: Balancing Strengthto-Weight Ratio and Minimizing Support Material Introduction

Swarm robotics draws inspiration from social insects. The optimization of lattice structures in 3D printed robotic nodes is crucial for achieving high strength-to-weight ratios and minimizing support material, particularly in swarm robotics applications. Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) printing presents unique challenges [...]

###### FDM 3D Printing Limitations Impacting Lattice Design

Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) 3D printing is widely adopted but has inherent limitations affecting lattice design, including print orientation effects, overhang limitations, material property restrictions, and layer adhesion challenges [...]

###### Lattice Structure Optimization Techniques

Optimizing lattice structures involves balancing strength, weight, and support material reduction. Key approaches include multi-objective frameworks (e.g., combining Design of Experiments (DOE) and Genetic Algorithms (GA)), selecting prominent lattice patterns (e.g., Hexagon, Diamond/Octet, BCC/SC, Fluorite), using appropriate software tools, optimizing printing parameters, minimizing support material, and integrating connectors [...]

###### Key Factors Influencing Strength-to-Weight Ratio

Achieving a high strength-to-weight ratio is essential. This involves careful material selection, lattice architecture design, applying optimization techniques, performing testing and validation, and balancing competing parameters [...]

###### Reducing Support Material Through Design and Process Adjustments

Minimizing support material is essential for cost, efficiency, and quality. Strategies include strategic design modifications, optimizing printing orientation, using advanced support types, manual support placement, stress-guided topology optimization, and integrating connectors [...]

###### Integrating Connectors for Inter-Robot Communication and Power Transfer

In swarm robotics, communication and power transfer between nodes are essential. This requires integrating suitable mechanical and electrical connectors (e.g., Box Joint, Dovetail, Snap Fits), considering material selection, integration techniques, and specific design considerations [...]

Design Considerations Specific to Swarm Robotics Swarm robotics requires coordination through decentralized interactions. Design must account for communication systems, energy efficiency, mobility, structural integrity, and connector integration [...]

###### Material Selection for Enhanced Performance

Selecting appropriate materials (e.g., PLA, TPU, TPEE) is crucial. Considerations include mechanical properties, suitability for lattice structures, potential for closed-cell topologies or hybrid strategies, and specific material parameters and printing techniques [...]

Real-World Applications and Case Studies Practical applications demonstrate the effectiveness of these principles, including custom protective covers, modular structures using spatial lattice printing, rapid tooling replacement, and lattice-based nodes for swarm systems [...] Conclusion

Optimizing lattice structures for 3D printed swarm robots requires a holistic approach addressing FDM limitations, materials, and design. Selecting appropriate materials and lattice patterns enables high strength-toweight ratios while minimizing support. Connector integration enhances functionality. Careful consideration of parameters, orientation, and materials leads to robust, lightweight nodes for coordinated tasks, as shown in case studies [...] Future work should focus on further optimization and exploring new materials and technologies.

### NeurIPS Paper Checklist

#### 1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper’s contributions and scope?

Answer: [Yes] Justification: The abstract and introduction accurately describe the paper’s contributions and scope. Guidelines:

- • The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper.
- • The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
- • The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
- • It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper.

##### 2. Limitations Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors? Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The limitations and directions for future improvements are discussed in the conclusion section.

Guidelines:

- • The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
- • The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
- • The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be.
- • The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
- • The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon.
- • The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size.
- • If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness.
- • While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.

#### 3. Theory assumptions and proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof?

Answer: [NA] Justification: This paper does not involve theoretical results or proofs. Guidelines:

- • The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
- • All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and crossreferenced.
- • All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
- • The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide intuition.
- • Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
- • Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.

#### 4. Experimental result reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?

Answer: [Yes] Justification: Detailed information for all experimental results is provided in the main text and appendix. Guidelines:

- • The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
- • If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not.
- • If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
- • Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.
- • While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example

- (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm.
- (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.
- (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
- (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

#### 5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material?

Answer: [Yes] Justification: We provide complete code and model checkpoints to allow readers to reproduce our experimental results. Guidelines:

- • The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
- • Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/ public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
- • While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark).
- • The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https: //nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
- • The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
- • The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
- • At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if applicable).
- • Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.

#### 6. Experimental setting/details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results?

Answer: [Yes] Justification: The training and testing details are described in detail in the dataset description section of the main text and in the appendix. Guidelines:

- • The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
- • The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
- • The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.

#### 7. Experiment statistical significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments?

Answer: [No] Justification: Due to the high computational cost of our experiments, we did not report error bars. Guidelines:

- • The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
- • The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper.

- • The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions).
- • The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
- • The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
- • It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean.
- • It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified.
- • For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates).
- • If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

#### 8. Experiments compute resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments?

Answer: [Yes] Justification: The computational resources for the experiments are described in detail in the implementation details section. Guidelines:

- • The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
- • The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
- • The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
- • The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn’t make it into the paper).

#### 9. Code of ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?

Answer: [Yes] Justification: We have followed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. Guidelines:

- • The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
- • If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation from the Code of Ethics.
- • The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

#### 10. Broader impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed?

Answer: [Yes] Justification: Potential positive and negative societal impacts are discussed in section F. Guidelines:

- • The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.

- • If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
- • Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
- • The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.
- • The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
- • If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

#### 11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [NA] Justification: This work does not pose such risks. Guidelines:

- • The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
- • Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters.
- • Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
- • We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.

#### 12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected?

Answer: [Yes] Justification: All code, models, and datasets used are properly cited in the paper. Guidelines:

- • The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
- • The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
- • The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL.
- • The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
- • For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of that source should be provided.

- • If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset.
- • For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
- • If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the asset’s creators.

#### 13. New assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided alongside the assets?

Answer: [Yes] Justification: We provide an anonymous GitHub repository: https://github.com/ RUC-NLPIR/WebThinker Guidelines:

- • The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
- • Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations, etc.
- • The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is used.
- • At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.

#### 14. Crowdsourcing and research with human subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)?

Answer: [NA] Justification: This paper does not involve crowdsourcing or research with human subjects. Guidelines:

- • The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
- • Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main paper.
- • According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector.
