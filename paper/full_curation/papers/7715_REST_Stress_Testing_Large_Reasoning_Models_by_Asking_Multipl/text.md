Recent Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable progress on task-specific benchmarks, yet their evaluation methods remain constrained by isolated problem-solving paradigms. Existing benchmarks predominantly assess single-question reasoning through sequential testing, resulting critical limitations: (1) vulnerability to data contamination and less challenging (e.g., DeepSeek-R1 achieves 97.0% on MATH500), forcing costly and perpetual creation of new questions with large human efforts, (2) failure to evaluate models under multicontext pressure, a key requirement for real-world deployment. To bridge this gap, we present REST (Reasoning Evaluation through Simultaneous Testing), a stress-testing framework that exposes LRMs to multiple problems simultaneously. Beyond basic reasoning, REST evaluates several under-tested capabilities: contextual priority allocation, cross-problem interference resistance, and dynamic cognitive load management. Our evaluation across 34 advanced reasoning models on 7 reasoning benchmarks reveals several striking findings: Even state-of-the-art (SOTA) models like DeepSeek-R1 exhibit substantial performance degradation under stress testing, challenging the prevailing assumption that “LLMs are multi-problem solvers”. Crucially, REST demonstrates stronger discriminative power than existing benchmarks, revealing pronounced performance differences among models that exhibit similar, near-ceiling performance under single-question evaluations. Some key insights emerge from our analysis: (1) the “overthinking trap” is a critical factor contributing to the performance degradation; (2) the models trained with “long2short” technique preserve more accuracy of their single-problem performance under REST, outperforming standard-trained counterparts. These results establish REST as a cost-efficient, future-proof evaluation paradigm that better reflects real-world reasoning demands while reducing reliance on continuous human annotation.

### 1 Introduction

Recent years have witnessed significant advancements in the reasoning capabilities of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), which have demonstrated impressive performance across a variety of reasoning tasks, including mathematical problem solving [57, 35, 42, 36], code generation [21, 39], and complex concept understanding [38]. Researchers have proposed various benchmarks [7, 17, 38, 22, 25] to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of LRMs. However, the rapid advancement of LRMs has exposed critical limitations in current evaluation paradigms. Most benchmarks rely on single-question testing, where

models process and answer questions in isolation. While this approach is effective for early model development, it now faces two fundamental challenges.

First, many benchmarks, such as GSM8K [7] and MATH [17], are becoming less effective at distinguishing model performance, as current LRMs have achieved nearly saturated performance on them (e.g., DeepSeek-R1 achieves 97.0% on MATH500), the community is forced into a costly cycle of benchmark obsolescence - continuously developing new, more difficult datasets (e.g., AIME24 [59]) while discarding still-valuable existing ones. This raises our first key question: Can we enhance the utility of current benchmarks by making them more challenging without complete replacement?

Second, single-question evaluation fails to assess how models perform in real-world, multi-context scenarios where reasoning must occur across multiple, potentially interfering questions. For instance, in educational tutoring systems, an AI might need to simultaneously address a student’s follow-up questions while correcting previous misconceptions; also, in technical support, it may process multiple user-reported issues within a single context window. Though a few prior studies [6, 54, 44] have investigated multi-question prompting, they only focus on simple tasks such as text classification [40] or commonsense QA [46], which are insufficient to assess the reasoning capabilities of current LRMs. This leads to our second critical question: How well can current LRMs handle multiple questions simultaneously, and what factors affect their performance in such settings?

To answer the aforementioned research questions, we propose REST (Reasoning Evaluation through Simultaneous Testing), a simple yet powerful method that repurposes existing benchmarks into more challenging variants. Specifically, REST transforms existing benchmarks by concatenating multiple questions into a single instruction to evaluate these questions at once. Based on 7 representative reasoning benchmarks (e.g., GSM8K, MATH500, and AMC23), we reconstruct them into a multiquestion format (see Fig. 1 for illustration). Through a comprehensive evaluation under our REST of more than 30 state-of-the-art (SOTA) LRMS, we have obtained some valuable findings.

- • Even SOTA LRMs like DeepSeek-R1 [13] exhibit significant performance degradation under REST, such as 29.1% accuracy drop on AIME24, revealing a critical limitation in their reasoning robustness, challenging that “LLMs are inherently multi-problem solvers” [6, 54, 44].
- • Despite excelling in the single-question evaluation, several LRMs struggle to maintain their advantage under REST compared to their non-reasoning counterparts.
- • REST provides enhanced discriminative power. While many LRMs exhibit similar performance on single-question evaluations, they display notable differences in accuracy under REST.
- • Effectively revitalizes existing benchmarks, making them challenging again for top-tier models.

Through further analysis, we identify a key factor behind this performance drop: the overthinking phenomenon [45, 5, 53], where LRMs tend to generate unnecessarily redundant reasoning even for relatively simple problems. Besides, LRMs trained with “Long2Short” training [45, 1, 3], which encourages concise reasoning, perform better in REST, suggesting a promising direction for developing multi-question-capable LRMs. These findings have immediate implications for both evaluation practices and model development. REST offers a cost-effective, scalable alternative to constant benchmark replacement, while providing insights for building more robust reasoning systems capable of handling real-world, multi-context scenarios.

### 2 Related Work

#### 2.1 Compositional Instruction Training and Evaluation

Some recent works use multi-instruction or problem combinations for training data augmentation [26, 36, 24]. MathFusion [36] fuses semantically similar problem pairs to construct a more difficult one for enhanced mathematical problem solving. Mosaic-IT [24] concatenates randomly sampled instruction data with meta-instructions to reduce training cost and improve performance. To evaluate the ability of LLMs to follow compositional instructions simultaneously, several benchmarks have been proposed. Batch prompting [6], multi-problem prompting [54], and multi-task inference benchmark [44] investigate concatenating multiple independent tasks, primarily for inference efficiency on simple tasks like text classification. Compound-QA [19] focuses on increasing complexity within a single instruction, requiring models to follow multiple constraints, compositional directives, or sequential steps. These methods, however, do not focus on the evaluation of complex reasoning tasks.

#### 2.2 Overthinking and Controlled Reasoning Length in LRMs

Excessive verbosity in the reasoning processes of LRMs can hinder their inference efficiency. The phenomenon of “overthinking”, where models generate excessively long and complex reasoning steps without proportional gains in accuracy, has been identified [45, 5]. In response, several “long2short” or controlled reasoning length methods emerge. A prominent approach involves fine-tuning LRMs using reinforcement learning (RL) with penalties for excessive token generation [1, 3, 29], which effectively reduces the reasoning length while preserving or improving accuracy. Other strategies to promote conciseness include constrained prompting [33] and dynamic token budget allocation [14]. Importantly, the validation of these length-control techniques occur in single-problem evaluation settings. Our REST provides a new dimension for assessing LRMs under multi-problem scenarios.

#### 2.3 Reasoning Benchmarks

The rigorous assessment of the reasoning ability of LLMs relies heavily on specialized benchmarks. In mathematical reasoning, GSM8K [8] and MATH [16] are most commonly used. As model capabilities surge, harder benchmarks like OlympiadBench [15], AIME [2, 27], and Omni-Math [12] have emerged, further pushing the boundaries of mathematical evaluation. Beyond mathematics, reasoning in other domains like code generation [22, 37, 23], cryptographic decryption [25], and scientific problem-solving [38], is also critical. Despite the increasing difficulty and diversity of these benchmarks, the rapid improvement of models means that their differentiating power can diminish when evaluated solely through standard single-instance problem solving. Our REST builds on these existing benchmarks and repurposes them into more challenge variants.

### 3 REST: Reasoning Evaluation through Simultaneous Testing

Despite the significant progress in large reasoning models (LRMs), many existing benchmarks, such as MATH500 [17], have reached near-saturation performance levels, limiting their utility in distinguishing between the capabilities of increasingly powerful models. Our introduced REST aims to address this limitation, which is a new evaluation protocol designed to systematically increase the cognitive load on LRMs by aggregating multiple questions into a single prompt. This design enables a finer-grained assessment of a model’s ability to handle multi-step, continuous reasoning under stress. Below are the details of the benchmark reconstruction and evaluation under REST.

#### 3.1 REST Benchmark Reconstruction

Let the original benchmark be denoted as Q = {q1, q2, . . . qN}, where qi represents an individual question and N is the total number of questions. In REST, we transform this benchmark into a new prompt set Ps by concatenating s consecutive questions into each prompt. We refer to the parameter s ∈ Z+ as the stress level, since a larger s imposes a greater reasoning burden on the model. Formally, for each i ∈ {1,2, . . . , N}, we define the stress-level-s prompt pis as:

pis = Compose(qi, qi+1, . . . , q[(i+s−1) mod N]), i ∈ {1,2, . . . , N}.

To ensure continuity and full coverage, we apply cyclic indexing when the end of the benchmark is reached. The function Compose() formats multiple questions into a single prompt:

Compose(q1, . . . , qs) = “Q1 : {q1}, . . . , Qs : {qs}. Answer the above questions one by one.”

This transformation yields a new prompt set Ps = {p1s, p2s,..., psN}, where each prompt contains s questions. Importantly, ∥Ps∥ = N, matching the size of the original benchmark. However, unlike

the original benchmark, every prompt pis in Ps comprises s consecutive questions, spanning from qi to q[(i+s−1) mod N] rather than just a single question qi. Moreover, each original question qi appears exactly s times across all the prompts and exactly once in each of the s possible positions within the concatenated prompts. This design mitigates positional biases and ensures comprehensive coverage across stress levels.

#### 3.2 REST Evaluation

Under REST, given a LRM model f, we evaluate it on each prompt pis to obtain an output response ois = f(pis). From this response, we extract the individual predicted answers {aˆis, aˆis+1, . . . , aˆs[(i+s−1) mod N]} using a function Extract():

{aˆis, aˆis+1, . . . , aˆs[(i+s−1) mod N]} = Extract(ois).

To facilitate accurate extraction, we instruct LRMs to format their answers in task-specific ways. For Mathematical and GPQA problems, we instruct the model to put each answer within “\boxed{}”, while for code generation tasks, answers must be wrapped in Python code blocks “```python ```”. Notably, although a more structured format method like JSON output could offer convenience for output parsing, we deliberately avoid imposing such strict formatting constraints, as prior studies [47, 43] indicate that such requirements will degrade performance. We employ both rule-based and LLMbased extraction methods: (a) The rule-based method uses regular expressions to extract answers from predefined markers (e.g., “\boxed{}”); (b) The LLM-based method prompts a model to retrieve the predicted answer from the response for each question. Further implementation details can be found

in Appendix C. Finally, we define the model’s accuracy at stress level s by comparing the predicted answer aˆ and the ground truth answer a:

1 N

Acc(Ps) =

Acc(pis) =

where δ is the Kronecker delta function such that δ(i, j) = 1 if and only if i = j and 0 otherwise.

### 4 Experiment

#### 4.1 Evaluation Setup

We evaluate a total of 34 LRMs, spanning a parameter size range from 1.5B to 671B. The temperature and top_p parameters are configured according to the corresponding official guidelines for each model. We set a maximum output token length of 32K for reasoning models and 8K for non-reasoning models. In addition, we conduct experiments with an extended 128K token limit, but observe negligible performance differences, as shown in Tab. 5 of Appendix D. Our evaluation is based on OpenCompass* toolkit. To ensure consistency, we adopt the official prompt for each task, with a minor format adjustment for multi-question responses: “Answer the above questions one by one. Remember to put each answer within \boxed{} (or ```python ``` for code generation).”

We select 7 representative benchmarks for evaluation, and in REST, we set different stress levels s for each benchmark. Specifically, for relatively simple benchmarks like GSM8K, the stress levels are s ∈ {1,3,6,9,12}; for medium-difficulty benchmarks, including MATH500 and AMC23, they are set as s ∈ {1,3,5,7,9}; and for more challenging benchmarks, such as AIME24, AIME25, GPQA, and LiveCodeBench (v5), the stress levels are s ∈ {1,2,3,4,5}. To ensure clarity and consistency in evaluation, we report the performance of REST as the average accuracy across stress levels greater than 1. Detailed accuracy statistics for each stress level are provided in Appendix A. For relatively small benchmarks like AIME24, AIME25, and AMC23, we conduct 8 sampling runs and report the average results to reduce variance.

#### 4.2 Evaluation Result

Tab. 1 and Tab. 2 present the performance of various LRMs on the original reasoning benchmarks (Single) and their transformed counterparts by REST (Stress). Our key findings from the experimental results can be summarized as follows:

LRMs can handle multiple simple questions at once, but struggle with challenging ones. LRMs can address several relatively simple problems within a single reasoning process. As shown in Tab. 1, on GSM8K, the accuracy drops under REST for DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B (R1-7B) and DeepSeek-R1Distill-Qwen-32B (R1-32B) are just 0.43% and 0.04%, respectively. However, this robustness diminishes significantly when the models face more challenging problems. In Tab. 1 and Tab. 2, even SOTA LRMs (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) encounter substantial difficulties when tasked with multiple Olympiad-level competition problems within a single reasoning process. For instance, under REST, the accuracy of DeepSeek-R1 on AIME24 and AIME25 decreases by 29.17% and 31.58%, respectively, compared to the single-question setting. This performance gap is even more pronounced for smaller models, such as R17B, whose accuracy on AIME24 drops sharply from 54.17% to 16.53% under REST. Moreover, despite strong performance in the single-question setting, several LRMs fail to maintain their advantage under REST compared to their non-reasoning counterparts. For example, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B achieves an accuracy of 83.40% on MATH500 in the single-question evaluation, surpassing the 73.00%

of the Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B-Instruct model. However, under REST, its accuracy drops sharply to 42.47%, falling significantly behind Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B-Instruct, which achieves 53.94%.

REST enhances the discriminative power of existing benchmarks. By concatenating multiple problems into a single prompt, REST significantly amplifies performance differences among models that exhibit comparable, near-ceiling accuracy in traditional single-question evaluations. For example, on MATH500, R1-7B and R1-32B achieve single-question accuracies of 93.0% and 94.6%, respectively, with R1-7B trailing by just 1.6%. However, when evaluated under REST, the accuracy of R1-7B plummets to 66.75%, while R1-32B maintains a substantially higher 88.97%, revealing a pronounced 22.22% performance gap. This contrast is similarly evident among models of the same size. For instance,

- Figure 3: Limitation of post training on REST. Post training exacerbates performance degradation under higher stress levels compared to the original DeepSeek distilled models.

AReaL-boba-RL-7B and OpenThinker2-7B achieve similar, near-ceiling single-question accuracies of 95.0% and 93.8% on MATH500, respectively. Yet, under REST, the accuracy of AReaL-boba-RL-7B drops sharply to 60.77%, while OpenThinker2-7B preserves a significantly higher 83.30% accuracy. Similar trends are observed on AMC23, validating that REST can enhance the discriminative power of existing medium-difficulty benchmarks through problem concatenation.

Limitations of post training. The recent success of DeepSeek-R1 [13] has inspired numerous followup studies [30, 31, 55, 10, 20, 62], some of which have adopted post RL training with verifiable rewards (RLVR) [30, 31] or supervised fune-tuning (SFT) [55] based on DeepSeek-distilled models. Although such post training often yields improved single-question accuracy, our findings suggest that they can not maintain their performance advantage on more challenging, multi-question scenarios as in REST. For instance, models like AReaL-boba-RL-7B and Light-R1-7B-DS, both post-trained on DeepSeek-R1Distill-Qwen-7B, achieve single-question accuracies of 95.00% and 93.20% on MATH500, slightly higher than the 93.00% accuracy of R1-7B. However, under REST, their accuracies drop significantly to 60.77% and 61.73%, respectively, both falling behind the 66.75% achieved by R1-7B. This discrepancy becomes even more pronounced at higher stress levels. As detailed in Fig. 3b and Tab. 7 (in Appendix), at stress level s = 9, the accuracies of AReaL-boba-RL-7B and Light-R1-7B-DS decline sharply to 38.07% and 39.11%, respectively, more than 10.00% below the 49.42% achieved by R1-7B. This performance degradation is not limited to smaller models but also extends to larger ones, such as Light-R1-32BDS and R1-32B, and is consistently observed across other benchmarks like AMC23. These findings reinforce recent calls [11, 61, 41, 18] for a more cautious assessment of the benefits of post RL training in enhancing reasoning capabilities.

Potential of Long2Short Training. Despite their impressive performance on reasoning tasks, LRMs often struggle with excessively verbose reasoning processes [45, 5, 53]. To address this issue, recent studies [1, 3, 50] propose the Long2Short technique, which introduces a length reward in the training objective to promote more concise and efficient reasoning. Our experiments demonstrate that

- 5 Further Analysis

#### 5.1 Error Analysis

Maximum output length overflow is not the only cause of performance degradation. To uncover the underlying reasons for LRMs’ failures in REST, we analyze the primary factors contributing to performance degradation under stress conditions. A straightforward hypothesis is that performance drops primarily due to models exceeding their maximum output length when handling multiple problems. However, our findings indicate that this is not the sole cause—models frequently fail even when their responses remain well within the maximum output token limit.

To investigate the cause of errors, we categorize the observed mistakes into six distinct types, as summarized in Tab. 3. A detailed distribution of these error types for four representative LRMs on the AIME24 benchmark is illustrated in Fig. 5. The analysis reveals that Question Omission (QO) and Reasoning Error (RE) are the dominant

Table 3: Six common cause of the performance degradation in REST.

Error Cause Definition Output Truncation (OT) The output is trucated due to reaching the maximum output length (32K tokens for LRMs). Endless Repetition (ER) The model repeatedly generates the same phrase or sentence in its output. Format Violation (FV) The model fails to comply with the required output format (e.g., not putting the answer whtin “\boxed{}”). Question Omission (QO) The model fails to respond to all the given questions in the thinking process. (e.g., only answers the first question) Summary Error (SE) The model fails to summarize all the answers generated in the thinking process. Reasoning Error (RE) Error occurs in the reasoning process, such as calculation mistakes or concept misunderstandings.

Figure 5: The error type distribution for various LRMs on AIME24 under REST.

error types for DeepSeek-R1 (in subfigure 5d), collectively accounting for a substantial 42.00% of the performance degradation under stress test. The high frequency of Question Omission (QO) suggests that DeepSeek-R1 suffers from a pronounced question position bias, often focusing disproportionately on the first question in multi-problem prompts, despite explicit instructions to address each question sequentially. In contrast, error causes like Summary Error (SE), Output Truncation (OT), and Endless Repetition (ER) are rare in such high-capacity models.

However, for smaller models like Light-R1-7B (in subfigure 5b), the error profile shifts significantly, with Endless Repetition (ER) and Output Truncation (OT) becoming more prominent, collectively accounting for 48.90%. This shift underscores smaller models’ unique challenges, whose limited capacity significantly exacerbates performance degradation under the stress imposed by REST. Finally, it is important to note that no Format Violation (FV) errors were found for any of the four models, which is why they are not included in Fig. 5. This observation supports the robustness of our prompt design and answer extraction strategy, confirming that the observed performance degradation arises primarily from the intrinsic limitations of the LRMs themselves, rather than artifacts introduced by the evaluation process.

LRMs that perform better on REST exhibit concise reasoning for earlier questions. In this paragraph, we investigate why certain models exhibit substantial performance differences under REST, despite achieving similar results on traditional single-question benchmarks. To analyze this, on AIME24, we manually split the entire response into chunks corresponding to each question and

calculate the reasoning token count for each chunk. The results are presented in Fig. 6. It is evident that high-performing models under REST (e.g., Nemotron-nano-7B and DeepSeek-R1) tend to use fewer reasoning tokens for the first question when the stress level exceeds 1. In contrast, models with lower REST performance, such as R1-7B, often overthink the first question, consuming a substantial portion of their reasoning tokens and leaving insufficient space for subsequent questions. This observation reveals that LRMs with superior performance in REST tend to employ more concise reasoning for earlier questions under stress, leaving sufficient space to address subsequent questions. We refer to this ability as “adaptive reasoning effort allocation,” which we believe is a critical factor for achieving robust performance under REST.

#### 5.2 The Impact of Question Position and Question Order

Question position affects performance under stress test. Recent studies [60, 28] have identified positional biases of LLMs over long inputs. In this paragraph, we investigate whether the position of questions within the input can influence response accuracy. Fig. 7 presents a heatmap illustrating the accuracy for questions placed at different positions. The results indicate that questions appearing earlier consistently achieve higher accuracy, even under the highest stress levels, while the accuracy for later questions tends to decline as the stress level increases. This observation contrasts with earlier findings [54], which suggest that question position has a negligible effect on performance because previous analyses primarily focused on simpler text classification tasks. In contrast, complex reasoning tasks exhibit a stronger positional dependence. We attribute this position-dependent performance degradation to three primary factors. First, our error analysis reveals that Question Omission (QO) is a prevalent failure mode, even for SOTA LRMs like DeepSeek-R1, leading to high accuracy for the first question but significantly lower accuracy for the later ones. Second, the extensive reasoning required for earlier questions can introduce substantial noise, potentially disrupting the logical processing needed for subsequent responses. Finally, as shown in Fig. 6, answering earlier questions may consume a considerable portion of the output tokens, reducing the model’s available reasoning tokens for later questions.

- Figure 7: The effect of question position under stress tests. The performance at each position is calculated by averaging the accuracy of questions appearing at the same position across the full benchmark. LRMs generally achieve higher accuracy for earlier questions, while their performance declines for subsequent ones.

Question order affects performance under stress test. Building on the observation that question position impacts performance, we further investigate the effect of question order within each prompt on overall benchmark accuracy. Specifically, we assess this by arranging the questions within each instruction in either descending (hard-first) or ascending (easy-last) order of difficulty, using the fail rate of R1-7B as a proxy for difficulty for problems in AIME24 and AIME25. As shown in Fig. 8, presenting questions from easy to hard consistently yields better overall accuracy compared to the reverse order. This discrepancy can be attributed to the tendency of LRMs to engage in lengthy and redundant reasoning processes when confronted with difficult questions early in the input.

### 6 Conclusion

In conclusion, we present REST, a stress testing framework designed to evaluate Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) in simultaneous multi-problem solving scenarios. REST significantly enhances the discriminative power of existing benchmarks that often suffer from performance saturation, revealing substantial performance differences among models that appear comparable in traditional singlequestion evaluations. Notably, even SOTA models like DeepSeek-R1 exhibit marked performance degradation under stress testing, challenging the common assumption that “LLMs are multi-problem solvers.” Additionally, REST uncovers a few reasoning misbehaviors, such as question omission and summary error, which remain obscure in single-question assessments. Critical findings, such as the identification of question position bias and the demonstrated effectiveness of long2short training, offer valuable insights for the future development of more robust and capable LRMs.

Figure 11: Evaluation prompt for code generation tasks.

### C Comparison between Rule-based and LLM-based Answer Extraction

In this section, we compare the performance of several representative LRMs under REST when using rule-based versus LLM-based answer extraction. For rule-based extraction, we search the specific pattern sequentially using code modified from Qwen-Math evaluation tool †. For the LLM-based approach, we employ gemma-3-27b-it [49] with prompt shown in Figure 12. The results in Table 4

†https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen2.5-Math

##### Prompt 4: Answer Extraction Promopt

Extract the final answers from the given predictions. Here are some extraction criteria:

- 1. Don’t try to answer the original question. Your task is to extract the final answer from the prediction as it is, even if it is incorrect.
- 2. Prediction sometimes involves lengthy thinking processes, you don’t need to consider these, just extract the final answer.
- 3. If there is question that has not been answered, don’t answer it yourself. You should set the final answer to None (e.g., \boxed{None}).
- 4. Ensure the number of final answers you extract is exactly the same as the number of the given questions.
- 5. Extract the final answer for each question one by one and enclose each final answer within an \boxed. For example, if there are three questions, the output should be

- Answer to Q1: \boxed{answer 1}
- Answer to Q2: \boxed{answer 2}
- Answer to Q3: \boxed{answer 3}. Here is your task. Simply extract the final answers from the given predictions. Don’t apologize or correct yourself if there was a mistake in the predictions; we are just trying to extract the final answer. <Questions Begin>: {question} <Questions End> <Predictions Begin>: {prediction} <Predictions End> Extract the final answers from the given predictions.

indicate that LLM-based answer extraction can lead to a modest performance improvement. However, this approach significantly increases evaluation costs and may introduce additional instability, making it less practical for large-scale assessments. Therefore, we adopt rule-based answer extraction as the default approach in our experiments.

### D The Impact of the maximum output length

Extending the maximum output length can not provide substantial improvement. As our error analysis identified output truncation as a significant error type, it is questionable whether extending the maximum output length could improve performance under stress tests. To evaluate this, we extended the maximum output length from 32K to 128K tokens for top-tier 7B∼32B reasoning models. As shown in Tab. 5, this extension has a negligible impact on stress test accuracy.

Max Output Token GSM8K MATH500 AMC23 AIME24 AIME25 DS-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B

32K 89.06 66.75 36.06 16.53 11.37 128K 89.37 65.83 36.66 16.17 11.73

DS-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B

32K 95.50 88.97 86.24 52.51 33.83 128K 95.62 89.71 86.77 52.75 33.87

- Table 5: The effect of extending the maximum output length. Extending the maximum output length has almost negligible impact on both 7B and 32B models.

### E Limitation

While REST provides a powerful and discriminative evaluation framework, several limitations remain. First, it increases evaluation costs, as multi-problem prompts generally require longer reasoning sequences, leading to increased computational overhead. Additionally, given the rapid pace of advancement in reasoning models, there is always a risk that our experiments may not capture all the latest state-of-the-art models released after our initial evaluations. To address this, we plan to continuously monitor newly released models and maintain an up-to-date leaderboard to reflect the latest progress in the field.

### F The Impact of Question Type

To further investigate the factors influencing model performance under stress testing, we analyze the effect of question types. Fig. 13 shows model performance across different stress levels for various types of math problems. We observe that both R1-7B and R1-32B exhibit similar trends. Specifically, performance degradation under stress is minimal for Algebra and Number Theory problems, indicating that models can handle multiple such questions in a single prompt without significant loss. In contrast, Pre-Calculus, Pre-Algebra, and Geometry questions show substantial drops in accuracy under stress, even for the more capable R1-32B model. Notably, this performance degradation is not always correlated with single-question accuracy. For example, under stress level 1 (i.e., single-question setting), R1-32B achieves 98.21% accuracy on Pre-Calculus, higher than 94.31% on Pre-Algebra. However, at stress level 9, its Pre-Calculus accuracy drops to 90.71%, falling below the 92.51% accuracy on Pre-Algebra. This indicates that performance degradation under stress is not solely determined by problem difficulty, but also influenced by question type.

### G Error Type Illustrations

In this section, we provide a detailed case study of each error type under stress tests in figures 14 to 18. Our findings indicate that Output Truncation is not the only reason for the performance degradation

###### Example G.1: Example of Output Truncation Query:

- Q1: Let O(0, 0), A(21, 0), and B(0,

√3

2 ) be points in the coordinate plane. Let F be the family of segments PQ of unit length lying in the first quadrant with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. There is a unique point C on AB, distinct from A and B, that does not belong to any segment from F other than AB. Then OC2 = qp, where p and q are relatively prime positive integers. Find p + q.

- Q2: Find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) satisfying a + b + c = 300 and a2b + a2c + b2a + b2c + c2a + c2b = 6,000,000. Answer the above questions one by one. Remember to put your final answer within \boxed{}.

Response: Okay, so I have these two problems to solve. Let me start with the first one.

- Problem Q1: We have points O(0,0), A(1/2, 0), and B(0, sqrt(3)/2). The family F consists of segments PQ of unit length in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. We need to find a unique point C on AB (other than A and B) that doesn’t lie on any other segment from F except AB. Then compute OC² and express it as a reduced fraction p/q, and find p+q. Alright, let’s break this down. First, let’s visualize the points. O is the origin, A is (1/2, 0), which is halfway between (0,0) and (1,0). B is (0, sqrt(3)/2), which is halfway between (0,0) and (0,1) in some sense, but sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.866. So, AB is a line segment connecting (1/2, 0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2). Let me compute the equation of line AB.

- . . . (Reasoning content for Q1) . . . So, to find such a point C, we need to find a point on AB that is not on any other PQ, which are all lines from (p,0) to (0, q) with p + q = 1.

Problem Q2: Find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) satisfying a + b + c = 300 and ab + ac + ba + bc + ca + cb = 6,000,000. Okay, so we have two equations:

- . . . (Reasoning content for Q2) . . . Thus, each non-symmetric set is unique, so 6 such sets, each contributing 6 ordered triples 36. Plus the symmetric solution 1. Total=37. But, in reality, the equation may have more solutions. Wait, let me think. Wait, the equation is:(a(b + c) + b(c + a) + c(a + b))/2006 = abc. So, with (Truncated)

###### Example G.2: Example of Endless Repetiion Query:

- Q1: Let ABCD be a tetrahedron such that AB = CD = √41, AC = BD = √80, and BC = AD = √89. There exists a point I inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from I to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are

all equal. This distance can be written in the form m

√n p , where m, n, and p are positive integers, m and p are

relatively prime, and n is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find m + n + p.

- Q2: Let p be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer n such that n4 + 1 is divisible by p2. Find the least positive integer m such that m4 + 1 is divisible by p2. Answer the above questions one by one. Remember to put your final answer within \boxed{}.

###### Response:

Problem√41, ACQ1:andWeBDhaveare botha tetrahedron√80, and BCABCDandwithAD aresomebothspecific√89. There’sedge lengths.a pointTheI insideedgesthisABtetrahedronand CD are suchboth that the distances from I to each face are equal. We need to find this distance, express it in a specific form, and then compute m + n + p where the distance is m√n/p. Hmm, okay. So, first, I remember that in a tetrahedron, the point equidistant from all four faces is called the incenter, similar to the incenter of a triangle. The distance from this point to each face is the inradius.

- . . . (Reasoning content for Q1) . . . Wait, 236? Hmm, that seems a bit high, but maybe it’s correct. Wait, let me check the formula for the inradius again. Yes, for a tetrahedron, r = 3V/A, where A is the total surface area. So, yes, that’s correct. Alternatively, another way to compute the inradius is to note that in a disphenoid, the inradius can be computed using the

formula r = (3V)/Atotal, which is what I did. So, I think 236 is the answer for Q1. Problem Q2: We need to find the least prime number p such that there exists a positive integer n where p2 divides n4 + 1. Once we find that prime p, we need to find the least positive integer m such that m4 + 1 is divisible by p2. So, first, we need to find the smallest prime p where p2 | n4 + 1 for some n. To do this, I think we can consider primes p where −1 is a quartic residue modulo p2. Because n4 ≡ −1 mod p2, which implies that n4 + 1 ≡ 0 mod p2. Therefore, we need to find the smallest prime p such that the equation x4 ≡ −1 mod p2 has a solution. Alternatively, since if x4 ≡ −1 mod p2, then x4 ≡ −1 mod p, so first, we can check for primes p where −1 is a quartic residue modulo p.

- Q2: Alice chooses a set A of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers with the property that the maximum element of B belongs to A. Bob’s list has 2024 sets. Find the sum of the elements of A. Answer the above questions one by one. Remember to put your final answer within \boxed{}.

Response: Alright, so I have these two math problems to solve. Let me start with Q1. It says: “Let N be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Let Q and R be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when N is divided by 1000. Find Q + R.” Okay, so N is a four-digit number, and if you change any one of its digits to 1, the new number is divisible by 7. We need to find N, then divide it by 1000 to get Q and R, and then add them together. First, let me think about how to approach this. Since changing any digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7, that gives us several conditions. Let’s denote N as a four-digit number: N = ABCD, where A, B, C, D are its digits. Then, changing each digit one by one to 1 should result in a number divisible by 7. So, changing A to 1: 1BCD should be divisible by 7. Changing B to 1: A1CD should be divisible by 7.

. . . (Reasoning content for Q1) . . . After checking various possibilities, we find that the valid number N is 5694. When N = 5694 is divided by 100, the quotient Q is 56 and the remainder R is 94. Therefore, we compute Q + 10R:

Q + 10R = 56 + 10 × 94 = 56 + 940 = 996 Thus, the final answer is

The word ROOT has 4 letters with two O’s. The distinct letters are R, O, O, T. 2. We treat the pair DE as a single letter, resulting in three units: DE, R, T. 3. These three units can be arranged in 3! = 6 ways. 4. However, DE can also be treated as ED, so we multiply by 2, giving 12 ways. 5. Considering the two O’s, the total number of distinct arrangements is 12. Thus, the number

Response: Okay, so I have these two problems to solve, Q1 and Q2. Let me try to tackle them one by one. I’ll start with Q1 because it seems a bit more straightforward, even though I might need to think carefully. Problem Q1:

Alright, so we have triangle ABC with two circles tangent to sides AB and BC respectively, each of radius 34. Then, there are 2024 circles of radius 1 arranged in the same manner. We need to find the inradius of triangle ABC expressed as a fraction m/n, where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. So, I recall that when circles are tangent to sides of a triangle and each other, it often relates to similar triangles or some kind of geometric progression. Maybe it’s something to do with the inradius being built up by smaller circles?

- . . . (Reasoning content for Q1) . . . Alternatively, maybe it’s the geometric mean, (34 ∗ 1) = √34, but that’s irrational. But since the problem states that the inradius can be expressed as m/n, where m and n are coprime integers, 35 is a reasonable answer. So, perhaps the answer is 35, so m + n = 36. Therefore, after all this thinking, I think the inradius is 35, so the answer is 36. Final Answer Now, moving on to problem 2. We have the function f(x) = 75+114+2xx−x2 , and we need to find the maximum value of the expression (75+f117(i)i−−4144j) where i and j are complex numbers with |i| = |j| = 4. First, I need to understand what is being asked. We have a complex expression, and we need to find its maximum value as i and j range over complex numbers with magnitude 4. So, let me denote z = i, w = j, with |z| = |w| = 4. Then, the expression becomes: 75+117z−144w

|36|
|---|

f(z)−4

- . . . (Reasoning content for Q2) . . . Wait, maybe the maximum is 15, so the answer is 15, sum is 16. But to be honest, given that my calculations are not consistent, maybe the answer is 15. But to end, I think the maximum value is 15, so 15/1, so 15 + 1 = 16.
