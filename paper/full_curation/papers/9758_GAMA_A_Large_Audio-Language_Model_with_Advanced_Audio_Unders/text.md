###### Abstract

Perceiving and understanding non-speech sounds and non-verbal speech is essential to making decisions that help us interact with our surroundings. In this paper, we propose GAMA, a novel General-purpose Large AudioLanguage Model (LALM) with Advanced Audio Understanding and Complex Reasoning Abilities. We build GAMA by integrating an LLM with multiple types of audio representations, including features from a custom Audio Q-Former, a multi-layer aggregator that aggregates features from multiple layers of an audio encoder. We fine-tune GAMA on a largescale audio-language dataset, which augments it with audio understanding capabilities. Next, we propose CompA-R (Instruction-Tuning for Complex Audio Reasoning), a synthetically generated instruction-tuning (IT) dataset with instructions that require the model to perform complex reasoning on the input audio. We instruction-tune GAMA with CompA-R to endow it with complex reasoning abilities, where we further add a soft prompt as input with high-level semantic evidence by leveraging event tags of the input audio. Finally, we also propose CompA-R-test, a human-labeled evaluation dataset for evaluating the capabilities of LALMs on open-ended audio questionanswering that requires complex reasoning. Through automated and expert human evaluations, we show that GAMA outperforms all other LALMs in literature on diverse audio understanding tasks by margins of 1%-84%. Further, GAMA IT-ed on CompA-R proves to be superior in its complex reasoning and instruction following capabilities.

Figure 1: Comparison of existing LALMs (LTU by Gong et al. (2024) here) and GAMA. With improved audio understanding abilities (via diverse audio feature integration) and training on our proposed CompA-R, GAMA can provide more detailed captions of input audio and is also able to answer questions regarding it that demand complex reasoning.

spoken language understanding tasks, like automatic speech recognition, have had a long history of benefiting from language comprehension with (L)LMs (Watanabe et al., 2018; Hu et al., 2024), the ability to improve the perception and understanding of non-speech sounds and non-verbal speech through language has been less explored (from hereon we refer to these kinds of audios or sound as “audio” in the paper). Beyond visual and language perception, the ability to understand audio is unarguably important and necessary for autonomous agents to interact with the world.

Contrastive Language Audio Pre-training (CLAP) (Elizalde et al., 2023a) was one of the first Audio-Language Models (ALM) to improve audio understanding through a language interface. Following this, several attempts have been made to improve CLAP and its reasoning abilities (Ghosh et al., 2024b). On the other hand, Deshmukh et al. propose Pengi, a pre-trained decoder-only LLM coupled with an audio-encoder, that can solve all kinds of audio tasks by framing them

as open-ended text-generation tasks. Similarly, Large Audio Language Models (LALMs) like LTU (Gong et al., 2024) and SALMONN (Tang et al., 2024) follow a similar architecture and attempt to solve audio tasks by empowering the model with instruction following capabilities (Wei et al., 2022). Specifically, all audio tasks are first framed in instruction-response pairs. The model is then fine-tuned on these pairs to learn audio reasoning and, thereby, instruction following. As an emergent ability, these models also show remarkable capabilities in open-ended question answering by reasoning over the input audio. However, two significant problems still persist: (1) All these models employ simple connection modules between the audio encoder and the language decoder to enable the latter with audio understanding capabilities. This hinders comprehensive multimodal connection and alignment, thereby increasing the risk of hallucinations and leading to suboptimal performance (Liu et al., 2023a). (2) Complex reasoning with LALMs is still under-explored. While these models excel at audio event detection (in various forms like captioning, event classification, etc.) and information-seeking questions (e.g., close-ended audio questions like

“How many birds are squawking?”), they fail to provide a faithful response for questions involving complex reasoning like “Identifying the context of laughter and its relationship with the automotive sounds in the recording. Draw a conclusion on the possible scenario occurring.”. We define complex reasoning for LALMs in Section 3.2 and show examples in Fig. 1 and Fig. 4.

Main Contributions. Our primary contributions are as follows:

• A Novel LALM. We introduce GAMA, an LALM with advanced audio understanding and complex reasoning abilities. To improve audio perception and understanding abilities, we propose integrating an LLM with multiple types of audio features that encode diverse aspects of information about the input audio. Specifically, we couple the output features from an Audio Q-Former and an Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST) (Gong et al., 2021), where the AST is further equipped with an aggregation module. While the Audio QFormer possesses impressive semantic generalization capabilities (Li et al., 2023), the AST possesses strong knowledge of surface-level

audio properties. Additionally, inspired by the fact that different layers in audio models learn audio information at different scales (Singla et al., 2022), the aggregation module aggregates the features from multiple layers of AST, which helps encode diverse knowledge. Both representations are passed through MLP layers that connect these features into the word embedding space before adding them as the prefix. As a result, GAMA possesses improved audio understanding capabilities by moving away from the simple coupling of audio encoders and linear layers commonly employed as connection modules to align the audio and textual modalities, which generally suffer from comprehensive multimodal alignment (Liu et al., 2023a). GAMA is first finetuned on a large-scale audio-language corpus, and the resulting model outperforms all other models on standard audio and music understanding benchmarks.

- • A Novel Instruction Tuning Dataset. To endow an LALM with complex reasoning abilities, we propose CompA-R, a dataset synthetically generated with multi-aspect information and human-written in-context examples. Specifically, we prompt GPT to synthesize an instruction-response pair by guiding it with various metadata related to the audio.
- • A Novel Evaluation Dataset. To evaluate an LALM’s complex reasoning abilities, we develop CompA-R-test, a human-labeled benchmark. Specifically, CompA-R-test evaluates an LALM on open-ended AQA that demands complex reasoning over the audio. GAMA-IT (GAMA fine-tuned on CompA-R) shows significant improvements on CompA-R-test over all other baselines from literature.

###### 2 Related Work

Large Multi-Modal and Audio-Language Models. Prior to the exploration of LLMs as efficient reasoners, encoder-based multi-modal language models, trained to learn a shared space between language and other modalities, have shown great promise. For example, CLAP, inspired by CLIP (Radford et al., 2021) in vision, showed stateof-the-art performance on audio-language tasks like retrieval, zero-shot classification, etc.

Input Audio

Figure 2: Illustration of GAMA. The GAMA architecture involves integrating various audio features with a text-only (pre-trained) LLM. The audio features are added as a prefix to the text instruction (by the user), and the LLM responds using a text output. We feed GAMA with 3 different types of audio features: ⃝1 The Multi-Layer Aggregator that takes as input features from the last and multiple other layers of the AST and calculates cross-attention to output a feature that encodes diverse surface features from audio. ⃝2 The pre-trained Audio Q-Former takes as input the last layer features of AST and outputs a feature that encodes the audio into a semantically rich and generalized space. ⃝3 After fine-tuning, we instruction-tune this model on our proposed CompA-R and further feed the model with a soft prompt with audio tags from AST (with an added classification head). This additional information serves as high-level semantic knowledge to improve complex reasoning abilities.

LLMs pre-trained at an incredible scale with the next token prediction objective implicitly compress world knowledge in their parameters (Zhao et al., 2023). These models learn general-purpose representations, which can then be aligned with the desired response characteristics (Zhang et al.,

- 2023). Instruction Tuning (IT), the process of finetuning an LLM with instruction-response pairs, has proved to be one of the most popular forms of alignment. Recent work shows that LLMs can also be instruction-tuned for multi-modal alignment. LLaVa (Liu et al., 2024), a pioneering work on multi-modal vision-language alignment, showed that fine-tuning an LLM on visual instructionresponse pairs with additional vision features as prefix can endow the model with visual reasoning and understanding abilities. Several works following LLaVa improve aspects of LVLMs and have achieved impressive performance on several visionlanguage tasks (Zhang et al., 2024). On the other hand, LALMs like LTU and SALMONN showed impressive performance on several audio-language tasks by reasoning over the audio. Though these models extensively evaluate several closed- and open-ended tasks, their ability to perform complex reasoning is largely under-explored.

Instruction Tuning and Complex Reasoning. ITbased alignment has also shown significant improvements for LLMs on Natural Language Understanding tasks, unlocking impressive capabilities (Bubeck et al., 2023), suggesting that finetuning is key to building and improving LLMbased agents. Very recently, (Xu et al., 2024) and (Cui and Wang, 2024) show that well-curated IT data can improve various reasoning capabilities in LLMs, like logical, mathematical, complex reasoning, etc. More specifically, IT teaches LLMs better and more effective methods to reason about a problem, presented in the input instruction (like step-by-step reasoning (Kojima et al., 2022)).

###### 3 Methodology

In the next sub-sections, we first describe the GAMA architecture and its components in detail, followed by fine-tuning GAMA on audio-language pairs, CompA-R creation, and instruction-tuning GAMA on CompA-R.

###### 3.1 GAMA Architecture

Fig. 2 illustrates the architecture of GAMA. GAMA builds on the same base architecture proposed in

prior works (Gong et al., 2024) but introduces several novel components for improving audio perception. More specifically, we feed the pre-trained LLM with features from multiple audio encoders, including a pre-trained Audio-Q-Former and a pretrained AST that encode diverse audio knowledge. Additionally, unlike prior work, we do not just use the last layers of the AST but couple it with a multilayer aggregator that takes features from multiple layers as input and outputs a feature that is aware of various low-level and high-level properties of the input audio. Finally, to endow the model with effective complex reasoning abilities, we employ AST again to extract high-level semantic knowledge, i.e., audio event tags, as supplementary information.

###### 3.1.1 Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST)

Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST), was one of the first attempts to model audio signals with a pure Transformer network. We employ an AST model fine-tuned on the AudioSet dataset. AST has been employed as an audio encoder and a feature extractor in a wealth of prior works due to its high informativeness (Gong et al., 2023, 2024). To extract the last-layer features, we drop the audio classification head and employ it only for event classification for soft prompts.

###### 3.1.2 Audio Q-Former

Motivation. Our primary goal is to integrate GAMA with an audio encoder that possesses strong semantic generalization capabilities for any input audio. Prior work has extensively explored CLAPstyle training for learning audio-language encoders. However, other methods and architectures have rarely been explored. As a more powerful alternative, we explore the Q-Former architecture proposed by (Li et al., 2023).

Architecture. The architecture of our Audio QFormer is based on the Querying Transformer proposed in Li et al. (2023), which is initialized from BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) and has Q querying tokens. We employ AST as the audio encoder (in place of the ViT-based vision encoder) and keep the rest of the architecture the same. Similar to the original implementation, we train the model in two stages. For the first stage, we solve three tasks, namely the Audio-Text Matching loss, the AudioGrounded Text Generation loss, and the AudioText Contrastive Learning loss. For the second stage, we employ LLaMa-2 7B as the language decoder and solve the language-modeling loss. For

training, we use 2.5M+ audio-caption pairs (detailed in Section E.2). For architectural details, we refer our readers to Li et al. (2023).

Training with Caption Augmentation. Additionally, due to the lack of large-scale audio caption pairs, we adopt a caption-augmentation methodology to augment the existing audios with diverse additional captions. More specifically, we instruct an LLM to generate k rewrites of the original caption. We employ two different prompts that rewrite the input caption with two different objectives:

Prompts. For Prompt 1, our primary aim is that the resultant rewrite should describe each acoustic event in the caption similarly but more vividly. These augmentations help the model learn various distinctive characteristics of the audio concepts corresponding to the acoustic events. For Prompt 1, our primary aim is such that the resultant rewrite should describe each acoustic event in the caption differently from the original caption. These augmentations aid the model in understanding the diverse linguistic expressions that can describe a single audio concept. We show examples below: (more examples in Table 11):

- (1) Original Caption: Someone made a cool vocal for a dubstep track.

- (1) Rewritten Caption by Prompt 1: A captivating vocal performance ignites the dubstep track, delivering a hypnotic and enthralling sound that reverberates through the air.
- (1) Rewritten Caption by Prompt 2: The dubstep track features a slick, stylish vocal performance that adds a layer of sophistication to its heavy beats and basslines.

- (2) Original Caption: Someone eating crisps and talking.

- (2) Rewritten Caption by Prompt 1: Crunchy crisps mingle with the sound of a lively conversation, creating a cozy and intimate atmosphere.
- (2) Rewritten Caption by Prompt 2: The crunch of crisps and the rustle of papers create a cozy, intimate atmosphere, accompanied by the gentle hum of a conversation.

During training, for each audio sample, we choose the original caption with a probability p = 0.4 or one of the rewritten versions (with a probability 1 − p), where each rewritten caption has an equal probability of selection. Both instrcutions are provided in Appendix B. We employ LLaMa2-13B (Touvron et al., 2023) with human-written

in-context examples. We randomly sample 5 incontext examples from a collection of 50.

###### 3.1.3 Multi-Layer Aggregator

Motivation. To extract additional details about the input audio, we devise a multi-layer aggregator that integrates multi-level hidden features of the pre-trained AST. Although AST has a global reception field in all layers, different layers learn auditory information at different scales (Singla et al.,

- 2022), i.e., the middle layers encode more generic features (e.g., basic sounds, textures), while deeper layers capture high-level concepts (e.g., speech intonations, complex sound patterns). By aggregating these features, the multi-layer aggregator outputs features that encode a more holistic and fine-grained understanding of the audio. Thus, our multi-layer aggregator makes fine-grained auditory knowledge more likely to be learned while training. Architecture. Our multi-layer aggregator is a transformer-style network consisting of two transformer layers for aggregating the hidden features of the audio encoder. Given the hidden features

Aj and Ak from the middle layers in the audio encoder, the aggregation module uses two blocks to sequentially integrate the former two features with the last layer feature Ai. Each block B is composed of self-attention, cross-attention, and Feed-forward network (FFN) arranged in a sequential manner. Finally, the output features A¯ is generated as follows,

A¯ = B2 (B1 (Ai; Aj) ; Ak) (1)

B(X; Y ) = FFN(Cross-Attn(Attn(X), Y )). (2)

In practice, we employ j = 4 and k = 8 from AST as our input to the multi-layer aggregator.

###### 3.1.4 Soft Prompt

Motivation. Though models like AST and Audio Q-Former have shown much promise in audio tasks, a major problem still exists: real-world audio generally has multiple and overlapping acoustic events, and understanding all such events from model features proves to be inherently complex (Ghosh et al.,

- 2024b). This eventually leads to sub-optimal performance for complex reasoning, where the explicit knowledge of plausible acoustic events in the audio can improve model responses. Thus, to improve fine-grained audio perception capabilities, we augment GAMA with high-level semantic understanding of the input audio. To do this, we employ an off-the-shelf audio model to extract high-level

semantic knowledge, i.e., audio event tags, as supplementary information. However, as audio event classification is not a solved problem, errors in tag predictions are inevitable. Thus, to mitigate the potential adverse effects of inaccurate predictions, we are inspired by prompt tuning to introduce a soft prompting technique that enables the model to utilize the embedded tags within the instructions adaptively.

Architecture. Fig. 2 shows an example of how we design our soft prompt together with an instruction. Specifically, we construct a fixed instruction template where we add the audio event tags along with the soft prompt, where the soft prompt is a trainable vector. In contrast to standard prompt tuning, where the model activations are generally steered towards completing the task for which the prompt is optimized, in our version the direction is specified by a tailored input sentence, “According to <hint>, you are allowed to use or partially use the following tags:”, and “<hint>” will be replaced by the soft prompt. This design allows us to select valuable information from tags adaptively rather than serving a specific task, as seen in standard prompt tuning methods. We only employ the soft prompt in the instruction tuning for complex reasoning step and not in the fine-tuning step. We provide a rationale in Appendix C.1.

###### 3.1.5 Connection Module

We employ a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to connect audio features into the word embedding space. All features are passed through separate MLP layers before being added as prefixes to word embeddings of the text instruction prompt.

###### 3.2 CompA-R

Motivation. We define complex reasoning as the capability of an LALM to understand the input audio, every individual acoustic event in the audio, and reason the corresponding scene in which the audio might have occurred, such that it can infer nuanced relationships between them and its underlying contexts, thereby enabling it to draw sophisticated conclusions. We design CompA-R with the primary goal of endowing LALMs with complex reasoning abilities. We are motivated by the primary finding that current SOTA LALMs can only perform well in prompts that require describing the audio (e.g., Describe the audio) or reasoning-based prompts where identifying the acoustic events present in the audio would suffice

for a faithful response (e.g., What type of video can this audio be used for dubbing?). However, when posed with complex reasoning questions, these models often hallucinate or fail to provide a faithful response (see Fig. 4). Inspired by a wealth of prior work that shows how IT on well-curated datasets can align model behaviors for the execution of novel skills like reasoning and complex problem solving (Xu et al., 2024), we propose a systematic multi-stage pipeline to synthesize instructionresponse pairs for CompA-R. CompA-R trains a model to engage in complex reasoning by querying it with instructions that cannot be directly inferred by identifying individual audio events and would require analyzing each event and its context in relation to other scene elements and world knowledge.

Synthesis Pipeline. We employ the AudioSetstrong subset to synthesize CompA-R. Our data synthesis pipeline consists of 3 stages: i) Caption Generation. To generate a caption that is aware of both the audio and the visual scene, we feed GPT-4 with multiple types of information about the audio and its corresponding video. These include a caption of the middle frame of the video generated using BLIP-2 (Li et al., 2023), objects in the frame identified using Grounding DINO (Liu et al.,

- 2023c), image labels for the frame using the ImageNet (Deng et al., 2009) ontology obtained from CLIP, environment context using PlaceCNN (Zhou et al., 2017), caption of the audio obtained using RECAP (Ghosh et al., 2024a) and audio event tags using the AudioSet ontology obtained from AST. Finally, we prompt GPT-4 to aggregate these descriptions into a comprehensive caption. ii) Dataset Synthesis. We pass the generated caption together with the ground-truth acoustic event information and their corresponding time slices to GPT-4. We prompt GPT-4 with 3 human-written exemplars (which are randomly sampled from a pool of 50 exemplars) to synthesize an instruction-response pair. The exemplars and prompt are designed such that the synthesized instructions demand complex reasoning. We synthesize a total of 25000 instructionresponse pairs. iii) Human Verification. We discard instructions due to untended noise and hallucinations. We, the authors of this paper, manually verify a subset of CompA-R corresponding to 500 unique audios for creating the test set, i.e., CompA-R-test. The remainder of the synthesized dataset is used as the training set. We describe the process and annotation details further in Ap-

We then instruct GPT-4 to generate instruction-response pairs where the instruction is accompanied by human-written exemplars (prompt in Fig. 5). To generate the test set, we perform expert human verification for a subset of the generated dataset.

###### 3.3 Training

Fine-tuning. We fine-tune GAMA on the OpenAQA training set released by Gong et al. (2024). We use a faction of all the instances due to the unavailability of the entire AudioSet and resource constraints. Dataset details are provided in Appendix H.1. Additionally, we augmented OpenAQA with 4 more datasets, including MusicCaps, MusicQA, NSynth, and Magna, to improve its music understanding capabilities. For fine-tuning, we follow the exact same 4-stage method proposed by Gong et al. (2024) where all parameters of all encoders are trainable, and we train only the LoRA modules of the LLM. We request our readers to refer to Gong et al. (2024) for more details.

Instruction Tuning on CompA-R. Post finetuning, we instruction-tune GAMA on CompA-R to endow it with complex reasoning abilities. Following common conventions (Liu et al., 2023b), we fine-tuned only the LoRA modules. We call the Instruction Tuned GAMA as GAMA-IT. Although fine-tuning on AQA also endows GAMA with instruction-following capabilities, CompA-R differs in the nature of training instances (thereby the capabilities it endows), and thus, we differentiate with such a naming convention for ease of reading.

###### 3.4 Experimental Setup

Hyper-parameters. For the fine-tuning stage, we follow the exact same hyper-parameter setup proposed by Gong et al. (2024). However, we scale down our batch sizes to 4, 2, 2, and 2 (due to compute constraints) with an effective batch size of 256 in all stages. For Instruction Tuning, we employ a batch size of 2, an effective batch size of 256, and a learning rate of 1e-4. For both training and evaluation, we sampled audio at 16kHz.

Baselines. We compare GAMA with i) generationbased LALMs: LTU, Qwen-Audio, SALMONN, Pengi and AudioGPT. We only employ the original checkpoints open-sourced by the authors and do not re-train the models due to compute constraints (except LTU, which we retrain on our version of OpenAQA, the same batch size as GAMA, and with LLaMa-2 as the LLM). We do not compare with Audio Flamingo (Kong et al., 2024) as the checkpoint was not available at the time of writing the paper, and we are constrained by compute for training it from scratch. ii) audio-language encoders: CLAP by Wu* et al. (2023b) and Elizalde et al. (2023b), CompA-CLAP (Ghosh et al., 2024b), AudioCLIP (Guzhov et al., 2021) and Audio QFormer. For dense captioning and close- and openended AQA, we evaluate using GAMA-IT. For all other tasks, we evaluate using the only fine-tuned

version of GAMA (rationale in Appendix C).

Evaluation Datasets and Metrics. Evaluation metrics used for all evaluation datasets are mentioned in Table 2 and detailed statistics about each dataset is mentioned in Section H.2. For classification, zero-shot evaluation refers to datasets GAMA that have never been seen during training; weak zero-shot evaluation refers to datasets GAMA that have not been seen in training but are sourced from the same project as part of the training data, and seen datasets refer to datasets GAMA has been trained on. Similar to Deshmukh et al. (2023); Gong et al. (2024), we first caption the audio and retrieve the most similar label using SentenceBERT. We employ either accuracy (Acc), Micro-F1 (MiF1), or Mean Average Precision (mAP) for classification evaluation. For captioning, we also propose dense captioning, which evaluates a model for its capability to identify every event in the audio and the context of its occurrence with respect to other events in the audio (more in Section 4). For evaluation, we randomly select a subset of 500 samples from AudioCaps and Clotho. We also employ human evaluation for OpenAQA, CompA-R-test, and dense captioning. For human evaluation, we ask human annotators to score the caption on a scale of 1-5 and report the score averaged across the 3. More details on recruitment and background of an-

Question: Based on the given audio, infer the type of environment or setting. Consider the presence and duration of car sounds.

Question: Considering the correlation of the man's speech and the music, infer his possible connection to the music playing in the scene.

The audio clip suggests an urban or suburban environment with a mix of residential and commercial areas. The presence of car sounds suggests that the environment is a busy one.

The male speaker's speech adds a sense of authority and control to the event's atmosphere, as well as a sense of urgency or importance to the crowd's reactions. The speech also provides a contrast to the music and crowd reactions, creating a dynamic and engaging soundscape that draws the listener's attention and emotions.

The given audio suggests that the environment or setting is a busy city street with a lot of car traffic. The audio also indicates that the car sounds are continuous and long-lasting. Therefore, it can be inferred that the audio is from a busy city street with a lot of car traffic.

The male speaker is interspersed with the music and crowd reactions to create a dynamic and engaging atmosphere at the event. His speech adds energy and excitement to the event, keeps the audience engaged and involved, and helps create a memorable and enjoyable experience for all attendees.

Figure 4: Qualitative comparison of GAMA with other baselines on instances from CompA-R-test. Both instances challenge an LALM with a question about the input audio that requires advanced understanding and complex reasoning regarding the audio and its individual events. GAMA is able to provide faithful and accurate responses through improved audio perception and reasoning capabilities. HE refers to scores assigned by human evaluators. Note that the video is only provided for illustration purposes and not provided as input to the LALM. More examples here: https://gamaaudio.github.io/gamaaudio/

notators can be found in Appendix D. Finally, due to human evaluation being prohibitively expensive, we also propose an automated evaluation methodology for complex open-ended AQA on CompA-Rtest. We evaluate model responses using text-only GPT-4, where we provide it with the audio caption generated in Section 3.2 and the gold-standard audio event with timestamps (prompt in Appendix B).

###### 4 Results and Analysis

Quantitative Results. Table 1 compares GAMA with other baselines on classification and captioning tasks. For zero-shot classification evaluation on VocalSound (VS) (Gong et al., 2022), TUT 2017 (TUT) (Mesaros et al., 2018), Beijing Opera (BJO) (Tian et al., 2014), GTZAN (GTZ) (Park et al., 2022) and Medley-solos-DB (MDB) (Lostanlen et al., 2018), GAMA outperforms our baselines by 2%-67%. For weak zero-shot evaluation on ESC-50 (Piczak, 2015) and DCASE2017 Task 4 (DCASE) (Mesaros et al., 2017), GAMA outperforms our baselines by 1%-66%. Finally, for in-domain evaluation on VGGSound (VGG) (Chen et al., 2020), FSD50K (FSD) (Fonseca et al., 2021), AudioSet (AS) (Gemmeke et al., 2017) and NSynth (NS) (Engel et al., 2017) GAMA outperforms our baselines by 1%-84%. GAMA sees the steepest drop in performance when the AST and Aggregator are removed (i.e., only Auio Q-Former is employed).

- Table 2 compares GAMA with other baselines

on AQA (open-ended and complex open-ended) and dense captioning. GAMA outperforms all our baselines on all settings. GAMA shows absolute im-

provement of 4% - 50% on OpenAQA, 8% - 58% on CompA-R-test and 8% - 30% on Dense Captioning. Similar to the tasks in Table 1, performance on benchmarks suffers the most when without the Audio Q-Former (when only the AST and Aggregator are employed). Audio Q-Former proves to especially effective (over employing CLAP) in AQA.

Qualitative Results. Fig. 4 compares GAMA-IT against other LALMs from literature with instances from CompA-R-test. All models compared by default possess audio chat or open-ended AQA capabilities. GAMA-IT is able to provide more faithful responses that are both correct and preferred more by humans. We provide additional comparisons in Figs. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and our demo page: (where we also show comparisons of dense captioning).

###### 5 Conclusion

In this paper, we propose GAMA, an LALM with improved audio perception abilities. We integrate an LLM with multiple types of audio representations, which are responsible for providing diverse knowledge about the input audio. GAMA fine-tuned on a mixture of open-source datasets outperforms prior audio-language models by significant margins on 16 datasets spanning 4 tasks. Next, we propose CompA-R, an instruction-tuning dataset that we synthesize using a robust pipeline for endowing an LALM with complex reasoning abilities. GAMA ITed on CompA-R outperforms baselines on complex open-ended AQA and dense captioning.

###### Limitations and Future Work

GAMA and our experimental setup have several limitations, including:

- • For the scope of our experiments, we do not evaluate and compare music understanding extensively. We do not do this as we do not train GAMA on diverse and large-scale music datasets. We also acknowledge that it is possible to employ the GAMA architecture for comprehensive music understanding if trained on large-scale music understanding datasets. As part of future work, we plan to release a musiconly version of GAMA, similar to Gardner et al.

(2024).

- • We do not employ larger LLMs, for example, the 13B versions of the LLaMA family, similar to Tang et al. (2024) and Gong et al.

(2024), due to compute constraints.

- • The audio-encoder(s) in GAMA have more parameters than in our baselines. However, we also acknowledge that this adds to only a fraction of the total parameter count of the LALM.

Fig. 5 illustrates the prompt employed for synthesizing CompA-R. Fig. 6 illustrates the prompt employed for evaluating model responses on CompA-R. For dense captioning, we just prompt the model: Write an audio caption describing the sound in detail.

- C GAMA-IT vs GAMA and Evaluation Choices.

GAMA is first fine-tuned on OpenAQA and then instruction-tuned on CompA-R for complex reasoning. We call the instruction-tuned version GAMA-IT. We do not evaluate GAMA-IT on general tasks like classification and vanilla captioning 1. GAMA-IT is aligned to generate detailed descriptions as part of the complex reasoning stage, and we found a lack of metrics and methods that can faithfully evaluate such descriptions for classification or captioning. For example, the retrievalbased classification evaluation method, employed extensively in prior work, including ours, uses a Sentence-BERT to retrieve the label closest to the description for classification evaluation. During our preliminary analysis, we found that SentenceBERT, which just performs retrieval using semantic matching, is unable to faithfully retrieve the correct label despite the caption mentioning the label as an audio event. We further investigated CLAP as our retrieval model for evaluation and found that it suffers from the same limitations. We attribute this to the detailed and dense nature of the descriptions and the fact that these models only focus on high-level semantic meaning for retrieval. Our initial experiments show that LLM prompting serves as a feasible alternative for automatic evaluation (beyond human evaluation) using such dense descriptions, but due to the lack of resources and a

1Note: Both depend on the description of the input audio generated by the model

formal framework, we leave this as part of future research.

###### C.1 Soft Prompts

We employ the soft prompt only in the instruction tuning stage for learning complex reasoning and not in the fine-tuning step. We do this for 2 reasons: (i) Fine-tuned GAMA is only expected to solve generic audio tasks like classification, captioning, etc. Thus, we hypothesize that such high-level semantic cues are not necessary for effective and optimal performance. (ii) Since fine-tuning is done on a large-scale dataset and acoustic event classification is far from accurate, our soft prompt method might add unwanted noise to the training process, thereby leading to sub-optimal performance. On the contrary, our instruction-tuning stage, which is done on relatively low-resource data and is only responsible for aligning a model for complex reasoning, is robust to inaccurate audio tags due to our soft-prompting methodology.

###### D Additional Details: Human Study

Note. Our institution’s Institutional Review Board (IRB) has granted approval for both human studies presented in the paper.

Background and Recruitment for Dense Captioning and CompA-R-test Evaluation. We recruit 3 professionals for human evaluation of dense captioning and CompA-R-test evaluation. All these 3 professionals come with at least a Ph.D. in Engineering or Sciences and were asked to use headphones to first analyze the audio and then judge the response quality. The authors of this paper gave these annotators 5 examples of responses and the corresponding judgments. The work was done voluntarily and not paid. We refrain from recruiting crowd raters as prior research has noticed discrepancies in evaluation by them (Gudibande et al., 2023). More precisely, they have been shown to possess a tendency to rate an answer with a high score only by visualizing the style of answering and not the exact factual information making up the response.

All 3 human annotators score the response between 1-5, and we report scores averaged across the 3. Prior to evaluation, all annotators were given at least 10 examples from the authors of the paper of generations and their corresponding scores. For evaluation, only the audio was provided to them with software that could play the audio and has

fields to input the scores.

Background and Recruitment for OpenAQA. Since the size of OpenAQA is relatively larger than CompA-R-test, we perform evaluation on Amazon Mechanical Turk similar to Gong et al. (2024). Evaluation was done with a total of 267 unique human evaluators and each generation was scored by 2 evaluators. The same software was used for evaluation as CompA-R-test.

###### E Additional Details: Audio Q-Former

###### E.1 Audio Q-Former Training Details

Pre-training Hyper-parameter. For Stage 1 of training, we employ a training batch size of 192, an initial learning rate of 1e-4, a minimum learning rate of 1e-5, and a warm-up learning rate of 1e-6. We do cosine decay as the learning rate scheduling technique. We do warmup for 5000 steps. Stage 1 was pre-trained on 8 A6000 GPUs for 100 epochs. For Stage 2 of training, we keep the exact same settings as Stage 1 but change the batch size to 128. Fine-tuning. For zero-shot audio classification evaluation, we fine-tune the Audio Q-Former after Stage 1 pre-training on the same corpus presented in Table 3 and using the same Stage 1 objective. The only difference in the fine-tuning step is that we train the AST model, which is otherwise kept frozen in the pre-training stage.

Fine-tuning Hyper-parameter. For fine-tuning, we again use the same hyper-parameter setting as Stage 1 pre-training but use a batch size of 64.

###### E.2 Training Dataset Details

###### E.3 Augmentation Examples

Table 9 illustrates prompt augmentations for two categories from each dataset. Table 10 illustrates caption augmentations for training Audio Q-Former.

###### F Baseline Details

AudioCLIP. (Guzhov et al., 2022) AudioCLIP is an extension of the CLIP model that can handle audio in addition to text and images by incorporating the ESResNeXt audio model in the CLIP framework. It was trained on the AudioSet dataset, which contains millions of audio clips with corresponding labels.

CLAP. (Elizalde et al., 2023a) CLAP (Contrastive Language-Audio Pre-training), similar to CLIP, is an audio-language model trained with contrastive learning between audio data and their corresponding natural language descriptions. Representations are obtained from audio encoders and text encoders. Wu* et al. (2023b) further extend this using a feature fusion mechanism and keyword-to-caption augmentation into the model design to further enable the model to process audio inputs of variable lengths and enhance performance.

CompA-CLAP. (Elizalde et al., 2023a) CompACLAP, an extension to CLAP, is trained on completely open-sourced datasets and further finetuned using specific algorithms and datasets to improve compositional reasoning.

Pengi. (Deshmukh et al., 2023) Pengi was one of the first efforts to achieve general-purpose audio understanding through free-form language generation with transfer learning. Precisely, Pengi integrates an audio encoder with a decoder-only pre-trained language model (LM) where the audio features

serve as a prefixes for the LM during response generation. Following this, similar to our evaluation strategy, they prompt the model to caption the input audio and calculate the similarity between the caption and the ground-truth audio label for zero-shot classification.

LTU. (Gong et al., 2024) As a concurrent work to Pengi, took a step forward and showed that substituting the pre-trained language model with an LLM can induce an LALM with reasoning capabilities. Precisely, they achieved this by integrating an audio encoder to LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023) and finetuning the model on close-ended and open-ended instruction-tuning datasets. Finally, beyond just close-ended tasks, they also evaluate their models on open-ended reasoning tasks and show superior performance compared to baselines.

AudioGPT. (Huang et al., 2024) Different from Pengi and LTU, AudioGPT differs in how the audio models and LLMs are integrated for completing audio tasks. More specifically, different from end-to-end training and alignment, they integrate a closed-source model (ChatGPT) with a pre-trained audio model, already capable of completing the required task, using a modality-transfer transformer τ. The integration or interaction between the two models is accomplished using the prompts. Additionally, AudioGPT is capable of solving more tasks, which include human verbal speech, beyond just non-verbal speech like Pengi and LTU.

SALMONN. (Tang et al., 2024) SALMONN follows a similar architecture to LTU and Pengi and does prefix conditioning with an LLM. However, in addition to an audio encoder, they also integrate a speech encoder for speech or verbal audio understanding. Precisely, the audio and speech features are concatenated before feeding them as prefixes to the LLM. SALMONN shows unique reasoning capabilities over speech inputs overlayed with nonverbal audio.

Qwen-Audio. (Chu et al., 2023) Qwen follows a similar architecture to LTU, Pengi, and SALMONN, i.e., adding audio features as prefix to the model, and additionally employs a novel multi-task learning formulation for pre-training. More specifically, they append specific tags to specific parts of the instruction-response text pairs and train the model on diverse speech, non-speech, and music tasks. Post-pre-training, similar to GAMA, employs an instruction-tuning stage for alignment. The resultant model, Qwen-Audio-Chat, is able

to respond to respond to diverse queries about the input speech and audio.

###### G Additional Details: CompA-R

- G.1 Annotation and Annotator Details

As mentioned earlier, CompA-R was cleaned and CompA-R-test was verified by the paper authors themselves. To preserve anonymity, we briefly provide some details about the authors. All authors of the paper are either enrolled in or have graduated from a graduate degree (MS and/or Ph.D.). All authors have at least 2 years of professional research experience at a academic or industry lab. Their research experience spans across speech, audio and language processing. This provides them with adequate knowledge to faithfully complete the process.

For CompA-R-test verification, after at least 3 authors verified the test set, with proper rationales (which they were also asked to provide) the lead author cross-verified all instances. The verification was done manually on local laptops and no kind of application was used which was made specifically for this. More details will be provided on cameraready.

# Prompt 1 I will provide you with 2 different types of information about a 10-second audio clip:

- 1. A list where each comma-separated element indicates the individual events occurring in the audio at various time segments. For example, '(Speech-

- 0.0-0.64)' would mean human speech between 0.0 second to 0.64 second.

2. A caption of the audio describing in a brief and abstract manner the scene in which the audio takes place. I want you to act as a Prompt Generator. According to the event information and the caption, design some instructions and corresponding responses. The instruction should be designed in a way such that it can be answered only from the audio without the caption and any other detail provided. The instruction should involve one or more hops of complex knowledge and complex reasoning based on the scene created by the audio and the correspnding caption. Ensure that the knowledge and reasoning chains in the instructions are precise and sufficiently challenging, to the extent that only welleducated people and experts in the respective field can provide adequate responses. The instructions must meet the following conditions:

- 1. Do NOT use phrases like 'according to the caption' in both the questions and answers; you should ask and answer as if you were observing the image by yourself.
- 2. The questions and answers should be as diverse as possible.
- 3. Please don't ask some simple questions about the intensity of the audio or the gender speaking the utterance; your questions must involve some knowledge.
- 4. Your instructions should not be answered directly based on the image and your instructions. Instead, it requires the test-taker to carefully observe the image and have a deep knowledge of the content within the image in order to answer correctly.
- 5. If a question cannot be answered, please do not ask.

Come up with 3 diverse instructions for the knowledge topics above with different language styles and accurate answers. The instructions should contain interrogative sentences and declarative sentences. The answers should be less than 30 words.

Caption Evaluation Prompt

I want you to act as a Caption Evaluator. I will provide you with an audio caption generated by an AI agent. The agent was asked to generate a dense and detailed caption of the audio. To evaluate the caption, I will provide you with 2 different types of information about the 10second audio clip:

- 1. A list where each comma-separated element indicates the individual events occurring in the audio at various time segments. For example, '(Speech-0.0-0.64)' would mean human speech between 0.0 second to 0.64 second.
- 2. A scene caption of the audio describing in a brief and abstract manner the scene in which the audio takes place. Using these two pieces of information, assign a score of 1-10 to the caption, where 1 is the lowest score and 10 is the highest score. Your evaluation should be based on the detailedness, correctness, and bluntness of the caption. Return a JSON with a single key 'score', where the value of the key is the score. Here are the details: {query}
