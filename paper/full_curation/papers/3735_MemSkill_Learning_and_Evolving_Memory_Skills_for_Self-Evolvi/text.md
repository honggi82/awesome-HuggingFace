##### Abstract

Most Large Language Model (LLM) agent memory systems rely on a small set of static, handdesigned operations for extracting memory. These fixed procedures hard-code human priors about what to store and how to revise memory, making them rigid under diverse interaction patterns and inefficient on long histories. To this end, we present MemSkill, which reframes these operations as learnable and evolvable memory skills, structured and reusable routines for extracting, consolidating, and pruning information from interaction traces. Inspired by the design philosophy of agent skills, MemSkill employs a controller that learns to select a small set of relevant skills, paired with an LLM-based executor that produces skillguided memories. Beyond learning skill selection, MemSkill introduces a designer that periodically reviews hard cases where selected skills yield incorrect or incomplete memories, and evolves the skill set by proposing refinements and new skills. Together, MemSkill forms a closed-loop procedure that improves both the skill-selection policy and the skill set itself. Experiments on LoCoMo, LongMemEval, HotpotQA, and ALFWorld demonstrate that MemSkill improves task performance over strong baselines and generalizes well across settings. Further analyses shed light on how skills evolve, offering insights toward more adaptive, self-evolving memory management for LLM agents.

##### 1. Introduction

As Large Language Model (LLM) agents engage in longer, open-ended interactions, they must handle growing histories that are essential yet challenging to leverage, motivating

memory for retaining experience and maintaining coherence (Hu et al., 2025). This need has driven rapid progress in agent memory, including approaches that summarize and retrieve past interactions or manage external memory stores (Kang et al., 2025; Chhikara et al., 2025; Packer et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2025). However, most methods still rely on static, hand-designed memory mechanisms, including fixed operation primitives (e.g., add/update/delete/skip) (Wang et al., 2025a; Yan et al., 2025) and heuristic modules that govern what to store, how to revise it (Kang et al., 2025; Fang et al., 2025), and when to prune it. Such designs bake in strong human assumptions and often suffer under diverse interaction patterns, scaling poorly as histories grow.

We argue that this formulation fundamentally limits the adaptability of agent memory. Rather than treating memory as the output of fixed operations or hand-designed modules, we propose to elevate memory extraction itself into a learnable abstraction. Concretely, we view memory construction as the outcome of applying a small set of generic, reusable memory skills: structured behaviors that specify when and how interaction traces should be transformed into memory and revised over time. This perspective reveals a key bottleneck of prior pipelines: they hard-code memory behaviors into fixed procedural workflows that interleave heuristics with LLM-mediated extraction and revision, making them brittle under distribution shift (Fang et al., 2025).

Under this view, an ideal agent memory system should satisfy three properties. (i) Minimal reliance on human priors. Instead of manually encoding what is worth remembering for a domain (Zhong et al., 2024), memory behaviors should be shaped by interaction data and updated as task demands evolve. (ii) Support for larger extraction granularity. Many approaches are tuned to a fixed unit, such as per-turn processing (Fang et al., 2025), and can weaken when applied to longer spans. A practical system should be able to operate at larger extraction granularity when needed. (iii) Skill-conditioned, compositional memory construction. Existing systems often decompose memory construction into specialized modules (Kang et al., 2025). In contrast, we prefer to select and compose a small set of relevant skills for the current context and apply them in one generation step, enabling flexible reuse and evolution of memory behaviors.

Based on the above observations, we introduce MemSkill,

- Figure 1. Comparison between (a) prior turn-level, handcrafted operations and (b) MemSkill’s span-level, skill-conditioned generation. Prior methods interleave handcrafted operations with LLM calls to incrementally extract and revise memory turn by turn, while MemSkill selects a small set of skills from a shared skill bank and applies them in one pass to produce skill-guided memories.

which reframes memory operations as a learnable and evolvable set of memory skills. MemSkill maintains a shared skill bank, where each skill captures a reusable way to extract, consolidate, or revise memories from interaction text (Figure 1 shows the structured template of a memory skill). Given the current context, a controller learns to select a small set of relevant skills, and an LLM-based executor conditions on these skills to generate skill-guided memories in one pass. This skill-conditioned formulation is not tied to a fixed extraction unit and can be applied to different span lengths when processing long interaction histories.

Crucially, MemSkill goes beyond learning how to use a fixed set of skills. We introduce a closed-loop evolution process that alternates between learning to use the current skill bank and evolving the skill bank itself. Specifically, we train the controller with reinforcement learning (RL) using downstream task signals as feedback for skill selection. Periodically, a designer aggregates the hardest cases produced during training, selects representative failures, and uses an LLM to refine existing skills and propose new ones. After each evolution step, the controller continues training on the evolved skill bank, with additional exploration to facilitate adopting newly introduced skills. Overall, this process gradually strengthens both the skill selection policy and the evolving skill bank, moving toward a more adaptive memory management system driven by interaction data.

Experiments on LoCoMo, LongMemEval, HotpotQA, and ALFWorld show that MemSkill consistently improves task performance and generalizes well. Further analyses vali-

date key components and showcase representative evolved skills, offering insights toward more adaptive, self-evolving memory management for LLM agents.

Our contributions can be summarized as follows.

- • We propose MemSkill, an agent memory method that represents memory operations as an evolving skill bank, where each skill provides reusable guidance for selecting, extracting, and organizing useful memories. This turns memory construction from a fixed handcrafted pipeline into an adaptive skill-conditioned generation process.
- • We introduce a closed-loop optimization recipe that combines reinforcement learning for skill selection with LLM-guided skill evolution from hard cases, enabling continual refinement of the skill bank and taking a step toward self-evolving agent memory systems.
- • We evaluate MemSkill on LoCoMo, LongMemEval, HotpotQA, and ALFWorld, demonstrating consistent gains and strong transfer ability across conversational QA and embodied interaction settings, offering insights for self-evolving memory in LLM agents.

##### 2. Related Work

###### 2.1. LLM Agent Memory Systems

Prior work on agent memory focuses on constructing external memories from interaction histories and leveraging them

to support downstream reasoning and decision making. Typical pipelines periodically extract salient information into a memory store, retrieve relevant entries for a new query, and update the store via consolidation or pruning (Kang et al., 2025; Zhong et al., 2024; Xu et al., 2025; Packer et al., 2023; Chhikara et al., 2025; Fang et al., 2025). More recently, learning-based approaches such as Memory-R1 (Yan et al., 2025) and Mem-α (Wang et al., 2025a) optimize memory management with reinforcement learning using downstream task signals. Despite this progress, memory management is still largely governed by static, hand-crafted routines for extraction, consolidation, and pruning.

Several concurrent works also explore self-evolving memory in agent settings, but differ from our focus. EvoMemory (Wei et al., 2025) evaluates streaming memory evolution, MemEvolve (Zhang et al., 2025b) optimizes predefined memory architectures, MemGen (Zhang et al., 2025a) targets latent memory for reasoning, and ReasoningBank (Ouyang et al., 2025) distills reasoning strategies from experience. By contrast, we target the evolution of memory skills themselves, enabling the system to refine and grow reusable memory operations over time.

###### 2.2. Self-Evolving LLM Agents

Recent work on self-evolving LLM agents studies how agents can improve from interaction experience with minimal manual supervision. ExpeL (Zhao et al., 2024) distills trajectories into editable natural-language insights and retrieves relevant experiences to guide future decisions, while EvolveR (Wu et al., 2025) formalizes an experience lifecycle that consolidates interactions into reusable principles and closes the loop with reinforcement learning updates. A complementary line reduces reliance on curated data via self-play style curricula: Absolute Zero Reasoner (Zhao et al., 2025) trains a proposer and solver with verifiable rewards from a code executor, and Multi-Agent Evolve (Chen et al., 2025) extends this to a proposer solver judge triad with LLM-based evaluation; R-Zero (Huang et al., 2025) follows a similar challenger solver co-evolution pattern. Beyond curricula, systems such as AgentEvolver (Zhai et al., 2025) and RAGEN (Wang et al., 2025b) study efficient agent learning dynamics and stabilization in multi-turn RL settings, while ADAS (Hu et al., 2024) and AlphaEvolve (Novikov et al., 2025) explore automated discovery and evolutionary improvement of agent designs. Finally, SkillWeaver (Zheng et al., 2025) shows that agents can discover and refine reusable skills for web interaction. In contrast, our focus is on self-evolving memory skills that govern how agents construct and revise memories over time.

##### 3. Method

In this section, we first provide an overview of MemSkill (Section 3.1), then detail the skill bank (Section 3.2) and the three core components (controller (Section 3.3.1), executor (Section 3.3.2), and designer (Section 3.4)), and finally summarize the closed-loop optimization procedure that alternates between learning to use the current skills and evolving the skill bank from hard cases (Section 3.5).

###### 3.1. Overview

As shown in Figure 2, we propose MemSkill, which optimizes agent memory through two intertwined processes. First, it learns to use a given skill bank: a controller selects context-relevant skills, and an executor applies them to produce memory updates. Second, it improves the skill bank itself: a designer periodically revises existing skills and adds new ones based on challenging training cases.

To disentangle trace-specific memories from reusable memory management knowledge, MemSkill maintains two stores. The memory bank is trace-specific and stores memories for each training trace (e.g., a long dialogue). In contrast, the skill bank is shared across traces and contains reusable memory skills. During training, the controller and executor build each trace’s memory bank, while the designer updates the shared skill bank between phases. This alternating procedure gradually improves both the skill selection policy and the skill bank for memory construction.

###### 3.2. Skill Bank

As shown in Figure 2, a memory skill specifies a reusable memory operation as structured guidance, including when it is applicable and how it should be applied to the current context. Concretely, each skill s ∈ S contains (i) a short description for skill representation and selection, and (ii) a detailed content specification that instructs the executor on memory extraction or revision.

We start from a minimal set of general-purpose primitives to ensure a stable and functional initialization. Specifically, we initialize the skill bank with four basic skills corresponding to canonical memory operations: INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and SKIP. Starting from this minimal set, the designer progressively refines existing skills and expands the bank by proposing new skills that address uncovered failure modes. (Appendix C details skill description)

###### 3.3. Learning to Use Memory Skills

In this part, we describe how MemSkill learns to use memory skills, covering (i) the skill-selection policy and (ii) skill-conditioned memory construction.

Closed-loop Optimization

- Figure 2. MemSkill architecture overview. Given an interaction trace, MemSkill processes it span by span: the controller selects a Top-K subset of skills from a shared skill bank conditioned on the current text span and retrieved memories, and an LLM executor applies the selected skills in one pass to update the trace-specific memory bank. The constructed memory is then evaluated on memory-dependent training queries to provide task reward for optimizing the controller, while query-centric failures are logged into a sliding hard-case buffer. Periodically, the designer mines representative hard cases to refine existing skills and propose new ones, yielding alternating phases of skill usage and skill evolution. More skill case study can be found in Section 4.5 and Appendix C.
- 3.3.1. CONTROLLER: SKILL SELECTION POLICY

ory embedding, and is omitted when Mt is empty. Here, ui is the representation of skill si ∈ St, computed from its description as a compact and stable semantic signal rather than the full skill content. The embedding model e(·) is shared and fixed, while fθctx and fθskill are trainable neural networks in the controller for learnable skill selection.

To enable effective skill selection as the skill bank evolves, we introduce a controller that selects a small set of relevant memory skills for the current context. At each memory construction step, we update memory at the span level: we split each interaction trace (e.g., a dialogue) into fixedlength contiguous spans by token count and process them sequentially. For each span, the controller conditions its selection on (i) the current text span and (ii) the retrieved existing memories from the current trace’s memory bank (empty for initial span), rather than operating turn by turn.

Compatibility with an evolving skill bank. Instead of producing a fixed-dimensional action head tied to a fixed number of skills, the controller concatenates the state representation with each candidate skill representation and applies a shared scorer to all such state-skill pairs in parallel:

To remain compatible with a variable-size skill bank as it continuously evolves, the controller scores each skill by measuring the semantic distance between the current state and skill representations, supporting a changing skill set while staying sensitive to what is already stored in memory.

State and skill representations. Formally, let xt denote the current text span at step t, and let Mt = {mt,1,...,mt,R} be the retrieved memories from the current trace’s memory bank. We first encode xt and Mt with a fixed embedding model e(·), aggregate the retrieved memory embeddings by element-wise averaging, and concatenate it with the span embedding:

ht = fθctx([e(xt);m¯ t]), ui = fθskill(e(desc(si))),

(1) where m¯ t = R1 Rr=1 e(mt,r) denotes the aggregated mem-

zt,i = fθscore([ht;ui]), pθ(i | ht) = softmax(zt)i,

(2) where fθscore is a trainable neural network, and zt ∈ R|S

t|

adapts as the skill bank evolves.

Top-K skill selection. Given the categorical distribution pθ(i | ht) over the current skill bank St, the controller selects an ordered Top-K set of skills At = (at,1,...,at,K) (e.g., via Gumbel-Top-K (Kool et al., 2019)), and only passes the selected skills to the executor, keeping the skill context concise and relevant.

3.3.2. EXECUTOR: SKILL-CONDITIONED MEMORY EXTRACTION

Given the selected skills At, the fixed executor constructs memory updates by conditioning an LLM on (i) the current

text span xt, (ii) the retrieved memory items Mt, and (iii) the selected skills At. This mirrors skill-conditioned inference in agent systems, where a small set of relevant skills is provided to guide behavior for the current context. The executor produces structured memory updates, which are parsed and applied to the trace’s memory bank. By composing several skills for the same text span and extracting memory in one LLM call, MemSkill reduces repeated perturn processing and scales better to long interaction histories. Appendix D details the executor prompt.

- 3.3.3. CONTROLLER OPTIMIZATION

We train the controller with reinforcement learning, using downstream task performance as feedback for its skill selections. For each training trace, the controller makes a sequence of Top-K selections while the executor incrementally builds the trace-specific memory bank. After construction, we evaluate the resulting memory bank on the trace’s memory-dependent training queries and use the resulting task performance as the reward (e.g., F1 or success rate).

A key technical detail is that the controller’s action is an ordered Top-K list selected without replacement, rather than a single discrete action. We therefore compute the joint logprobability log πθ(At | ht) under this selection process and use it in standard policy-gradient objectives (Schulman et al., 2017) via importance weighting and clipping. Concretely, for At = (at,1,...,at,K), the joint probability is

πθ(At | ht) =

K

j=1

pθ(at,j | ht) 1 − ℓ<j pθ(at,ℓ | ht)

, (3)

which reduces to the single-action case when K = 1. Appendix B.4 gives implementation details.

- 3.4. Skill Evolution through Designer Feedback

Beyond learning to select from a fixed set of skills, MemSkill evolves the skill bank using an LLM-based designer (fixed) that operates periodically during training.

Hard-case buffer. During controller training, we maintain a sliding-window buffer of challenging cases observed recently. Each case is query-centric, recording the query along with its ground-truth and metadata (e.g., retrieved memories and model prediction), as well as summary statistics such as task performance and the number of failures observed so far. The buffer uses two expiration rules: cases are removed if they become too old (exceeding a maximum training step gap) or if the buffer reaches its capacity limit, which tracks recent failure patterns without growing unbounded.

Selecting representative hard cases. To focus designer updates on impactful failures, we cluster cases (e.g., KMeans) into groups that naturally reflect different query or error types. Within each cluster, we prioritize representative cases

using a difficulty score that increases when task performance is low and when the same case fails repeatedly. This produces a compact set of high-value cases for skill evolution while preserving diversity across error types.

Two-stage skill evolution. The designer updates the skill bank in two stages. First, it employs an LLM to analyze the selected hard cases and identify what memory behaviors are missing or mis-specified. Second, it uses the resulting analysis to propose concrete edits to existing skills and to introduce new skills. We keep the designer description concise and provide prompts in Appendix D.

Notably, we maintain snapshots of the best-performing skill bank and roll back if an update degrades performance, with early stopping when repeated designer updates fail to improve the training signal. After each evolution step, we also briefly increase exploration by biasing selection toward newly introduced skills, encouraging the controller to try them and facilitating efficient learning of their utility. Due to page limit, more details about the designer can be found in Appendix B.2.

###### 3.5. Closed-Loop Optimization

MemSkill alternates between (i) learning to select and apply skills to build memory banks and (ii) evolving the skill bank from hard cases mined during training. Each cycle begins with controller training on the current skill bank, where the executor constructs memories and accumulates challenging cases. The designer then updates the skill bank using representative hard cases, optionally rolling back to a prior snapshot if performance regresses. The next cycle resumes controller training on the updated skill bank, with additional exploration to encourage early use of new skills. Over cycles, this closed loop gradually improves how skills are selected, applied, and refined for memory construction.

##### 4. Experiments 4.1. Experiment Setup

Datasets and Baselines. We evaluate MemSkill on four benchmarks: LoCoMo (Maharana et al., 2024), LongMemEval (Wu et al., 2024), HotpotQA (Yang et al., 2018), and ALFWorld (Shridhar et al., 2020), where HotpotQA is used in Section 4.3 to study skill transfer under distribution shift. The remaining three benchmarks cover two representative settings. (i) Conversational Benchmarks include LoCoMo and LongMemEval, which evaluate memory construction from long, dialogue-style interaction histories. For these datasets, we report F1-score (F1) and an LLMbased judge score (L-J). (ii) Embodied Interactive Tasks are evaluated on ALFWorld with two standard subsets, ALFSeen and ALF-Unseen, and we report success rate (SR) and the number of environment interaction steps (#Stps).

Appendix B.1 provides dataset splits.

We compare MemSkill against several strong baselines: (1) No-Memory, which answers directly without an external memory; (2) CoN (Yu et al., 2024); (3) ReadAgent (Lee et al., 2024); (4) MemoryBank (Zhong et al., 2024); (5) A-MEM (Xu et al., 2025); (6) Mem0 (Chhikara et al., 2025); (7) LangMem (LangChain, 2025); and (8) MemoryOS (Kang et al., 2025). Overall, this setup spans diverse benchmarks and baselines, enabling a broad and consistent comparison across diverse settings.

Implementation Details. We instantiate fθctx, fθskill, and fθscore as independent lightweight multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), and use LLaMA-3.3-70B-Instruct (Grattafiori et al.,

- 2024) and Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Instruct (Yang et al.,
- 2025) as the base LLMs, accessed through an API service. Unless otherwise specified, we train MemSkill on LLaMA and use Qwen only for transfer experiments. LongMemEval is also evaluated in a transfer setting, where we directly apply the skills learned on LoCoMo without further training.

During training, we optimize the controller with PPO (Schulman et al., 2017). MemSkill constructs memory at the span level; on conversational benchmarks, each dialogue session is a processing unit, and the controller selects K=3

skills per unit. We instantiate e(·) with Qwen3-Embedding0.6B (Yang et al., 2025), also used as the memory retriever, and retrieve up to 20 memory items for MemSkill and all baselines for consistency. For the designer, skill evolution is triggered every 100 training steps, with at most 3 skill edits per evolution round. For ALFWorld, we cap environment interactions at 50 steps.

At evaluation time, we keep the same span-level formulation and set the span/chunk size to 512 by default, while keeping the overall procedure unchanged. Unless otherwise specified, we use K=7 skills for LoCoMo and LongMemEval at evaluation time, and K=5 for ALFWorld.

Figure 3. Skill generalization under distribution shift on HotpotQA. We transfer the LoCoMo-trained skill bank to HotpotQA and evaluate three context-length settings (50/100/200 concatenated documents) following (Yu et al., 2025). Bars show LLM-judge (L-J) under LLaMA with different Top-K skill counts, compared to MemoryOS and A-MEM.

model block, indicating higher-quality constructed memories. In comparison, prior methods such as MemoryBank, A-MEM, and MemoryOS use fixed, manually specified memory procedures for extraction and revision, whereas MemSkill learns and evolves its skills from interaction, enabling better adaptation across contexts. On ALFWorld, MemSkill achieves the highest success rates on both seen and unseen splits, indicating that skill-guided memory construction can benefit interactive decision making, whereas other baselines are less reliable at leveraging memory to support long-horizon action execution. Overall, the results show that MemSkill is effective across diverse settings.

settings with increasing difficulty, corresponding to different numbers of concatenated documents (i.e., 50/100/200). All results in this section use LLaMA as the base model and report the LLM-judge score (L-J). For baselines, we include MemoryOS and A-MEM, the most competitive methods on conversational benchmarks in Table 1, and omit weaker alternatives for clarity.

Figure 3 shows that MemSkill transfers strongly to HotpotQA across all three context sizes. MemSkill consistently outperforms strong baselines such as MemoryOS and AMEM, with gains becoming more pronounced in the challenging long-context setting. These results suggest that the learned memory skills are not tied to dialogue-specific surface forms, but capture reusable extraction and revision behaviors that remain effective as input structure and retrieval demands change.

Generalization across base models. A key advantage of MemSkill is strong generalization across base models. We train MemSkill only with LLaMA and directly transfer the learned skills to Qwen without retraining. Despite this strict transfer setting, MemSkill remains competitive and outperforms strong baselines on both conversational and embodied evaluations, showing that the evolved skills capture reusable memory behaviors that can be instantiated by different underlying LLMs.

The same plots also reveal mild sensitivity to the number of selected skills K. Increasing K generally improves performance, with K=7 achieving the best results across all three settings, while smaller K can under-utilize the skill bank under longer contexts. Overall, the trend indicates that MemSkill benefits from composing multiple skills when the context becomes longer and noisier, while still maintaining strong transfer without any HotpotQA-specific training.

Cross-dataset transfer. MemSkill also generalizes across datasets within the same broad setting. In particular, LongMemEval is evaluated purely by transferring the skill bank learned on LoCoMo, yet MemSkill achieves the best results among all methods, suggesting that the learned skills are not overfit to a single benchmark. Section 4.3 studies transfer under more pronounced distribution shifts.

###### 4.4. Ablation Study

We perform ablations to disentangle the contributions of (i) learning to select skills and (ii) evolving the skill bank. Table 2 reports LLM Judge (L-J) results on LoCoMo under both base models (LLaMA and Qwen). As shown, w/o controller (w/o Ctrl) replaces the learned controller with random skill selection while keeping the rest of the pipeline unchanged. w/o designer (w/o Des) disables the designer and fixes the skill bank to the four initial primitives. Refineonly (Ref.-only) allows the designer to refine existing skills but prohibits adding new ones.

###### 4.3. Skill Generalization Under Distribution Shift

Beyond transfer within dialogue-style memory benchmarks, we evaluate whether learned skills generalize under a distribution shift in interaction format and evidence structure. Concretely, we directly apply the skill bank trained on LoCoMo to HotpotQA, where inputs are long-form, documentstyle narratives rather than multi-turn dialogues. Following the protocol in (Yu et al., 2025), we test three context-length

###### Capture Temporal Context

###### Capture Action Constraints

Purpose: Capture detailed constraints on actions, including object states and movements, necessary for task completion.

Purpose: Capture the temporal context of events, activities, or facts mentioned in the text chunk, including any relevant dates, times, durations, or sequential information. When to use: The text chunk mentions a specific event, activity, or fact with associated temporal information. How to apply: Identify the key temporal elements (e.g., start time, end time, duration, sequence). Capture the temporal context in a concise and specific format, considering any sequential relationships. Constraints: Focus on explicit temporal information mentioned in the text chunk. Avoid inferring temporal details not directly stated.

When to use: The input mentions constraints on actions, including object states and movements, which are crucial for future task steps.

How to apply: Identify the action, its constraints, and relevant object states and movements from the input. Create a new memory item with the action-constraint pair, including object states and movements.

Constraints: Only capture constraints on actions relevant to the task. Update existing constraint memories if new information is provided.

###### Capture Activity Details

###### Track Object Location

Purpose: Explicitly track the location and state of an object necessary for task completion.

Purpose: Capture detailed information about activities mentioned in the text chunk, including the type of activity, location, participants, temporal details, and any relevant contextual information. When to use: The text chunk mentions a specific activity or event with contextual details. How to apply: Identify the key elements of the activity (e.g., type, location, participants, temporal details). Capture any relevant contextual information that provides additional insight into the activity. Keep the activity details specific, actionable, and concise. Constraints: Focus on explicit activity details and contextual info. Avoid inferring activity details or context not directly stated.

When to use: The text chunk mentions an object's location or state. The object's location or state is crucial for future task steps.

How to apply: Identify the object, its location, and relevant state from the text chunk. Create a new memory item with the object-location-state triplet.

Constraints: Only track locations and states of objects relevant to the task. Update existing location memories if new information is provided.

sistently degrades performance, confirming that MemSkill benefits from both targeted skill selection and skill evolution. In particular, random skill selection leads to a clear drop from the default setting, highlighting the importance of learning to choose relevant skills rather than providing arbitrary ones. Disabling the designer yields an even larger degradation, especially under Qwen, suggesting that evolving the skill bank is important for learning reusable memory behaviors that generalize beyond a fixed, manually specified operation set. Finally, refinement-only consistently outperforms static skills on both LLaMA and Qwen, with a particularly large gain under Qwen, yet remains below the default setting, indicating that introducing new skills yields additional benefits beyond refining the initial primitives.

###### 4.5. Discussion

Case study. To make MemSkill more interpretable, we inspect the final evolved skill bank and report representative skills from LoCoMo and ALFWorld. As shown in Figure 4, the learned skills show clear domain specialization. LoCoMo skills emphasize temporal context and activity details, suggesting that dialogue memory benefits from lightweight event structure. In contrast, ALFWorld skills focus on ac-

tion constraints and object locations, showing that embodied tasks require actionable world-state memories for multi-step execution. Overall, the evolved skill bank reflects recurring information needs from the data, rather than a fixed notion of what to remember.

Together, these skills show that MemSkill distills and refines reusable memory behaviors from interaction data, reducing reliance on hand-crafted memory designs. Appendix C gives more examples.

Cost analysis. We conduct a runtime cost analysis on LoCoMo using LLaMA, additionally including LightMem (Fang et al., 2025) as a baseline. We report L-J, input/output tokens, and LLM calls, accounting for all inference-time LLM calls from memory extraction and query answering, excluding LLM-judge calls used only for evaluation. Since MemSkill learns and evolves the skill bank before deployment, this preparation cost is amortized over repeated use, with further evolution triggered only occasionally. We therefore focus on runtime cost as the practical efficiency measure. At inference time, MemSkill constructs memory at the span level rather than turn by turn, substantially reducing LLM calls. To show this trade-off, we vary the span size (SS) and report the quality-cost frontier in Table 3.

MemSkill achieves a stronger quality-cost trade-off than prior baselines. With moderate span sizes, it obtains higher L-J scores while using fewer input/output tokens and LLM calls. In particular, Span Size=512 offers the best overall balance, achieving the highest quality with much lower runtime cost than MemoryOS, A-MEM, and LightMem. This suggests span-level construction reduces redundant

LLM calls without sacrificing memory quality. Larger span sizes reduce cost, but may hurt performance because each memory update covers a longer span. This makes span size a knob for adapting MemSkill to different efficiency requirements.

##### 5. Conclusion

We present MemSkill, an agent memory method that reframes memory operations as an evolving skill bank. MemSkill learns to select relevant skills for each context span and conditions an LLM executor on them to construct skillguided memories. Beyond learning to use a fixed skill set, MemSkill introduces a designer that improves the skill bank by refining existing skills and proposing new ones from challenging cases, forming a closed-loop training procedure. Experiments on LoCoMo, LongMemEval, HotpotQA, and ALFWorld show consistent improvements over strong baselines, while qualitative analyses illustrate how evolving skills enable more adaptive memory management. We hope MemSkill encourages future work on self-improving agent memory systems that learn not only to use memory, but also to continually improve how memory is constructed and maintained.

##### A. More Experimental Results

###### A.1. More Comparison Experiments

We further compare MemSkill with additional baselines on ALFWorld, including LightMem (Fang et al., 2025), AWM (Wang et al., 2024), and Expel (Zhao et al., 2024). As shown in Table 4, MemSkill consistently achieves the best performance across both base models and evaluation splits. With LLaMA, MemSkill obtains an average success rate of 80.36, outperforming the strongest baseline LightMem by 5.53 points. The gain is especially clear on ALF-Unseen, where MemSkill improves the success rate from 75.37 to 83.58 while reducing the average number of steps from 20.69 to 16.63.

The advantage remains under transfer evaluation with Qwen, where MemSkill is not trained using this base model or dataset. MemSkill achieves an average success rate of 81.29, surpassing the strongest baseline Expel by 7.61 points. It also requires fewer interaction steps on both ALF-Seen and ALF-Unseen. These results suggest that the learned memory skills can capture reusable experience patterns for embodied decision-making, leading to both higher task success and more efficient execution across seen and unseen environments.

Table 5 further reports ALFWorld results without in-context demonstrations. This setting is complementary to the main-table evaluation with demonstrations, but is more controlled for studying memory itself. Since in-context demonstrations can also act as an external form of memory, including them may confound the gains brought by each method’s constructed memory. Therefore, this setting decouples demonstrations from memory construction and isolates the contribution of the learned memory mechanism.

Under this stricter setting, MemSkill still consistently outperforms all baselines across both base models and both evaluation splits. With LLaMA, MemSkill achieves an average success rate of 57.71, outperforming the strongest baseline LightMem by 11.72 points. The improvement is larger on ALF-Unseen, where MemSkill improves the success rate from 46.27 to 59.70, suggesting stronger generalization to unseen environments. MemSkill also requires fewer interaction steps than all baselines, reducing the average steps on ALF-Seen and ALF-Unseen to 26.87 and 25.88, respectively.

The same trend holds in the transfer setting with Qwen, where MemSkill is not trained using this base model or dataset. MemSkill achieves an average success rate of 63.83, improving over the strongest baseline by 8.03 points. It also obtains the lowest number of steps on both ALF-Seen and ALF-Unseen. These results show that the gains of MemSkill do not rely on in-context demonstrations, and that the learned memory skills provide reusable task experience that improves both success rate and execution efficiency.

###### A.2. More Results on Appworld

To further evaluate whether memory skills generalize beyond conversational and embodied household settings, we extend our study to AppWorld (Trivedi et al., 2024), a more challenging interactive tool-use benchmark. We report results on both Test-Normal (Test-N) and Test-Challenge (Test-C), using Pass Rate (PR) and the average number of execution steps as evaluation metrics. Our default setting follows the stronger evaluation protocol with in-context demonstrations. In addition,

we also report a controlled variant without demonstrations, which helps isolate the contribution of each method’s constructed memory from the task guidance provided by demonstrations.

As shown in Table 6, MemSkill achieves the best average PR across both base models under the default demonstration-based setting. With LLaMA, the No-Memory baseline already performs strongly, indicating that in-context demonstrations provide substantial task-specific guidance and make this setting partially saturated. As a result, the performance gaps among different memory methods become relatively small. Nevertheless, MemSkill still achieves the best overall pass rate and uses the fewest execution steps across both splits, suggesting that the learned memory skills can still improve efficiency even when demonstrations already provide strong external guidance.

The benefit of MemSkill is more evident with Qwen, where the demonstration-based setting leaves more room for memorybased improvement. In this case, MemSkill consistently outperforms prior memory methods and also improves over the No-Memory baseline. It further achieves the lowest execution steps on both Test-N and Test-C, indicating that MemSkill can effectively complement in-context demonstrations and support more efficient tool-use behavior.

The controlled setting without in-context demonstrations further confirms the independent contribution of learned memory skills. In this setting, MemSkill achieves the best average PR under both base models, with consistent gains on both Test-N and Test-C. This shows that MemSkill is not merely benefiting from demonstrations, but can provide useful experience abstraction when the agent must rely more directly on constructed memory.

Overall, these results show that MemSkill generalizes to interactive tool-use environments beyond conversational and embodied household tasks. Under the default demonstration-based setting, MemSkill remains competitive even when demonstrations provide strong task guidance, and brings clearer gains when the base model leaves more room for memorybased improvement. Under the controlled no-demonstration setting, MemSkill consistently improves pass rate over prior memory methods, further supporting the effectiveness of skill-conditioned memory construction for complex multi-step tool use.

###### A.3. Experimental Results on Small Models

We further evaluate MemSkill with Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct to examine whether the learned memory skills remain effective when the base model has more limited capacity. As shown in Table 7, MemSkill consistently achieves the best performance across both LoCoMo and LongMemEval. Compared with prior memory methods, MemSkill improves both F1 and L-J on the two conversational benchmarks, indicating that skill-conditioned memory construction can provide useful support even for smaller backbone models.

The improvement is also maintained on LongMemEval, where no training is performed using this base model or dataset. This suggests that the learned memory skills are not tightly coupled to a specific backbone, and can transfer to smaller models under long-context conversational settings. Overall, these results show that MemSkill does not rely solely on the capability of a large base model. Instead, its learned memory skills provide complementary gains that remain effective under a more resource-efficient model setting.

###### A.4. Training Stability

MemSkill incorporates several mechanisms to improve the stability of skill learning and evolution. First, we maintain a snapshot of the skill bank after each evolution round. If the updated skill bank underperforms the best-performing snapshot observed so far, we roll back to the best snapshot and continue subsequent evolution from it. This prevents occasional harmful skill updates from permanently degrading the memory system.

Second, hard cases are selected according to difficulty scores, so the designer is guided by recurring failure patterns rather than noisy random examples. This encourages each evolution round to focus on systematic weaknesses of the current skill bank. Third, skill evolution is performed at controlled intervals, with a capped number of skill modifications in each round. This avoids abrupt changes to the skill bank and makes the learning process more gradual.

Together, these mechanisms make the evolution process less sensitive to noisy feedback and reduce the risk of unstable skill drift. In practice, we observe that the learned skill bank improves progressively over evolution rounds, suggesting that the snapshot rollback, hard-case selection, and controlled update strategy provide a stable basis for self-evolving memory skills.

##### B. More Implementation Details

###### B.1. Evaluation Details

LLM judge and infrastructure. We use openai/gpt-oss-120b as the LLM judge (judge prompts can be found in Appendix D). All API-based models are accessed through the NV NIM API1 and Together API2. Training is conducted on NVIDIA A6000 GPUs.

LoCoMo (Maharana et al., 2024). LoCoMo contains 10 long interaction samples, each paired with roughly 200 training queries on average. We split the dataset by sample into train, validation, and test sets with a 6/2/2 ratio. We further remove adversarial queries, since their supporting evidence is absent from the provided context and may introduce noisy supervision during training.

LongMemEval (Wu et al., 2024). We use the LongMemEval-S split, where each example contains an ultra-long conversation of roughly 100K tokens. We remove abstention questions, since they do not require retrieving or constructing useful memory from the conversation history. We split the remaining data into train, validation, and test sets. Although the training split is not used for learning in this transfer setting, the validation split is used to tune dataset-specific configurations. We then conduct transfer evaluation on a stratified test sample of about one-fifth of the dataset, approximately 100 samples, ensuring coverage of different question types for a comprehensive assessment.

ALFWorld (Shridhar et al., 2020). We first collect expert trajectories from the training split and use them as the corpus for memory or experience construction. We then evaluate on the official ALF-Seen and ALF-Unseen splits. More training configuration details can be found in Appendix B.3.

HotpotQA (Yang et al., 2018). We use HotpotQA to study transfer under distribution shift, following the evaluation protocol of (Yu et al., 2025). Specifically, we evaluate on three context-length settings with increasing difficulty, corresponding to 50, 100, and 200 concatenated documents, denoted as eval 50, eval 100, and eval 200. Unless otherwise specified, all results in this part use LLaMA as the base model and report the LLM-judge score (L-J).

Span-level evaluation. During evaluation, we construct memory at the span level with a default span size of 512 tokens, rather than updating memory turn by turn. This substantially reduces the number of LLM calls and improves evaluation efficiency.

###### B.2. More Details of the Designer

Hard-case buffer and representative case mining. The designer maintains a sliding hard-case buffer that tracks recently challenging evaluation cases without growing unbounded. Each case stores the query, the retrieved memories used to answer

- 1https://docs.nvidia.com/nim/
- 2https://docs.together.ai/

it, the model prediction, the reference answer, the resulting task reward (e.g., F1), and a failure counter that records how many times the case has been answered incorrectly. To prioritize cases that are both low-reward and repeatedly failed, we assign each case a difficulty score

###### d(q) = 1 − r(q) · c(q), (4)

where r(q) ∈ [0,1] is the task reward for query q and c(q) is its cumulative failure count within the buffer window. Higher d(q) indicates more critical cases that should be examined first.

To encourage coverage over diverse failure types, we further cluster hard cases by semantic similarity of their queries and mine representative cases from each cluster. For example, in LoCoMo, some queries focus on temporal cues (e.g., when an event happened) while others emphasize locations (e.g., where something occurred). Clustering helps separate these semantic types so the designer feedback is not dominated by a single frequent error mode, improving diversity and completeness of the mined supervision.

Exploration incentive for newly introduced skills. After each evolution round, the designer may introduce new skills that the controller has not yet learned to utilize. To facilitate adoption, we apply a short post-update exploration phase by biasing the controller toward new skills directly at the logit level. Let Snew ⊆ St denote the newly added skills, and let pθ(i | ht) = softmax(zt)i be the controller distribution at step t. We encourage the total probability mass assigned to new skills to reach a target threshold τq:

pθ(i | ht) ≥ τq, τq ∈ [0,1]. (5)

i∈Snew

When the constraint in Eq. (5) is violated, we add a uniform logit gain δq to all new skills,

zt,i′ =

zt,i + δq, i ∈ Snew, zt,i, otherwise,

p′θ(· | ht) = softmax(zt′), (6)

p′θ(i | ht) ≥ τq. By operating on logits, this mechanism preserves the controller architecture and provides a smooth probability-level encouragement toward new skills. We apply this incentive for the first Texplore=50 training steps after each evolution round. To avoid persistent bias, the target threshold decays linearly within this window:

where δq is chosen as the minimal value that makes i∈S

new

q Texplore

τq = τ0 · 1 −

###### , q = 0,1,...,Texplore − 1, (7)

with default τ0=0.3. This schedule provides strong initial exploration and then gradually fades, yielding a smooth transition back to the controller’s learned selection behavior.

Early stopping and rollback based on stabilized rewards. MemSkill performs skill evolution periodically, where each evolution cycle consists of a fixed number of controller-training steps (e.g., 100 steps) on the current skill bank. Because the reward signal can be volatile immediately after a skill-bank update, we assess whether a cycle improves performance using a stabilized reward estimate: we compute the average task reward over the last quarter of training steps within the cycle, and treat this value as the cycle’s score.

Let L denote the number of controller-training steps per cycle and {rt}Lt=1 the step-level rewards within the cycle. We define the cycle score as

L

1 L/4

rt. (8)

r¯tail =

t=3L/4+1

We compare r¯tail against the best score observed so far. If the current cycle does not improve this criterion, then before performing the next skill evolution step, we roll back the skill bank to the previously best-performing snapshot and restart evolution from that snapshot. This rollback prevents compounding degradations from suboptimal designer updates.

Finally, if the stabilized reward fails to improve for several consecutive evolution cycles (we use a fixed patience), we early stop training and return the best skill bank snapshot encountered during training.

###### B.3. Details on ALFWorld Training

ALFWorld differs from the other benchmarks in that it is an interactive environment rather than a static text corpus. To instantiate MemSkill in this setting, we first convert ALFWorld into an offline training protocol by collecting expert trajectories on the training split. Each trajectory records the agent’s interaction sequence (observations, actions, and outcomes) and serves as an interaction trace for memory construction.

Task-type grouping. ALFWorld tasks naturally fall into a small number of recurring goal templates. Following common practice, we group trajectories by task type (i.e., goal template), such as PICK & PLACE (put an object into/on a target receptacle), CLEAN & PLACE (clean an object and then place it), HEAT & PLACE (heat an object and then place it), and COOL & PLACE (cool an object and then place it).3

Experience corpus vs. evaluation cases. To fit ALFWorld into our training framework, we construct per-type train-time data splits from the offline expert trajectories. For each task type, we randomly sample a subset of trajectories as the experience corpus used for memory construction, and sample another non-overlapping subset of trajectories from the same type as evaluation cases. During training, MemSkill builds a trajectory-specific memory bank from the experience corpus (span by span, via controller and executor), and then evaluates the constructed memory on the evaluation cases to obtain task reward and to log failure cases.

Motivation. Using non-overlapping trajectories from the same task type for experience construction and evaluation provides a controlled generalization signal: trajectories within a type share goal structure and recurrent interaction patterns, making memories and skills more transferable across different instances of the same template. This setup encourages MemSkill to learn reusable memory skills that capture type-level regularities (e.g., relevant object states and action prerequisites) rather than overfitting to a single trajectory, while still ensuring that evaluation traces are held out from the traces used to build memory.

###### B.4. Details on Training Objectives

This part details the reinforcement learning objective used to optimize the controller in MemSkill when each decision selects an ordered Top-K set of skills without replacement.

Episode, states, and Top-K actions. Training iterates over interaction traces (episodes). For a trace, MemSkill processes spans sequentially. At step t, the controller observes the raw state st ≜ (xt,Mt), represented by the learned state embedding ht defined in Section 3.3.1. Let St = {1,...,Nt} denote the current skill bank, whose size Nt may change as the designer evolves skills. The controller computes logits zt ∈ RN

t by applying the shared scorer to all state-skill pairs, and induces pθ(i | ht) = softmax(zt)i. (9)

Instead of sampling a single skill, the controller selects an ordered Top-K set At = (at,1,...,at,K) without replacement, implemented via Gumbel-Top-K sampling (Kool et al., 2019) (i.e., adding i.i.d. Gumbel noise to logits and taking the top-K indices).

Joint probability of Top-K without-replacement selection. For PPO-style policy optimization, we need the joint probability of sampling the ordered set At under the without-replacement process. This probability can be written as

K

πθ(At | ht) =

j=1

with the corresponding joint log-probability

pθ(at,j | ht) 1 − ℓ<j pθ(at,ℓ | ht)

, (10)

K

log πθ(At | ht) =

j=1

log pθ(at,j | ht) − log 1 −

When K = 1, Eq. 10 reduces to the standard single-action case.

3We use the task template provided by the environment to define task types.

pθ(at,ℓ | ht) . (11)

ℓ<j

Rewards from memory-dependent evaluation. For each trace, after processing all spans and constructing the tracespecific memory bank, we evaluate the memory bank on the trace’s memory-dependent training queries and obtain a scalar task score (e.g., F1 or success rate). We treat this score as the episode-level reward:

R ≜ Eval(memory bank;training queries) ∈ R. (12)

This reward is then assigned to the sequence of controller decisions within the trace. Concretely, we use standard return computation with discount factor γ:

T

γτ−trτ, (13)

Gt =

τ=t

where rτ is the per-step reward. In our default setting, reward is provided only after memory construction completes, i.e., rT = R and rτ = 0 for τ < T, so Gt = γT−tR. We learn a value function Vϕ(ht) and compute advantages Aˆt using generalized advantage estimation (GAE).

PPO objective with Top-K actions. We optimize the controller using proximal policy optimization (PPO) (Schulman et al., 2017), replacing the standard single-action log-probability with the Top-K joint log-probability in Eq. 11. Let θold denote the parameters of the behavior policy used to collect rollouts. For simplicity, we use ht to denote the state representation computed under the policy being evaluated. Define the importance ratio:

πθ(At | ht) πθ

= exp log πθ(At | ht) − log πθ

rt(θ) =

old

(At | ht)

old

###### (At | ht) . (14)

The clipped surrogate policy objective is

###### Lpolicy(θ) = Et min rt(θ)Aˆt, clip(rt(θ),1 − ϵ,1 + ϵ)Aˆt . (15)

We additionally optimize a value function and include an entropy bonus for exploration:

Lvalue(ϕ) = Et Vϕ(ht) − Gt 2 , (16) H(θ) = Et H(pθ(· | ht)) , (17)

where H(·) is the entropy of the categorical distribution over all skills. The overall objective (to maximize) is

Lpolicy(θ) − cv Lvalue(ϕ) + cH H(θ). (18)

max

θ,ϕ

In implementation, we minimize the negative of Eq. 18.

Gumbel-Top-K exploration. To sample Top-K skills without replacement during rollout collection, we use Gumbel-TopK sampling: at each step we draw i.i.d. Gumbel noise {gi}N

i=1, form perturbed logits z˜t,i = zt,i + gi, and take the indices of the K largest z˜t,i to obtain At. This provides stochastic exploration over skill subsets while remaining compatible with PPO through the joint probability in Eq. 10. For training stability, entropy regularization is computed from the base categorical distribution pθ(· | ht) over all skills (Eq. 17), which encourages exploration of the evolving skill bank even though the executed action is a Top-K set.

- - Read the context carefully and identify relevant information
- - If the answer can be found in the context, provide a short, precise answer
- - Output your answer within <answer></answer>tags <answer>your answer here</answer>

ALFWorld Env Interaction Prompt

You are controlling a text-based ALFWorld environment. Your job: choose the NEXT action as ONE text command. Output ONLY the command string, with no extra text. You MUST choose an action from the admissible actions list and copy it EXACTLY.

Goal: {goal} Retrieved procedural tips (optional, short & actionable): {retrieved memory} Interaction history so far (most recent info matters most): {history} Admissible actions (choose exactly ONE and copy it verbatim): {actions}

Now output exactly one line: the chosen action (must match one item above).

Executor Prompt

You are a memory management executor. Apply the selected skills to the input text chunk and retrieved memories, then output memory actions.

Input Text Chunk: {session text} Retrieved Memories (0-based index): {mem text} Selected Skills: {skills text}

Guidelines:

- - Apply any skill as needed; a skill may be used multiple times.
- - Read the input text chunk carefully line by line and apply any skill as needed.
- - Only use action types supported by the selected skills.
- - MEMORY INDEX is 0-based and must reference the retrieved memories list.

- - Output only action blocks in the format below.
- - Do not include explanations or REASONING lines. Output format (repeat as needed). Use ONE block per action and separate blocks with a blank line:

INSERT block: ACTION: INSERT MEMORY ITEM: [concise but complete summary with essential details]

UPDATE block: ACTION: UPDATE MEMORY INDEX: [0-based index] UPDATED MEMORY: [concise but complete merged summary with essential updates]

DELETE block: ACTION: DELETE MEMORY INDEX: [0-based index]

Designer Analysis Prompt

You are an expert analyst for a memory-augmented QA system. Analyze the failure cases below to identify why the system failed and how the memory management skills should change.

## How This System Works

- 1. **Memory Storage**: The system applies memory management skills to decide what information to store from the text chunk.
- 2. **Memory Retrieval**: At question time, it retrieves the most relevant memories by semantic similarity.
- 3. **Answer Generation**: An LLM answers using the retrieved memories. Failures can occur at any stage:

- - **Storage failure**: Important information was never stored (skill missing or misapplied)
- - **Retrieval failure**: Relevant memory exists but was not retrieved (embedding mismatch)
- - **Memory quality failure**: Memory exists but is too vague or incomplete to answer

## Current Memory Management Skills {operation bank description}

## Operation Evolution Feedback {evolution feedback}

## Failure Cases ({num failure cases} cases) {failure cases details}

## Analysis Instructions This is round 1 of a reflection loop. Produce a strong initial analysis that can be critiqued and improved.

- 1. For each case, check whether the retrieved memories contain the answer or the needed evidence.
- 2. If missing, decide whether it was never stored (storage failure) or stored but too weak (memory quality failure).
- 3. If the answer is present but not retrieved, label it retrieval failure and avoid changing skills unless the pattern repeats.
- 4. Group cases into patterns tied to information types, entities, temporal details, or constraints.
- 5. For each pattern, propose a concrete skill change: add a new skill or refine an existing one to capture missing details.
- 6. Provide up to {max changes} recommendations total (use fewer if only one change is justified).

## Output Format Provide your analysis as JSON:

{ “failure patterns”: [ { “pattern name”: “[descriptive name for this failure pattern]”, “affected cases”: [list of case numbers, e.g., 1, 3, 5], “root cause”: “[storage failure—retrieval failure—memory quality failure]”, “explanation”: “[why this pattern of failures is occurring]”, “potential fix”: “[what kind of operation change could address this]” } ], “recommendations”: [ { “action”: “[add new operation—refine existing operation—no change]”, “target operation”: “[operation name to refine, or null if adding new]”, “rationale”: “[clear explanation of why this is the best improvement]”, “priority”: “[high—medium—low]” } ], “summary”: “[1-2 sentence summary of main findings]” }

Focus on actionable insights. What specific change to the skill bank would prevent these failures? Output ONLY the JSON, no other text.

Based on the failure analysis, propose a specific improvement to the memory operation bank. ## Failure Analysis (from Stage 1) {analysis feedback} ## Current Operation Bank {operation bank full} {evolution feedback} ## Your Task Propose up to {max changes} improvements based on the analysis:

- **Option A - Add New Operation**: Create a new operation if the analysis shows a capability gap (e.g., certain information types are not being captured).
- **Option B - Refine Existing Operation**: Improve an existing operation’s instruction template if the analysis shows it’s not working well (e.g., memories are too vague, missing key details).
- **Option C - No Change**: If the failures are due to retrieval issues (not operation issues), or if the current operations are already well-designed. ## CRITICAL Requirements

- 1. instruction template MUST be a skill-style guide and MUST NOT include context placeholders (the executor injects the text chunk and retrieved memories)

- 2. instruction template MUST clearly state purpose, when to use, and constraints

- 3. instruction template MUST specify the allowed action type (INSERT or UPDATE only)

- 4. For new operations, ‘update type‘ must be either “insert” or “update” (delete and noop operations are not evolved at this time)

- 5. Only propose operations with update type “insert” or “update”

- 6. Avoid labels like “ENHANCED”, “ADVANCED”, or other marketing adjectives in descriptions or templates; keep phrasing neutral and task-specific
- 7. Do NOT embed output blocks; the executor handles output formatting and can apply the skill multiple times
- 8. The number of changes in the list MUST be less than max changes

- 9. Do NOT modify the same operation more than once in a single response, and do NOT refine an operation you add in the same response

## Example of a Well-Designed Insert Operation

{ “name”: “extract personal preferences”, “description”: “Memory management skill for capturing personal preferences and habits mentioned in the text chunk.”, “update type”: “insert”, “instruction template”: “Skill: Insert Preferences. Purpose: Capture personal preferences, habits, or opinions stated in the text chunk. When to use: The text chunk mentions likes, dislikes, routines, or goals tied to a person. How to apply: Attribute the preference to the correct person. Keep the preference specific and actionable. Constraints: Avoid one-off or ambiguous statements. Action type: INSERT only.” }

## Output Format Respond with ONE of these JSON structures: ### One or more changes (up to max changes): { “action”: “apply changes”, “summary”: “[overall rationale for the set of changes]”, “changes”: [ { “action”: “add new”, “new operation”: { “name”: “[snake case name]”, “description”: “[what it does and when to use it]”, “instruction template”: “[skill-style instruction template]”, “update type”: “[insert—update]”, “reasoning”: “[how this addresses the identified failures]” } }, { “action”: “refine existing”, “refined operation”: { “name”: “[existing operation name]”, “changes”: { “description”: “[improved description]”, “instruction template”: “[improved template]” }, “reasoning”: “[how these changes address the identified failures]” } } ] }

### No changes needed: { “action”: “no change”, “reasoning”: “[why the current operations are sufficient]” }

## Instruction Template Structure When writing instruction templates, follow this structure:

Skill: [Short skill name] Purpose: [What this skill does] When to use:

- - [Trigger 1]
- - [Trigger 2] How to apply:
- - [Step 1]
- - [Step 2] Constraints:
- - [What to avoid] Action type: [INSERT only — UPDATE only] Output ONLY the JSON, no other text.

LLM Judge Prompt

You are an expert judge evaluating the quality of an answer for a QA task. Your goal is to determine whether the model’s answer correctly and sufficiently answers the given question.

Read the following information carefully:

[Question] {question}

[Ground Truth Answers] {ground truth}

[Model Answer] {model answer}

Your evaluation criteria:

- 1. Correctness:

- - Is the model answer factually consistent with ANY of the correct answers?
- - Does it avoid contradictions or introducing false information?

- 2. Relevance:

- Does the answer address the question directly without unnecessary content?

- 3. Completeness:

- - Does the answer include all essential information needed to fully answer the question?
- - Partial answers are allowed but should receive lower scores. Scoring Rules:
- - Score = 1.0 if the answer is fully correct.
- - Score = 0.5 if the answer is partially correct but incomplete or slightly inaccurate.
- - Score = 0.0 if the answer is incorrect, irrelevant, or contradicts the ground truth.

Output Format (STRICT): Return your output as a JSON dictionary with two fields: { “explanation”: “<brief explanation of your reasoning>”, ”score”: <0.0 — 0.5 — 1.0>}

Be concise and objective. Do not include anything outside the JSON.

##### E. Use of Large Language Models

LLMs are used as part of our method and evaluation pipeline. Specifically, MemSkill uses an LLM executor for skillconditioned memory generation, an LLM designer for skill evolution, and an LLM judge for evaluation on tasks where automatic metrics are insufficient. The corresponding prompts are provided in Appendix D.

LLM-based tools may also be used for grammar polishing and code assistance. The authors take full responsibility for all scientific claims, experimental results, figures, and references in this paper.

##### F. Limitations and Societal Impact

Limitations. This work focuses on benchmarked research settings for skill-conditioned memory construction. Practical deployments of agent memory systems may require additional mechanisms for privacy protection, user consent, access control, and data retention. These considerations are orthogonal to the core algorithmic contribution of MemSkill and are left for future deployment-oriented studies.

Societal impact. MemSkill contributes toward more adaptive and reusable memory mechanisms for long-horizon LLM agents. Instead of repeatedly designing task-specific memory pipelines, the proposed skill-based formulation allows memory behaviors to be learned, reused, and evolved from interaction traces, which may lower the engineering barrier for building memory-augmented agents. This can benefit research and practical applications that require long-term context management, such as personalized assistants, educational agents, research support tools, and embodied task-solving systems. Since agent memory may involve user-provided or task-specific information, practical deployments should follow standard data governance practices, including user consent, privacy protection, data retention control, and mechanisms for inspecting or deleting stored memories. Our work focuses on benchmarked research settings and does not target surveillance, deception, or high-stakes decision making.
