### Abstract

LLM agents increasingly rely on external inference conditions: prompts, tools, memory, SOPs, skills, and harness feedback. These assets can improve task execution without changing model weights, but they are often revised by heuristic reflection or by reusing observed successes and failures as if counts alone were reliable belief. We introduce BayesianAgent, a native and cross-harness framework that treats reusable skills and SOPs as hypotheses about whether a frozen model will succeed under a particular prompt, context, and harness environment. Bayesian-Agent records verified trajectory evidence, maintains a featureconditioned categorical posterior over each skill, and maps posterior state into inspectable actions such as patch, split, compress, retire, and explore. Model-facing prompts receive executable guardrails and failure-mode patches, while posterior summaries remain available for audit. With deepseek-v4-flash, incremental repair improves SOP-Bench from 80% to 95%, Lifelong AgentBench from 90% to 100%, and RealFin-Bench from 45% to 65%. We further evaluate Bayesian-Agent’s native backend and optional GenericAgent, mini-sweagent, and Claude Code backends. The results include positive, negative, saturated, and case-study settings, suggesting that agent skill evolution is best viewed as posterior-guided harness optimization rather than uncalibrated prompt accumulation.

### 1 Introduction

Large language model (LLM) agents increasingly solve tasks through an inference environment rather than through model weights alone. A modern agent interleaves reasoning, tool calls, memory access,

browser or computer actions, and environment feedback (Yao et al., 2023; Schick et al., 2023; Zhou

- et al., 2024; Yang et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2025). As this harness becomes richer, the reusable assets around the model, including prompts, tools, memories, standard operating procedures (SOPs), and skills, begin to determine what the same base model can reliably do. This shift is visible in recent agent systems that package experience into memories or reusable routines (Packer et al., 2023; Liang et al., 2026), and in skill-centered work indicating that procedural packages can substantially alter task success (Wang et al., 2023; Li et al., 2026; Zheng
- et al., 2025a; Ye et al., 2025). If a base model samples from P(X | θ), an agent samples from P(X | θ,C), where C contains the prompt, context, tools, memory, and harness feedback. The resulting question is not only how to prompt a model, but how to maintain the external decision environment that the model acts through.

The difficulty is that externalizing capability also externalizes failure. More context is not automatically better: long-context studies show that useful information can become hard to retrieve depending on position and effective context length (Liu et al., 2024; An et al., 2025), while compression work makes clear that the value of a context budget depends on what is preserved (Jiang et al., 2024). Skills and SOPs introduce a related challenge. A skill may encode a good workflow, a brittle workaround, a stale assumption, or a taskspecific patch that should not be reused. If an agent updates such assets only from a natural-language self-critique, it can repair the current failure while admitting noisy edits that hurt later tasks. Conversely, if a harness never revises its skills, repeated failures remain outside the model’s parametric learning loop.

We argue that harness skills should be treated as evidence-bearing hypotheses. A frequency-style maintenance loop can count successes and failures

after the fact, but sparse agent trajectories are rarely independent, identically distributed observations: the same skill can be reliable in one benchmark context, harmful in another, and ambiguous after only a few runs. Instead of asking an LLM to decide, in isolation, whether a skill is good, a harness can ask a narrower Bayesian question: under a frozen model and a given inference environment, what should we believe about this skill after combining prior assumptions with verified evidence? This view connects agent engineering to Bayesian optimization and probabilistic modeling, where expensive evaluations motivate belief-guided search rather than uncalibrated trial and error (Shahriari et al., 2016; Frazier, 2018; Murphy, 2012). The object of inference in our setting, however, is not a model hyperparameter or a latent answer distribution; it is a persistent harness-side skill or SOP that changes the next run’s context.

We introduce Bayesian-Agent, a Bayesian evidence layer and first-party native backend for selfevolving LLM agents. The framework records verified trajectories from an execution harness, maintains a feature-conditioned belief over each skill’s success and failure modes, and maps that belief into inspectable rewrite actions: explore, patch, split, compress, or retire. The model-facing prompt receives executable guardrails and failuremode patches rather than raw posterior numbers, while the posterior audit remains available for ranking and debugging. Bayesian-Agent can run in a full mode, where the registry evolves online from scratch, or an incremental mode, where an existing agent run supplies evidence and only failed tasks are repaired. The framework includes its own minimal native harness, while GenericAgent, mini-swe-agent, and Claude Code are treated as optional backends behind the same trajectoryevidence boundary.

Our contributions are:

- • We formulate reusable agent skills and SOPs as Bayesian evidence objects, shifting selfevolution from empirical prompt accumulation toward verified posterior-guided optimization under uncertainty.
- • We introduce a unified Bayesian view of prompt, context, and harness engineering, and instantiate it with an efficient categorical evidence model, posterior-guided rewrite policy, native backend, and adapter boundary for external harnesses.

• We provide an empirical study on SOPBench, Lifelong AgentBench, and RealFinBench with deepseek-v4-flash and deepseek-v4-pro. The study compares baseline, full Bayesian, and incremental repair variants across GenericAgent and additional execution backends, including Bayesian-Agent’s native backend, mini-sweagent, and Claude Code. We further include skill-evolution case studies showing how posterior evidence turns repeated output-file and format failures into concrete harness patches.

### 2 Related Work

LLM agents and harness engineering. LLM agents extend prompting into systems that reason, act, call tools, operate interfaces, and receive environment feedback. ReAct introduced a compact reasoning-action loop (Yao et al., 2023), while Toolformer showed that tool-use behavior can be induced from self-supervised signals (Schick et al., 2023). Subsequent systems and benchmarks broadened the harness around the model: cognitive architectures organize memory, action, and decision components (Sumers et al., 2024); Generative Agents, MetaGPT, WebArena, GAIA, and Mind2Web study social simulation, multi-agent workflows, web environments, and general assistant tasks (Park et al., 2023; Hong et al., 2024; Zhou et al., 2024; Mialon et al., 2024; Deng et al., 2023); SWE-agent and OpenHands highlight the importance of agent-computer interfaces for software tasks (Yang et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2025). A parallel line studies how to manage finite context through memory and compression (Packer et al., 2023; Jiang et al., 2024), and GenericAgent specifically frames long-horizon agent performance as context information density maximization with atomic tools, hierarchical memory, selfevolution, and compression (Liang et al., 2026). These works indicate that the harness is a major locus of agent capability. Bayesian-Agent takes this observation as its starting point but asks a different question: once the harness contains persistent skills and SOPs, how should the harness decide which of them to preserve, patch, split, compress, or retire based on verified evidence?

Self-evolving agents, skills, and SOPs. Selfimproving agents accumulate experience outside model weights through reflection, memory,

reusable code, policies, or skills. Reflexion and ExpeL convert trajectories into verbal feedback or experiential knowledge for future decisions (Shinn et al., 2023; Zhao et al., 2024); Voyager builds an expanding skill library from environment interaction (Wang et al., 2023); Agent-Pro treats the agent policy itself as a target for reflective revision (Zhang et al., 2024). More recent skill-centered work makes the unit of improvement explicit. SkillsBench evaluates whether skill packages help across domains and reports that curated skills can help substantially but may also introduce negative deltas on some tasks (Li et al., 2026). SkillWeaver, SOP-Agent, CUA-Skill, and MemSkill explore self-discovered web skills, SOPguided agents, computer-use skills, and evolving memory skills (Zheng et al., 2025a; Ye et al., 2025; Chen et al., 2026; Zhang et al., 2026). GenericAgent is closest in spirit because it turns verified trajectories into reusable SOPs and code inside an execution harness (Liang et al., 2026). Our distinction is not that prior work ignores experience, but that its skill updates are usually proposed or admitted through LLM-generated reflection, taskspecific validation, or heuristic rules. BayesianAgent makes the evidence state itself explicit: each reusable harness skill is associated with a posterior over success, costs, contexts, and repeated failure modes, so skill evolution becomes an auditable inference-and-policy problem rather than only a text-rewriting problem.

Bayesian and evidence-guided optimization of agent-side decision environments. Bayesian optimization provides a mature vocabulary for improving expensive black-box systems by maintaining beliefs over uncertain evaluations and using those beliefs to allocate trials (Snoek et al., 2012; Shahriari et al., 2016; Frazier, 2018; Bergstra et al., 2011; Rasmussen and Williams, 2006). Probabilistic machine learning and graphical-model texts similarly emphasize explicit uncertainty, likelihood assumptions, and posterior updates (Murphy, 2012; Koller and Friedman, 2009). Recent work has begun to combine Bayesian ideas with LLMs: BIRD wraps LLM decisions in a Bayesian inference framework (Feng et al., 2025), calibration research studies whether model confidence can be made reliable (Guo et al., 2017; Xiong et al., 2024), and BayesAgent uses verbalized probabilistic graphical modeling to improve uncertainty-aware agentic reasoning within individual tasks (Huang et al., 2026).

Bayesian-Agent is complementary to these efforts. Rather than optimizing a latent answer graph, calibrating a prediction, or choosing a per-question solution path, it optimizes the reusable external substrate that conditions many future agent runs. The Bayesian object is therefore a harness skill/SOP and its failure-mode patches, not the answer distribution for a single problem.

### 3 Method

#### 3.1 Problem Formulation

Let Mθ denote a frozen LLM or agentic model, and let Ct denote the inference environment supplied by the harness at task t: prompts, tool interfaces, retrieved context, memories, SOPs, skills, and runtime constraints. We focus on a reusable harness skill hk, which may be a natural-language skill, SOP, failure-mode patch, or compact procedural instruction. Given a task instance xt, the harness executes the agent and receives a verified binary outcome yt ∈ {0,1} from the benchmark grader or execution contract. The central quantity is not a new model parameter, but the reliability of the external skill under observed evidence:

pk,t = P(yt = 1 | Mθ,Ct,hk,zt), (1)

where zt = g(et) is a discrete feature vector extracted from a verified trajectory et. This formulation keeps model weights fixed and treats harness evolution as optimization over the conditions under which the model is run.

This gives a single Bayesian language for prompt, context, and harness engineering. We decompose the inference environment as

##### Ct = (Pt,Rt,At,Vt), (2)

where Pt is the model-facing prompt and skill text, Rt is retrieved or remembered context, At is the tool and action interface supplied by the harness, and Vt is the verifier or feedback channel that turns execution into evidence. Prompt engineering changes Pt, context engineering changes Rt, and harness engineering changes At or Vt. BayesianAgent treats these choices as interventions on the same conditional environment Ct, rather than as separate heuristics.

Given posterior belief state Bt, the harness chooses an environment intervention δt from a restricted action set ∆, such as adding a failure-mode

patch to Pt, compressing context in Rt, or changing how harness feedback is exposed. The ideal Bayesian decision is

Sδ = P(yt = 1 | Mθ,Ctδ,hk,zt), δt⋆ = arg max

EBt Sδ − λcostCost(Ctδ) ,

δ∈∆

(3)

where Ctδ is the edited inference environment. The implemented system instantiates this decision rule conservatively through the posterior-guided skill actions in Eq. 12, because small online datasets do not justify an unconstrained search over all possible prompts, contexts, and harness programs.

A simple frequentist-style empirical alternative would estimate skill reliability by observed frequency:

1[yi = 1, g(ei) = z] ei∈Dk,t 1[g(ei) = z]

pˆk,t(z) = ei∈Dk,t

, (4)

with a backoff to the global rate when the denominator is zero. This estimator is useful as a diagnostic, but it is a poor decision rule for harness evolution: the evidence is sparse, context-conditioned, and expensive to collect; a single failure can be either a noisy accident or the first sign of a reusable failure mode. Bayesian-Agent therefore treats the frequency counts as evidence for a posterior belief, not as the belief itself. The prior supplies conservative smoothing when observations are few, and the posterior separates what the harness has observed from how strongly it should act on that observation.

#### 3.2 Trajectory Evidence

Bayesian-Agent updates beliefs only from verified trajectories. Each trajectory is represented as

##### et = (xt,hk,ct,yt,ut,τt,ℓt,rt,mt), (5)

where ct is the benchmark or task context, ut is total token cost, τt is turn count, ℓt is elapsed time, rt is a verifier-derived failure mode, and mt contains short scalar metadata. The outcome yt comes from the benchmark verifier or output contract rather than from the model’s own self-assessment. This distinction is important: the LLM may propose explanations or repairs, but the belief state is updated by externally checked evidence.

The feature map g discretizes runtime signals:

zt = g(et) = (ct,rt,bu(ut),bτ(τt),bℓ(ℓt),m≤t 80), (6)

where bu,bτ,bℓ map token count, turn count, and latency into fixed buckets, and m≤t 80 keeps only short scalar metadata. This bucketing is an engineering choice for small online datasets: it preserves the failure signatures needed by the harness while avoiding brittle continuous-density assumptions.

The same schema supports two execution modes. In full mode, the registry starts empty and is updated online after every task. In incremental mode, the harness first reads an existing agent run, updates the registry from its verified successes and failures, and reruns only failed tasks with posterior-guided patches. Incremental mode therefore measures a plug-in repair setting, while full mode measures whether a Bayesian skill registry can evolve during a complete run without prior traces.

#### 3.3 Bayesian Evidence Model

The default backend is a feature-conditioned categorical Bayesian evidence model. Let Dk,t = {ei : i ≤ t,ei uses hk} be the evidence set for skill hk. For binary labels Y = {0,1}, let Nk,ℓ be the number of trajectories with label ℓ, and let Nk,j,ℓ,v count how often feature j takes value v under label ℓ. With Laplace smoothing λ = 1, the class prior is

Nk,ℓ + λ ℓ′∈Y Nk,ℓ′ + λ|Y|

. (7)

πk,t(ℓ) =

For a categorical feature value zj = v, the smoothed likelihood is

Nk,j,ℓ,v + λ v′∈Vk,j,t Nk,j,ℓ,v′ + λ|Vk,j,t ∪ {v}|

θk,j,t(ℓ) (v) =

.

(8) The implementation uses a factorized categorical likelihood score:

m

θk,j,t(ℓ) (zj). (9)

p˜k,t(ℓ | z) = πk,t(ℓ)

j=1

After normalization, the success posterior used for ranking and context selection is

p˜k,t(1 | z) p˜k,t(0 | z) + p˜k,t(1 | z)

. (10)

sk,t(z) =

All products are computed in log space before normalization. The registry also maintains the conjugate Beta-Bernoulli summary

Action Default trigger Explore No observations are available, or the poste-

rior remains uncertain. Patch The same failure mode appears at least twice.

Split At least three contexts and four observations suggest a broad skill is covering heterogeneous cases.

Compress At least three observations and estimated success probability at or above 0.72. Retire Failure evidence dominates: β ≥ 4 and estimated success probability below 0.45.

- Table 1: Default posterior-guided skill actions. Thresholds are implementation defaults, not claimed optima.

with α0 = β0 = 1 and mean αk,t/(αk,t + βk,t). The reported experiments use the categorical evidence model for posterior scoring; the BetaBernoulli state is retained for compatibility, audit display, and conservative failure-dominance checks. We therefore do not claim full Bayesian model selection over competing skill hypotheses. The contribution is an efficient posterior evidence layer for harness-side skill maintenance.

#### 3.4 Posterior-Guided Skill Actions

The posterior state is consumed by a rewrite policy that emits one of five inspectable actions. Let Fk(r) be the count of failure mode r, and let Ck

be the set of contexts observed for skill hk. Writing E,R,P,S,C for explore, retire, patch, split, and compress, the deployed policy is the ordered decision rule



E, |Dk| = 0,

- R, βk ≥ 4, sk(∅) < 0.45, P, maxr Fk(r) ≥ 2,
- S, |Ck| ≥ 3, |Dk| ≥ 4, C, |Dk| ≥ 3, sk(∅) ≥ 0.72, E, otherwise.

(12)

π(Bk) =



The policy is intentionally conservative: it should expose why a skill is being changed and avoid unnecessary textual drift.

The actions define how evidence can change the skill substrate. Patch turns repeated failure modes into concrete guardrails, such as checking for a required output file before terminating. Split prevents one broad SOP from serving incompatible task contexts. Compress keeps reliable skills concise so that useful context is not crowded out. Retire marks a skill as unreliable when failures dominate. These actions are easy to replace in downstream

harnesses, but the default thresholds provide a reproducible baseline.

3.5 Model-Facing Context and Harness Boundary

Bayesian-Agent separates posterior audit information from model-facing instructions. Posterior summaries include estimated success, contextconditioned success, observations, costs, and failure modes; they are stored for ranking and debugging. The LLM prompt, however, receives executable skill text: stable benchmark guardrails and repeated failure-mode patches. This avoids asking the model to reason directly over posterior numbers and keeps the prompt aligned with concrete actions.

The implementation includes a first-party na-

tive backend. The native harness provides a small OpenAI-compatible chat client, workspace-scoped tools, a turn loop, usage accounting, transcript capture, and trajectory persistence. This backend is intentionally minimal: execution remains observable, while durable improvement is assigned to Bayesian skill evolution rather than to an opaque runtime.

External harnesses use the same boundary through an adapter contract. GenericAgent, miniswe-agent, and Claude Code execute tasks and expose trajectory-like outputs; Bayesian-Agent owns evidence ingestion, belief updates, policy decisions, skill-context rendering, and skill-evolution records. Any additional harness can use the mechanism if it emits the trajectory schema and accepts skill/SOP text. Thus, Bayesian-Agent is both a native backend and a portable Bayesian skill-evolution layer around external execution harnesses.

### 4 Experiments

#### 4.1 Setup

We evaluate Bayesian-Agent from two complementary views. The first view compares GenericAgent execution without Bayesian skill optimization against two Bayesian-Agent variants under the same task-completion and token metrics. GA denotes the GenericAgent execution baseline, BAFull starts with an empty Bayesian skill registry and updates it online during a full benchmark pass, and BA-Inc attaches after a GA run, ingests verified traces, and reruns only failed tasks with posterior-guided skill context. We evaluate these variants with deepseek-v4-flash and deepseek-v4-pro.

We then run a backend ablation over four execution backends: Bayesian-Agent’s native backend, GenericAgent, mini-swe-agent, and Claude Code. All four backends have baseline, full, and incremental Bayesian runs for both DeepSeek backbones.

The benchmark suite covers three kinds of agent behavior. SOP-Bench tests multi-step procedural execution over industrial SOPs (Nandi et al., 2025). Lifelong AgentBench evaluates whether agents can handle sequential tasks with reusable cross-task experience (Zheng et al., 2025b). RealFin-Bench evaluates financial reasoning when important premises may be implicit or missing (Dai et al., 2026). The evaluation uses the same setup as GenericAgent (Liang et al., 2026).

We report task accuracy, input tokens, output to-

kens, total tokens, and an efficiency score. Table 2 compares GA, OpenClaw, Claude Code, GPT-5.4, and the DeepSeek BA-Full and BA-Inc variants under the same benchmark-level metrics. For GA and BA-Full, token usage covers the full benchmark run. For BA-Inc, token usage is repair-only, because the baseline run has already happened; final accuracy is still measured after applying repair to GA failures. Section 4.4 reports cumulative token accounting.

#### 4.2 Main Results

Table 2 compares existing agent baselines with Bayesian-Agent variants under shared accuracy and token metrics. The largest Bayesian gains occur in settings where the initial GA run leaves procedural failures that can be revisited. On the flash backbone, BA-Full changes SOP-Bench from 16/20 solved tasks to 19/20 and RealFin-Bench from 18/40 to 21/40, while reducing total tokens in both cases. The incremental setting is more targeted: it converts 3 of 4 SOP-Bench failures, 2 of 2 Lifelong AgentBench failures, and 8 of 22 RealFinBench failures, yielding final accuracies of 95%, 100%, and 65%, respectively. These results support the plug-in repair setting: a harness can spend additional inference on failed cases while turning observed failure modes into reusable skill context.

Full mode is not uniformly better. On Lifelong AgentBench with deepseek-v4-flash, BA-Full reaches 85% compared with GA’s 90%. This negative case suggests that online skill evolution can introduce cost or ordering effects when evidence is still sparse. The incremental run avoids this fullrun exposure by using GA’s completed trace first and then targeting only failed tasks, reaching 100% final accuracy with 84k repair tokens.

The stronger deepseek-v4-pro setting is partly saturated. SOP-Bench and Lifelong AgentBench have no failed GA tasks to revisit, which leaves BAInc inactive and makes BA-Full mainly a preservation test. RealFin-Bench remains difficult: GA solves 24/40 tasks, BA-Full solves 26/40, and BAInc solves 27/40 after converting 3 of 16 baseline failures. The comparison report attributes several remaining RealFin failures to missing cache paths or domain-data availability, so the residual error should not be interpreted only as a reasoning failure.

- Table 2: Task completion rate and token efficiency across the main agent benchmarks and RealFin-Bench. BA-Full runs Bayesian skill evolution over a full benchmark pass. BA-Inc is a repair-only setting: its tokens count only incremental repair attempts, while its accuracy is the final score after repairing GA failures.

4.3 Backend Ablation

- Table 3 and Figure 2 test whether the Bayesian layer is tied to one harness implementation. The native backend executes all three benchmarks, captures trajectories, and improves the flash setting from 95% to 100% on SOP-Bench and Lifelong AgentBench, and from 62.5% to 72.5% final accuracy on RealFin-Bench. The mini-swe-agent backend gives a different pattern: flash SOP-Bench is already saturated at baseline, but incremental repair improves Lifelong AgentBench from 85% to 100% and RealFin-Bench from 60% to 70%. Claude Code provides an additional adapter stress test on both DeepSeek backbones: with flash, BAFull improves SOP-Bench from 90% to 100%, and BA-Inc improves RealFin-Bench from 77.5% to 87.5% by repairing 4 of 9 failed tasks; with pro-1m, BA-Full improves SOP-Bench from 65% to 95%,

BA-Inc reaches 100% by repairing 7 of 7 failed SOP tasks, and RealFin-Bench improves from 65% to 75% by repairing 4 of 14 failed tasks. Lifelong AgentBench is saturated at 100% for Claude Code pro-1m. Across these repair-enabled backends, the evidence supports the adapter claim: BayesianAgent needs verified trajectories and a place to inject skill text, not a particular runtime.

The ablation also shows why the Bayesian framing matters. A pure frequency comparison would mostly rank backends by their observed baseline accuracy, which mixes model behavior, harness affordances, token budget, and benchmark difficulty. Bayesian-Agent instead uses each backend’s own verified trajectories to decide whether the next action should be exploration, patching, splitting, compression, or retirement. This makes the repair decision local to the evidence available for that

- 4.4 Repair-Only and Cumulative Cost

BA-Inc has two meaningful cost views. The repaironly view measures the marginal cost of adding Bayesian-Agent to an already completed baseline run. Under this view, the GenericAgent flash repairs use 153k tokens on SOP-Bench, 84k on Lifelong AgentBench, and 2.02M on RealFin-Bench, while pro RealFin repair uses 1.72M. The cumulative view adds the original GA run: the corresponding cumulative totals are 1.55M, 774k, 6.26M, and

- 5.44M tokens. Claude Code follows the same accounting. For flash, SOP repair uses 366k tokens after a 5.89M-token baseline, Lifelong has no failed tasks to rerun, and RealFin repair uses 7.19M tokens after a 49.41M-token baseline, giving cumulative totals of 6.25M, 1.55M, and 56.61M tokens.

For pro-1m, SOP repair uses 977k tokens after a 2.76M-token baseline, Lifelong again has no failed tasks, and RealFin repair uses 14.45M tokens after a 27.03M-token baseline, giving cumulative totals of 3.74M, 1.55M, and 41.48M tokens. Repair-only tokens describe the marginal cost of post hoc skill repair, whereas cumulative totals are the appropriate quantity when comparing total end-to-end cost from scratch.

#### 4.5 Skill Evolution Artifacts

Every Bayesian run records before/after skillevolution snapshots, including posterior audit text, model-facing skill context, belief files, and task results. In RealFin with deepseek-v4-flash, full mode records 40 before/after pairs and incremental mode records 22 repair-attempt pairs. In the SOP/Lifelong incremental run, failed GA cases

similarly produce before/after skill snapshots for targeted repair. These records make the evolution process inspectable: the registry records whether the policy compressed a stable skill, patched repeated failures, or retired an unreliable skill. Appendix C gives concrete examples of this process.

#### 4.6 Discussion

The experiments suggest that Bayesian-Agent is most useful when an existing harness leaves recoverable procedural failures. With deepseek-v4-flash, incremental repair improves SOP-Bench, Lifelong AgentBench, and RealFinBench final accuracy while spending tokens only on failed tasks. The backend ablation further indicates that the same evidence loop can be evaluated with Bayesian-Agent’s native backend and with external backends such as GenericAgent, mini-sweagent, and Claude Code on both DeepSeek backbones, provided that the harness exposes verified trajectories and accepts skill text.

The results also clarify the boundary of the approach. Full online evolution is not uniformly beneficial, as the Lifelong AgentBench flash setting shows. A frequentist estimate is often adequate when observations are stable and plentiful, but agent skill evolution usually involves sparse, expensive, context-dependent trajectories. BayesianAgent is therefore most appropriate for repeated tasks with verifiers, recurring failure modes, and a controllable place to inject skill text. It is less appropriate for one-off tasks, subjective labels, highly nonstationary environments, or failures caused by missing tools or unavailable data.

### 5 Conclusion

We presented Bayesian-Agent, a native and crossharness framework that treats reusable agent skills and SOPs as evidence-bearing hypotheses. Instead of relying only on an LLM’s own judgment or on raw empirical counts to revise skills, the framework records verified trajectories, updates a categorical Bayesian evidence model, and turns posterior state into inspectable skill actions and executable failuremode patches.

Across the evaluated benchmarks and backends, the results support the central methodological claim: harness skill evolution should be evidencecalibrated, auditable, and explicit about uncertainty. Future work should replace the default conservative policy with richer Bayesian decision policies, test posterior-guided repair through additional adapters, and study how skill beliefs can be shared across models and deployments.

### Limitations

Backend coverage remains limited. The main taskcompletion table centers on GenericAgent, while the backend ablation adds Bayesian-Agent’s native backend, mini-swe-agent, and Claude Code, so broad plug-and-play generality across many independent harness/model pairs remains future work.

The default Bayesian backend is a factorized categorical evidence model with Laplace smoothing, not full Bayesian structure learning or full Bayesian model selection. The formulation is most useful when verified evidence can be collected and reused; one-off tasks, subjective labels, nonstationary environments, and missing-tool failures may not benefit. Skill evolution is also not monotonic: BA-Full underperforms GA on Lifelong AgentBench with deepseek-v4-flash, suggesting that online updates can introduce ordering effects when evidence is sparse.

### Ethical Considerations

This work studies harness-side reliability mechanisms for LLM agents. The experiments use benchmark tasks and existing experiment records; no human-subject data are collected. Improving agent repair and skill reuse can reduce repeated operational failures, but it can also make agents more persistent in pursuing a task. For this reason, BayesianAgent keeps posterior audit records and exposes failure-mode patches so that skill evolution can be inspected rather than silently hidden in model behavior. The method does not remove risks inherited from the base model, execution harness, tools, or benchmark data, and it should be paired with task-appropriate permission checks, logging, and human oversight in deployment.

### A Additional Method Details

Evidence features. The default categorical evidence model uses a compact feature set: benchmark context, failure mode, token bucket, turn bucket, latency bucket, and selected short scalar metadata. The implementation also records raw token counts, elapsed seconds, and task metadata for auditing. This design keeps posterior updates cheap enough to run after every task while still exposing which failure modes and runtime signatures are repeatedly associated with success or failure.

Policy boundary. The policy in Table 1 is a default harness policy rather than a theoretical optimum. Downstream systems may replace the thresholds, use contextual bandits, or train a richer decision policy over the same evidence schema. The important interface is that the policy consumes verified evidence and emits explicit skill actions.

### B Additional Token Accounting

For BA-Inc, the experiments report repair-only tokens because this mode attaches after an existing GA run. Cumulative cost is still important when comparing end-to-end cost from scratch. On deepseek-v4-flash, cumulative totals are 1.55M tokens for SOP-Bench, 774k for Lifelong AgentBench, and 6.26M for RealFin-Bench. On deepseek-v4-pro, cumulative RealFin-Bench cost is 5.44M tokens. For pro SOP-Bench and Lifelong AgentBench, BA-Inc performs no repair because GA already solves all tasks. For Claude Code with deepseek-v4-pro[1m], incremental repair uses 977k tokens on SOP-Bench and 14.45M on RealFin-Bench, giving cumulative costs of 3.74M and 41.48M tokens; Lifelong AgentBench has no failed baseline tasks.

### C Case Study: How Skills Evolve

Skill-evolution records show how posterior evidence becomes model-facing skill text. Full mode records before/after pairs for each task, while incremental mode records pairs for the failed GA tasks selected for repair. Each pair includes a posterior audit file, model-facing skill context, a belief snapshot, and the task result. Figure 3 visualizes one representative trace from each benchmark.

Benchmark-specific evolution. The SOP-Bench trace illustrates patch behavior: three verified blank-output failures promote a guardrail into the model-facing skill context, and the repaired task

succeeds with the raw category backorder. The Lifelong AgentBench trace is different: the posterior is already high, the task succeeds with an exact SQL statement, and the policy keeps the skill compact rather than adding a long rewrite. The RealFin trace is deliberately negative. Before task_34_etf_constituent_arbitrage, the incremental registry has 56 observations and a retire decision because missing output files dominate the failure evidence; after the failed repair, the same failure mode is preserved and the posterior falls further.

Figures 4–6 present benchmark-specific before/after model-facing skill texts for one representative task from each benchmark.

Interpretation. These cases provide interpretability evidence rather than causal proof that every patch improves every later task. The framework preserves a traceable chain from verifier outcome to evidence features, from evidence features to posterior audit, and from posterior audit to model-facing skill edits. This traceability is the main benefit of placing harness skill evolution under an explicit Bayesian evidence frame.

Lifelong lifelong_0

After repair fails: missing_output β = 33, posterior=0.441 redesign signal strengthens

SOP-Bench shows a recurring failure mode becoming a concrete patch, Lifelong AgentBench shows stable evidence leading to compact skill context, and RealFin-Bench shows a negative case where repeated output-file failures strengthen a retire/redesign decision rather than being hidden.
